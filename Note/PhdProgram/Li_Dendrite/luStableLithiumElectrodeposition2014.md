# Stable lithium electrodeposition in liquid and nanoporous solid electrolytes

A long-held view is that unstable electrodeposition is a consequence of inherent characteristics
of these metals and their inability to form uniform electrodeposits on surfaces with inevitable defects. We report on
electrodeposition of lithium in simple liquid electrolytes and in nanoporous solids infused with liquid electrolyte.

liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated salt blends

## Introduction

1. Among all the solid-states batteries based approacher, ceramic electrolytes are the most promising solution to stabilize the lithium electrodeposition.

    A ceramic electrolyte with modulus above the shear modulus of the metallic anode can prevent dendrites from crossing the inter-electrode space.

    Vexing problem : at normal temperature, the ionic conductivity of ceramic is too low

    We can use a thinner solid electrolyte or operate the batteries at elevated temperature. but dentrite still forms.

    Recent study suggests that with nanoporous ceramics  that host a low-volatility and electrochemically stable liquid electrolyte in the pores, we get to operate on lower temperature.

    Post-mortem inspection shows that dendrites are still able to nucleate and proliferate but unable to penetrate the pores

2. secondary batteries based on some metals like Mg, show no evidence of electrode instability and dendrite formation under deposition conditions where dendrites form in others.

    DFT analysis of Mg and Li electrodeposits at vacuum/metal interface reveals than Mg-Mg bond is 0.18eV stronger compared with a Li-Li bond

    $\to$ lower dimension and fibre-like Mg deposit spontaneously transforming to higher-dimension crystal is much more likely to happen.

3. Joint DFT shows that with the halide anions in a electrolyte produces lower activation energy barrier for Li diffusion at electrolyte/(lithium metal) interface.

    current report : stability of lithium electrodeposition in common liquid electrolytes reinforced with halogenated lithium salts.

## Experimental Details

Electrolytes containing 1 M Li cations were studied in

1. liquid form
2. as liquids but infused in nanoporous solids
3. in both cases, electrolytes were blended with predetermined amount of halogenated lithium.
