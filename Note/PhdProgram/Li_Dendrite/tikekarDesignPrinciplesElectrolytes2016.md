# Design principles for electrolytes and interfaces for stable lithium-metal batteries

1. Li-metal anodes with specific capacity more than ten times that of $LiC_6$
2. discuss the key variables that govern the stability

## introduction

1. LMB consists of
    1. Li-metal anode
    2. Li-ion conduction electrolyte
    3. cathode
