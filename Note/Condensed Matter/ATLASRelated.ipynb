    "2. empirical potential methods\n",

    "Quantum mechanical methods based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory, which require evaluation of the kinetic energy term related to single-electron wave functions. The cost of calculation of electron density scales as cubic relation of the total number of electrons of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaches to reduce the computational cost:\n",
    "1. based on nearsightedness and locality $\\rightarrow$ linear scaling $\\rightarrow$ suitable for band-gap structure or localized electronic structure.\n",
    "2. based on empirical interatomic potentials $\\rightarrow$ neglect the properties of electrons $\\rightarrow$ inaccurate and unreliable.\n",
    "3. OF-DFT\n",
    "   1. Advantages:\n",
    "      1. total energy os expressed as an explicit functional of electron density in the Hohenbergâ€“Kohn theorem\n",
    "      2. no need to deal with wave function\n",
    "      3. computational cost  scaled quasi-linearly with the number of atoms on the system\n",
    "   2. Drawbacks:\n",
    "      1. the construction of kinetic energy functional(KEDF) \n",
    "      2. Orbital free $\\rightarrow$ ion-electron interaction can only be described by the local  pseudopotentials (LPPs)\n",
