## 2002 Robustness of multiparty entanglement

### Introduction

#### Question

- how common is large-scale entanglement?

#### Intuitions

- entanglement seems fragile under decoherence
- Volume of inseparable states is much larger

#### Research Approach

- study how fast the entanglement disappears, quantifying the robustness
- Noise:

  - partially depolarizing channel
  - act on subsystem independently

- State:

  - $|GHZ\rangle$
  - spin-squeezed state

### Results

#### GHZ

$$
d_{crit} =1- s_{c r i t}(n)=1- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{2-2 / n}+1}}
$$

- robustness increases with the number of atoms
- GHZ is the comparatively robust

#### Spin Squeezed

attained after a quantum process that decreases the variance of one of the angular momentum components in an ensemble of particles with a spin.

$$
\xi^{2}=\frac{n\left\langle J_{x}^{2}\right\rangle}{\left\langle J_{y}\right\rangle^{2}+\left\langle J_{z}\right\rangle^{2}}
$$

if $\xi<1$, the state is entangled. Given a large amount of atoms, we could have state with $\left\langle J_{z}\right\rangle=\zeta n / 2$, $\langle J_X\rangle = \langle J_Y\rangle = 0$.

$$
d_{crit} = 1- s_{c r i t}=1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\zeta^{2}\left(1-\xi_{0}^{2}\right)}}
$$

- robustness increases with the number of atoms

### Conclusion

- multiparty entanglement surprisingly robust
- large scale entanglement could be more frequent in natural systems
- entanglement generation
