The zero and finite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermion, and boson model systems are discussed. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. In equilibrium entanglement is shown tightly connected to the characteristics of the phase diagram. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test.

We show that the lifetime of (distillable) entanglement for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) -type superposition states decreases with the size of the system, while for a class of other states—namely, all graph states with constant degree—the lifetime is independent of the system size. We show that these results are largely independent of the specific decoherence model and are in particular valid for all models which deal with individual couplings of particles to independent environments, described by some quantum optical master equation of Lindblad form. For GHZ states, we derive analytic expressions for the lifetime of distillable entanglement and determine when the state becomes fully separable. For all graph states, we derive lower and upper bounds on the lifetime of entanglement. The lower bound is based on a specific distillation protocol, while upper bounds are obtained by showing that states resulting from decoherence in general become nondistillable or even separable after a finite time. This is done using different methods, namely, (i) the map describing the decoherence process (e.g., the action of a thermal bath on the system) becomes entanglement breaking, (ii) the resulting state becomes separable, and (iii) the partial transposition with respect to certain partitions becomes positive. To this aim, we establish a method to calculate the spectrum of the partial transposition for all mixed states which are diagonal in a graph-state basis. We also consider entanglement between different groups of particles and determine the corresponding lifetimes as well as the change of the kind of entanglement with time. This enables us to investigate the behavior of entanglement under rescaling and in the limit of large number of particles N→∞. Finally we investigate the lifetime of encoded quantum superposition states and show that one can define an effective time in the encoded system which can be orders of magnitude smaller than the physical time. This provides an alternative view on quantum error correction and examples of states whose lifetime of entanglement (between groups of particles) in fact increases with the size of the system.},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\QSPIPDLK\\\\2005_Entanglement properties of multipartite entangled states under the influence ofHein et al_.pdf;C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\CA552AKL\\\\PhysRevA.71.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1653398401797,"version":0},"$loki":9},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":true,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":667,"entry":"@article{horodeckiLimitsEntanglementMeasures2000,\n  title = {Limits for {{Entanglement Measures}}},\n  author = {Horodecki, Michał and Horodecki, Paweł and Horodecki, Ryszard},\n  date = {2000-02-28},\n  journaltitle = {Phys.

For the one-sided channel, the pure states are proved to be the most robust ones, with the aid of the evolution equation for entanglement given by Konrad et al. [Nat. Phys. 4, 99 (2008)]. Based on a generalization of the evolution equation for entanglement, we classify the ansatz states in our investigation by the amount of robustness, and consequently derive the most fragile states. For the two-sided channel, the pure states are the most robust for a fixed concurrence. Under the uniform channel, the most fragile states have the minimal negativity when the concurrence is given in the region [1/2,1]. For a given negativity, the most robust states are the ones with the maximal concurrence, and the most fragile ones are the pure states with minimum of concurrence. When the entanglement approaches zero, the most fragile states under general nonuniform channels tend to the ones in the uniform channel. Influences on robustness by entanglement, degree of mixture, and asymmetry between the two qubits are discussed through numerical calculations. It turns out that the concurrence and negativity are major factors for the robustness. When they are fixed, the impact of the mixedness becomes obvious. In the nonuniform channels, the most fragile states are closely correlated with the asymmetry, while the most robust ones with the degree of mixture.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {Quantum Physics},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\8DMG8I66\\\\2013_Most robust and fragile two-qubit entangled states under depolarizing channelsPang et al_.pdf;C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\EVDA7V3T\\\\1202.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1653398401843,"version":0},"$loki":19},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":true,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":653,"entry":"@article{pataneBoundEntanglementXY2007,\n  title = {Bound Entanglement in the {{XY}} Model},\n  author = {Patanè, D. and Fazio, Rosario and Amico, L.},\n  date = {2007-09},\n  journaltitle = {New J.

We focus on the bipartition entanglement between one qubit and the remaining qubits constituting the system, which is measured by the negativity. For the two-qubit system, the speed for the pure state completely depends on its entanglement. The upper and lower bounds of the speed for arbitrary two-qubit states, and the necessary conditions for a state achieving them, are obtained. For the three-qubit system, we study the speed for pure states, whose entanglement properties can be completely described by five local-unitary-transformation invariants. An analytical expression of the relation between the speed and the invariants is derived. The speed is enhanced by the three-tangle which is the entanglement among the three qubits, but reduced by the two-qubit correlations outside the concurrence. The decay of the negativity can be restrained by the other two negativity with the coequal sense. The unbalance between two qubits can reduce the speed of disentanglement of the remaining qubit in the system, and even can retrieve the entanglement partially. For the k-qubit systems in an arbitrary superposition of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state and W state, the speed depends almost entirely on the amount of the negativity when k increases to five or six. An alternative quantitative definition for the robustness of entanglement is presented based on the speed of disentanglement, with comparison to the widely studied robustness measured by the critical amount of noise parameter where the entanglement vanishes. In the limit of large number of particles, the alternative robustness of the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger-type states is inversely proportional to k, and the one of the W states approaches 1/k.},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Depolarizing channel,Disentanglement,Entanglement invariants,Multiqubit,Robustness},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\CL3G7CDB\\\\2013_Speed of disentanglement in multiqubit systems under a depolarizing channelZhang et al_.pdf;C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\QVVX4VZG\\\\S0003491613000511.html}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1653398401880,"version":0},"$loki":31},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":true,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":9,"entry":"@article{zhaoResidualEffectRobustness2010,\n  title = {Residual Effect on the Robustness of Multiqubit Entanglement},\n  author = {Zhao, Bao-Kui and Deng, Fu-Guo},\n  date = {2010},\n  journaltitle = {Physical Review A},\n  volume = {82},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {014301},\n  publisher = {{APS}},\n  file = {C\\:\\\\Papers\\\\DataDirectory\\\\storage\\\\8KKHD5VE\\\\2010_Residual effect on the robustness of multiqubit entanglementZhao_Deng_.pdf}\n}\n\n","metadata":{"DeclarePrefChars":"","noopsort":false,"packages":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1653398401881,"version":0},"$loki":32},{"exportNotes":false,"useJournalAbbreviation":true,"asciiBibLaTeX":false,"biblatexExtendedNameFormat":false,"DOIandURL":"both","itemID":1,"entry":"@article{zyczkowskiVolumeSetSeparable1998,\n  title = {Volume of the Set of Separable States},\n  author = {Życzkowski, Karol},\n  date = {1998},\n  journaltitle = {Phys.
