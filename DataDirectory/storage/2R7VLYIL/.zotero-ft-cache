Total energy is a functional of the density:

E[⇢] = Ts[{ i[⇢]}] + EH [⇢] + E [⇢] + EZ [⇢] + U [Z]

The density is computed using the one-electron orbitals:

X N ⇢(r) = | i(r)|2

The one-electron orbitals are the solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation:

• Exchange-Correlation functionals are modeled on the uniform-electron-gas (UEG): The correlation energy (and potential) has been calculated by means of MonteCarlo methods for a wide range of densities, and has been parametrized to yield a density functional.
• LDA: we simply pretend that an inhomogeneous electronic density locally behaves like a homogeneous electron gas.
• Many, many, many different functionals available: LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, van-der-Waals functionals, etc etc

An N-electron system: N = O(1023)

Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham DFT takes us a long way:

(r1, ..., rN ) ! { 1(r), 2(r), ..., N (r)}

Nice for atoms and molecules, but in a realistic piece of solid state material N= O(1023)!

Translational invariance: Periodic Boundary Conditions
Translational invariance implies:
nk(r + R) = nk(r)eikR
and
nk(r) = unk(r)eikr
unk(r + R) = unk(r)
All states are labeled by Bloch vector k and the band index n: • The Bloch vector k is usually constrained to lie within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal space lattice.
• The band index n is of the order if the number of electrons per unit cell.

Sampling the 1st BZ

The evaluation of many key quantities involves an integral over the 1st BZ. For instance the charge density:

⇢(r)

=

1 ⌦BZ

XZ
n BZ

fnk|

nk(r)|2dk

We exploit the fact that the orbitals at Bloch vectors k that are close together are almost identical and approximate the integral over the 1st BZ by a weighted sum over a discrete set of k-points:
X ⇢(r) = wkfnk| nk(r)|2dk,
nk

Fazit: the intractable task of determining (r1, ..., rN ) with N=1023, has been reduced to calculating nk(r) at a discrete set of k-points in the 1st BZ, for a
number of bands that is of the order if the number of electrons in the unit cell.

Idea: equally spaced mesh in the 1st Brillouin zone

Example: a quadratic 2D lattice
• q1=q2=4, i.e., 16 points in total • Only 3 symmetry inequivalent points:

Algorithm:
• Calculate equally spaced mesh. • Shift the mesh if desired. • Apply all symmetry operations of the Bravais lattice to all k-points. • Extract the irreducible k-points (IBZ). • Calculate the proper weighting.
Common meshes: Two different choices for the center of the mesh.
• Centered on Γ • Centered around Γ (can break the symmetry!)

Why use plane waves?
• Historical reason: Many elements exhibit a band-structure that can be interpreted in a free electron picture (metallic s and p elements). Pseudopotential theory was initially developed to cope with these elements (pseudopotential perturbation theory).
• Practical reason: The total energy expressions and the Hamiltonian are easy to implement.
• Computational reason: The action of the Hamiltonian on the orbitals can be efficiently evaluated using FFTs.

The Projector-Augmented-Wave method
The number of plane waves needed to describe • tightly bound (spatially strongly localized) states, • and rapid oscillations (nodal features) of the orbitals near the nucleus exceeds any practical limit, except maybe for Li and H.
The common solution: • Introduce the frozen core approximation:
Core electrons are pre-calculated in an atomic environment and kept frozen in the course of the remaining calculations.
• Use of pseudopotentials instead of exact potentials: • Norm-conserving pseudopotentials • Ultra-soft pseudopotentials • The Projector-Augmented-Wave (PAW) method [P. E. Blöchl, Phys. Rev. B 50, 17953 (1994)]

Local operators

To any (semi)-local operator A, that acts on the true all-electron orbital,

the PAW method associates a pseudo operator:
X⇣ A˜ = A + |p˜ii h i|A| ji
ij

⌘ h ˜i|A| ˜ji hp˜j|

that acts on the pseudo-orbital, such that

h |A| i = h e|A˜| ei

For instance the PS operator associated with the density operator (|rihr|)

X⇣

⌘

|rihr| + |p˜ii h i|rihr| ji h ˜i|rihr| ˜ji hp˜j|

and the density

= ⇢e(r) ⇢e1(r) + ⇢1(r)

⌘ h ˜i|rihr| ˜ji hp˜j| ei

Non-local operators are more complicated.

The Hartree energy
• The PS orbitals do not have the same norm as the AE orbitals inside of the PAW spheres.
• To correctly describe the long-range electrostatic interactions between the PAW spheres, a soft compensation charge is introduced in the spheres (like in the FLAPW method):

The Self-Consistency-Cycle (cont.)
Two sub-problems:
• Optimization of { n} Iterative Diagonalization e.g. RMM-DIIS or Blocked Davidson
• Construction of ⇢in Density Mixing e.g. Broyden mixer

The self-Consistency-Cycle

A naïve algorithm: express the Hamilton matrix in a plane wave basis and diagonalize it:

H hG|Hˆ ⇢ |G0i !

H!{

= []

diagonalize

i, ✏i}

i

=

, 1

..,

NFFT

Self-consistency-cycle:
⇢0 ! H0 ! ⇢0 ! ⇢1 = f (⇢0, ⇢0) ! H1 ! ...
Iterate until: ⇢ = ⇢0

BUT: we do not need NFFT eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian (at a cost of O(NFFT3)). Actually we only the Nb lowest eigenstates of H, where Nb is of the order of the number of electrons per unit cell (Nb << NFFT).

Solution: use iterative matrix diagonalization techniques to find the Nb lowest Eigenvector of the Hamiltonian: RMM-DIIS, blocked-Davidson, etc.

Key ingredients: Subspace diagonalization and the Residual

• Rayleigh-Ritz: diagonalization of the Nb x Nb subspace

with

X

X

H¯nmBmk =

✏akppS¯nmBmk

m

m

H¯nm = h n|Hˆ | mi

S¯nm = h n|Sˆ| mi

X
yields Nb eigenvectors | ¯ki = Bmk| mi with eigenvalues εapp.
m

These eigenstates are the best approximation to the exact Nb lowest eigenstates of H within the subspace spanned by the current orbitals.

• The Residual:
|R( n)i = (Hˆ ✏appSˆ)| ni

✏app =

h h

n|Hˆ | n|Sˆ|

ni ni

(its norm is measure for the error in the eigenvector)

Blocked-Davidson

• Take a subset of all bands:

{

n|n = 1, .., N } ) {

1 k

|k

=

1,

..,

n1}

• Extend this subset by adding the (preconditioned) residual vectors to the presently considered subspace:

{ k1/gk1 = K(H

✏appS)

1 k

|k

=

1,

..,

n1}

• Rayleigh-Ritz optimization (“sub-space rotation”) in the 2n1 dimensional subspace to determine the n1 lowest eigenvectors:

diag{

1 k

/gk1

}

{ k2|k = 1, .., n1}

•

Extend subspace with the residuals of

{

2 k

}

{ k1/gk1/gk2 = K(H

✏appS)

2 k

|k

..,

• Rayleigh-Ritz optimization ) { k3|k = 1, .., n1}

• Etc …

• The optimized set replaces the original subset:

{ km|k = 1, .., n1}

{ n|n = 1, .., n1}

•

Continue with next subset:

{

1 k

|k

n1

etc,

…

After treating all bands: Rayleigh-Ritz optimization of { n|n = 1, .., N }
