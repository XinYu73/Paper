Metallic zinc (Zn) has been regarded as an ideal anode material for aqueous batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g–1), low potential (−​0.762 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode), high abundance, low toxicity and intrinsic safety. However, aqueous Zn chemistry persistently suffers from irreversibility issues, as exemplified by its low coulombic efficiency (CE) and dendrite growth during plating/ stripping, and sustained water consumption. In this work, we demonstrate that an aqueous electrolyte based on Zn and lithium salts at high concentrations is a very effective way to address these issues. This unique electrolyte not only enables dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping at nearly 100% CE, but also retains water in the open atmosphere, which makes hermetic cell configurations optional. These merits bring unprecedented flexibility and reversibility to Zn batteries using either LiMn2O4 or O2 cathodes—the former deliver 180 W h kg–1 while retaining 80% capacity for >​ 4,000 cycles, and the latter deliver 300 W h kg–1 (1,000 W h kg–1 based on the cathode) for >​200 cycles.

Since its appearance in the very first battery (Volta Pile, 1799), metallic zinc (Zn) has been regarded as an ideal anode mate-
rial for aqueous batteries because of its high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g–1), low electrochemical potential (−​0.762  V versus (vs) the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), high abundance
and low toxicity, along with an intrinsic safety from their aqueous nature1–4. These advantages directly drove the recent renaissance of rechargeable Zn battery development5–9. However, the
Zn anode in alkaline electrolytes persistently suffers from severe
irreversibility issues caused by the low coulombic efficiency (CE)
of its plating/stripping, dendrite growth during cycling, sustained water consumption10,11 and irreversible by-products, such as Zn
hydroxides or zincates. Although Zn dendrite formation could be minimized in neutral electrolytes1,2, its low plating/stripping
CE remains a severe challenge. In most previous reports, high
charge/discharge rates had to be used to reduce the effect of poor reversibility on cycling life5,6,9,12–14, and regularly replenishing the
electrolyte with water was often required to compensate the water decomposition11,15–17. Zn also had to be used in significant excess
to maintain the supply during its consumption by side reactions,
which leads to substantial underutilization of its theoretical capacity18,19.
The expansion in the electrochemical stability window of aque-
ous electrolytes and other advantages brought about by the recent
discovery of water-in-salt electrolytes provide an unprecedented
opportunity to resolve the irreversibility issue of a Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes20–24, which was found to be closely associated with the solvation-sheath structure of the divalent cation10,25–29. The strong interaction between Zn2+ and water molecules constitutes a high energy barrier for a solvated Zn2+ to desolvate and deposit, whereas the generation of a hydroxyl ion (OH−) via water
decomposition often drives the formation of Zn(OH)2, which further converts into insoluble ZnO and becomes electrochemically inactive11,30. Strongly bound zincate complexes also promote dendrite formation1.

Here we report that the highly concentrated Zn-ion electrolyte (denoted as HCZE hereafter) with a supporting salt at a high concentration, 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​2  0 m LiTFSI (where m is molality (mol kg–1); TFSI, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide)24, which is neutral in pH and capable of retaining water in an open atmosphere, promotes dendrite-free plating/stripping of Zn at nearly 100% CE, and brings unprecedented reversibility to aqueous Zn batteries with either LiMn2O4 or O2 cathodes. The former delivers 180 W h kg–1 and retains 80% of its capacity for >4​ ,000 cycles, whereas the latter delivers 300 W h kg–1 for >​200 cycles. The structural and spectroscopic studies combined with molecular-scale modelling revealed that this excellent Zn reversibility stems from the unique solvationsheath structure of Zn2+ in the highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte, where the high population of anions forces them into the vicinity of Zn2+ to form close ion pairs (Zn–TFSI)+ that significantly suppress the presence of (Zn–(H2O)6)2+. This fundamental understanding opens up a new avenue to the highly efficient utilization of Zn for advanced energy-storage applications with intrinsic safety, and with potential application for other multivalent cations that are often plagued with poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics.
High Zn reversibility
The reversibility and stability of Zn in HCZE (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 20 m LiTFSI) were investigated using a Zn/Zn symmetric cell under galvanostatic condition (Fig. 1a). After >​500 cycles (which takes >​ 170 hours), the Zn plated on the substrates still exhibits a dense and dendrite-free morphology (Fig. 1b), which contains no ZnO according to X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1b, inset). In sharp contrast, in an alkaline electrolyte (6 M KOH), a sudden polarization occurs after only six stripping/plating cycles (Supplementary Fig. 1a) due to intensified Zn-dendrite formation, which shorted the cell within 5.3 hours. Consistent with the previous reports, the formation of a ZnO layer was detected by XRD on this cycled Zn surface (Supplementary Fig. 1b)2. The reversibility of Zn plating/stripping in HCZE was further investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV),

in which a Pt disk (2 mm in diameter) was used as the working and Zn as the reference and counter electrodes in a three-electrode cell. Chronocoulometry curves (Fig. 1c, inset) reveal that the plating/ stripping is highly reversible with the CE approaching 100% after the second cycle, which is similar to that of the ionic liquid-based electrolytes25,28. Again, in sharp contrast, the CE in alkaline electrolytes is <​50% (Supplementary Fig. 2) under identical conditions. Alternatively, in mildly acidic aqueous electrolytes (2 M ZnSO4 and 2 M Zn(CH3COO)2), higher CEs of 75% and 80%, respectively, were obtained (Supplementary Fig. 2), but still much inferior when compared to HCZE. Pt/Zn coin cells were also used to evaluate the reversibility of Zn plating/stripping, whose CE, calculated from the ratio of Zn removed from Pt substrate to that deposited during the same cycle, gradually increased and reached 99.5% after the first three cycles (Supplementary Fig. 3). Remarkably, a stable CE of >​ 99.7% was maintained for >​200 cycles, which suggests that essentially all the Zn deposited on the substrate could be recovered during the subsequent stripping process. Interestingly, CEs were found to be highly sensitive to LiTFSI concentrations in HCZE, where they steadily increased from ~80% at 5 m LiTFSI to ~96% at 15 m LiTFSI (Supplementary Fig. 4). Apparently, the high TFSI concentration, which amounts to 22 m (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​2  0 m LiTFSI), could be directly responsible for the high CE of Zn in HCZE.
Solvation-sheath structure of Zn2+ In aqueous solutions, Zn2+ cations are solvated by dipolar water molecules, which gives rise to aqua ions (Zn(OH2)6)2+ as long as

there are enough water molecules available. Such cation–solvent
interaction has a profound effect on the pH of the resultant solutions because, for the solvated Zn2+, charge transfer occurs via the
M–OH2 bond, with electrons departing the 3a1 bonding molecular orbital of the coordinated water for empty Zn2+ orbitals, which
results in a significantly weakened O–H bond within the water molecule31,32. In dilute aqueous solutions, deprotonation would ensue
and generate an acidic solution along with a series of more-or-less
deprotonated monomeric species, which range from aqua ions (Zn(OH2)6)2+ to hydroxyl species Zn(OH)2 or even oxo-anions ZnO when all the protons are removed from the coordination sphere of the metal cation33. As shown in Fig. 2a, the electrolyte pH values
steadily increase with LiTFSI concentration, from pH =​ 3 at 1.0 m Zn(TFSI)2, where the strong interaction of Zn2+ with H2O leads to hydrolysis34, all the way to approaching pH ≈​ 7 in HCZE, where the near neutrality indicates the effective suppression of hydrolysis. The interplay among Zn2+, TFSI− and water was quantified using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopies. A strong band in the FTIR spectra at ~3,552 cm−1 (Fig. 2b) together with a small shoulder at ~3,414 cm−1 arise for the dilute concentration (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​5   m LiTFSI), with the peak at 3,414 cm−1 attributed to the weak hydrogen bonding of H2O, which indicates the aggregation of water molecules35. At a salt concentration of 10 m, the 3,414 cm−1
peak almost disappears, which indicates the extensive disruption of the water network connected via hydrogen bonding. The 17O chem-
ical shift of the water signal (~0 ppm) in the NMR spectra (Fig. 2c)
serves as a sensitive indicator for its coordination with salt ions.

Fig. 2 | The effect of LiTFSI concentration on the cation solvation-sheath structure and bulk properties. a, The pH values of the electrolytes with varying LiTFSI concentrations. b, The progression of FTIR spectra with salt concentration between 3,800 and 3,100 cm−1. c, The change with salt concentration of chemical shifts for 17O nuclei in solvent (water). d, The weight retention of different electrolytes in the air with a relative humidity of ~65%.

With increasing salt concentration, the 17O signal starts a downshift, because the lone-pair electrons on water O are directly depleted by the Li+ cation, which deshields the O nucleus. This effect apparently intensifies as the salt concentration increases to ~10 m. Based on both the FTIR and 17O-NMR spectra, we believe that, at high Li+ concentrations, water molecules may have been severely confined within the Li+ solvation structures, and the presence of water in the vicinity of Zn2+ severely diminished. This weakened Zn–water interaction essentially eliminated the hydrolysis effect, as evidenced by the neutral pH value.
Figure 2d demonstrates the weight retention of the electrolytes with varying LiTFSI concentrations when exposed to the open atmosphere. A sharp contrast exists between the dilute (5 m LiTFSI) and the concentrated (10 m LiTFSI and greater) electrolytes. The most concentrated electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 20 m LiTFSI) not only retains the water content for 40 days, but also experiences a slight weight increase, which indicates that the electrolyte actually extracted moisture from the ambient. This unique feature effectively removes the traditional concern of aqueous Zn electrolytes that regularly require replenishing, and renders the cell with unprecedented flexibility in form factor and durability.
Molecular dynamics (MD) studies
MD simulations were performed using the polarizable APPLE&P force field on aqueous electrolytes that consisted of 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 and LiTFSI at three concentrations (5 m, 10 m and 20 m) as a function of temperature. The force field’s ability to describe Zn2+ binding to TFSI− is shown in Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 and Table 1. Due to the much stronger binding of water and TFSI− by Zn2+ as compared to Li+, a longer residence time of TFSI in the vicinity of Zn2+ was observed as compared to the Li+/TFSI− relaxation. Thus,

a sequence of MD simulation runs from 450 K (overheated sys-
tem) to 393 K and 363 K was performed to accelerate the dynamics and to ensure that the equilibrium Zn2+-solvation-sheath
structure was obtained (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7). Due to
the higher thermal fluctuations at these temperatures (393 K and 450 K), Zn2+ relaxation is significantly faster, and the resultant Zn2+-solvation-sheath structures adequately converge. In the most dilute electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 5 m LiTFSI), Zn2+ is expected to coordinate with six water molecules without much contribution
from the TFSI, as shown in Fig. 3b–d and Supplementary Fig. 7.
This finding is in accord with density functional theory (DFT)
calculations (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 2
and 3) performed on the Zn(TFSI)m(H2O)n clusters immersed in an implicit water solvent, which revealed the preference of Zn2+ to coordinate water instead of TFSI− in dilute solutions. At the
intermediate LiTFSI concentration (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 10 m LiTFSI (Fig. 3b–d), anions start to occupy the Zn2+-solvation sheath,
which results in a temperature-dependent composition of the Zn2+-solvation shell. In other words, for the electrolytes of inter-
mediate concentrations, increasing temperatures favour the for-
mation of cation–anion aggregates that could be beneficial for
anion reduction rather than water. In the most concentrated electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 20 m LiTFSI), the Zn2+-solvation sheath is occupied primarily by TFSI, with six coordinating oxygens all
from TFSI (Fig. 3b–d and Supplementary Fig. 7). Small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were performed to val-
idate the intermediate-range electrolyte structures predicted by
MD simulations, which confirmed the position and shape of an I(Q) peak at Q ≈​ 0.5 A−1 (Fig. 3e), which originates largely from the D2O–D2O correlations with a minor contribution from the ion–ion interaction36.

DFT calculations also predicted that Zn(TFSI)2(H2O)2 clusters found in the 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​1 0 m LiTFSI electrolyte undergo reduction at around 2.55 V vs Li/Li+, which results in H2 evolution (Supplementary Fig. 9). TFSI reduction in such clusters would occur at lower potentials (1.6~2.1 V vs Li/Li+), which indicates that H2 evolution is expected to be the predominant reaction as long as water molecules are present in the Zn2+-solvation sheath. In the concentrated electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 20 m LiTFSI), however, water is no longer present in the Zn2+-solvation sheath, and consequently the reduction potential of the Zn(TFSI)n solvate is increased. Note that the defluorination reaction of LiTFSI occurs at a potential above that of H2 evolution at high TFSI concentrations23. This crossover is critically meaningful for the formation of an effective interphase, whose presence prevents hydrogen evolution at a lower potential and enables an almost quantitative plating/stripping chemistry (CE ≈​ 100%) of Zn.
Aqueous Zn/LiMn2O4 hybrid battery To demonstrate the reversibility of the Zn anode in an actual full battery, LiMn2O4 was used as the cathode to couple with Zn in HCZE and form a hybrid battery in which the well-established Li+ intercalation–deintercalation happens at LiMn2O4 in a highly reversible manner, whereas Zn strips/plates at the Zn anode. Thus, the CE of Zn stripping/plating dictates the overall electrochemical reversibility of this hybrid chemistry. Unlike the frequent practice of Zn batteries, wherein excessive Zn metal has to be used to prevent premature depletion, the mass ratio between Zn and LiMn2O4 was set to 0.8:1 in this work to leverage the high Zn stripping/plating CE. Figure 4a shows the charge/discharge profiles of this hybrid battery at a 0.2 C rate, consistent with the typical LiMn2O4 charge/ discharge profiles. The capacity calculated based on the (cathode +​ anode) mass is 66 mA h g–1, which corresponds to an energy density of 119 W h kg–1. By further reducing the Zn:LiMn2O4 mass ratio to 0.25:1, a higher energy density of 180 W h kg–1 was achieved (Supplementary Fig. 10).
The Zn/LiMn2O4 full-cell functions with both a high cycling stability and a high columbic efficiency at low (0.2 C) and high (4 C) rates (Fig. 4b,c). At 0.2 C, an excellent stability with a high capacity retention of 83.8% and a CE of 99.9% for 500 cycles was observed;

at 4 C, 85% of the initial capacity could still be retained after 4,000
cycles, with a high CE of 99.9%. The effect of LiTFSI concentration
on the electrochemical performance of Zn/LiMn2O4 cells was also investigated (Supplementary Fig. 11). The mass ratio of Zn:LiMn2O4 was again set at 0.8:1. For the intermediate LiTFSI concentration (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​1  5 m LiTFSI), the capacity retention after 100 cycles was 75%, along with an average CE of ~99%, whereas at the lower LiTFSI concentration (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 10 m LiTFSI) the capacity retention dropped to 59.5% after 100 cycles with the aver-
age CE of ~97%. In sharp contrast, the cell using the dilute electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 5 m LiTFSI) showed a rather low CE of ~90% during the first 20 cycles, and the capacity rapidly decayed to zero
after only 25 cycles. The low CE, rather than Zn-dendrite forma-
tion, is considered responsible for the limited cycle number in this
case, as no short circuit was observed. Theoretically, a nearly 100%
CE is required to achieve the long-term cycling stability of zinc batteries37,38, otherwise excessive Zn metal has to be used to com-
pensate for the incessant Zn consumption, which drives down the
actual specific-capacity utilization and energy density. The parasitic
reactions in Zn/LiMn2O4 were evaluated by monitoring the opencircuit-voltage decay of a fully charged cell during storage and then
discharging after 24 hours of storage. 97.8% of the original capacity
was retained (Fig. 4d), which confirms that the parasitic H2 and O2 evolutions during storage remain negligible.
Finally, we attempted to estimate the full-cell energy density
on a more practical basis by also including the electrolyte weight.
It was found that because the above 'Zn–Li' hybrid battery is at a
discharged state upon assembly, its energy density relies on how much Zn2+ is prestored in the pristine electrolyte, which is limited
by the Zn salt solubility. Thus, the full-cell energy density decreases
to an unsatisfactory level if all the Zn has to be present in the pris-
tine electrolytes. To mitigate this disadvantage, we circumvented the
above limitation by assembling the cell in its charged state, that is,
coupling a MnO2 cathode with a Zn anode. In this configuration, Zn is stored at the anode, whereas an electrolyte with a low Zn salt concentration (0.2 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​2  1 m LiTFSI) was used. When such a Zn/MnO2 cell experiences the initial discharge, Zn2+ dissolves from the anode and gradually displaces Li+ in the electrolyte, whereas Li+ leaves the electrolyte and intercalates into the MnO2

lattice. Benefitting from the high CE of both Zn stripping/plating and Li+ intercalation/de-intercalation, the overall cell reversibility is almost identical to that of the discharged full-cell Zn/LiMn2O4 (Supplementary Fig. 12), but the energy density could now reach a high level of 70 W h kg–1 based on the total weight of the anode, cathode and electrolyte.
Highly reversible aqueous Zn/O2 battery To demonstrate the versatility of HCZE, a Zn/O2 battery was assembled using Zn as the anode and a porous carbon substrate as the air cathode. Such a chemistry promises an attractive theoretical energy density and has been considered a preferable candidate for large-scale energy-storage applications. Although primary Zn–air batteries have been well developed, their rechargeability has always been hindered by poor Zn reversibility as well as by inefficient air cathodes, in which the cell reactions must occur at triphase sites. Previous efforts at rechargeable Zn/O2 systems mainly focused on developing bifunctional catalysts for the air cathode16,39–43, with limited attention given to electrolytes44,45. Commonly used alkaline electrolytes are known to induce poor Zn reversibility and cause significant passivation on the air cathode, mainly due to the presence of atmospheric CO2. However, the neutral pH of HCZE simultaneously stabilizes Zn and the air cathode. Thus, a Zn/O2 cell with a porous air cathode constructed on carbon paper was examined in the full range between 0.5 and 2.0 V at 50 mA g–1. Here the specific capacity and the current density are based on the active materials of O2 electrodes because the carbon paper is inactive (Supplementary Fig. 13). Such a cell delivers a highly reversible capacity of nearly 3,000 mA h g–1 at an average discharge potential of 0.9 V (Fig. 5a), which, along with the 1.9 V charge potential, is superior to most Zn–air batteries reported in alkaline electrolytes. Unlike alkaline electrolytes, in which the formation of zincate ions (Zn(OH)42−)

prevails, instead ZnO was formed after the first discharge process,
as confirmed by the Raman spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 14).
The cell voltage fluctuates when the cell is deep discharged, which
is believed to be induced by resistance hiking and the subsequent
change in the oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. This could be
caused by the overproduction of an insulating species, ZnO, on the porous air cathode. To clarify whether Li+ or Zn2+ participates in the
reaction with the air cathode, a blank experiment was conducted
using excess LiFePO4 to couple with the same air electrode in a Zn-ion-free electrolyte (21 m LiTFSI electrolyte). This cell showed a
much lower capacity, lower CE, higher overpotential and extremely
slow kinetics (Supplementary Fig. 15). Thus, we conclude that the Zn2+ reaction with O2 at the air cathode dominates the cell chemistry with a reaction mechanism actually similar to that of Li/O2 or other metal–air chemistries that employ either non-aqueous or ionic liquid electrolytes44,46. Given that no catalyst was used in the
above Zn/O2 cell, further improvements in the round-trip energy efficiency are very likely if proper bifunctional catalysts or redox
mediators are adopted.
The capacity of the Zn/O2 cell remained stable for ten cycles and then slowly decayed to 1,000 mA h g–1 in 40 cycles, which should
be caused by the degradation of the O2 cathode (Supplementary Fig. 16). The cell was also cycled under a constant-capacity mode of 1,000 mA h g–1 (Fig. 5b), which corresponds to a full-cell energy density of 300 W h kg–1 (based on the cathode and anode, or 160 W h kg–1 with the electrolyte weight included). Limiting the
capacity utilization allows the cycle life to be extended beyond 200
cycles, with the polarization slightly increasing with cycle number.
Apparently, the concentrated and neutral HCZE, with its unique
water-retaining capability, enables a Zn/O2 cell with an excellent cycle life, high efficiency and good capacity utilization not observed
in any conventional Zn aqueous electrolytes known thus far.

Conclusions
The highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte (1 m Zn(TFSI)2 +​ 20 m LiTFSI) enables a wide variety of unique properties that are otherwise unavailable from dilute Zn electrolytes. The MD simulations and structural and spectroscopic studies establish a direct correlation between the Zn2+-solvation-sheath structure and Zn anode reversibility. At LiTFSI concentrations ≥​20 m, in which Zn2+ is surrounded by TFSI− instead of water, H2 evolution is effectively prevented, which leads to a reversible and dendrite-free Zn plating/ stripping (CE ≈​1  00%). Leveraging this high reversibility, a few Zn batteries were demonstrated, all of which outperform their counterparts in dilute aqueous Zn electrolytes. The hybrid Zn–Li battery (Zn/LiMn2O4) delivers an excellent cycle performance, with an 85% capacity retained after 4,000 cycles at a CE of 99.9%. The more challenging Zn/O2 system delivers an unprecedented high energy density of 300 W h kg–1 for 200 cycles. In particular, the neutral pH and excellent water-retention capability of this new Zn aqueous electrolyte significantly benefits the application of a Zn/air battery, which has been plagued by the alkaline nature of the electrolytes and their tendency to lose water via both parasitic reactions and evaporation. The intrinsic safety and excellent cyclability makes these Zn batteries potential candidates for the application in some extreme conditions, such as in aerospace, airplanes, submarines, deep-ocean survey vehicles and other military applications. Inspired by this concept, an alternative electrolyte (0.5 m zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) +​ 18 m NaClO4) provides an excellent CE of ~98% at a much lower cost (Supplementary Fig. 17). The fundamental understanding and the above demonstrations of successful

batteries open a viable route to the development of Zn batteries with high energy, high reversibility and high safety, which could also be extended to other multivalent cations.

Methods
Materials. LiN(SO2CF3)2 (LiTFSI), Zn(N(SO2CF3)2)2 (Zn(TFSI)2) and Zn(CF3SO3)2 were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. The electrolyte (20 m LiTFSI +​ 1 m Zn(TFSI)2) was prepared by dissolving LiTFSI and Zn(TFSI)2 in water according to the molality (20 mol LiTFSI and 1 mol Zn(TFSI)2 in 1 kg water). Zinc foil (0.1 mm thick) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Zinc powder (40–60 nm) and NaClO4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and LiMn2O4 were purchased from MTI Corporation. Carbon paper was purchased from FuelCellStore. (Certain commercial equipment, instruments and materials are identified in this paper to foster understanding. Such identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), nor does it imply that the materials or equipment mentioned are necessarily the best available for the purpose).
Materials characterizations. The morphology of the sample was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU-70). All the samples for ex situ SEM were recovered from a full aqueous battery in a 2032 coin-cell configuration after electrochemical cycling. XRD patterns were obtained on a Bruker Smart 1000 (Bruker AXS, Inc.) using Cu Kα​radiation with an airtight holder from Bruker. FTIR was performed with a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer instrument and a Golden Gate single-reflection monolithic diamond attenuated total reflection sample cell. The 17O NMR experiments were done with a 400 SB Bruker Avance III spectrometer, using 5 mm tubes.
Electrochemical measurements. The zinc anode was prepared by mixing 80% zinc powder, 10% carbon black and 10% PVDF in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and the slurry mixture was then coated on Al foil. The LiMn2O4 cathode was prepared by compressing active material, carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) at weight ratio of 8:1:1 onto the stainless steel mesh. The O2 cathode was prepared by mixing 70% carbon black and 30% PVDF in NMP and the slurry mixture was then coated on carbon paper. After coating, the electrodes were dried at 80 °C for 10 min to remove the solvent before pressing. The electrodes were cut into 1 cm2 sheets, vacuum dried at 100 °C for 24 h and weighed before assembly. CV was carried out using a CHI 600E electrochemical work station. The charge–discharge experiments were performed on a Land BT2000 battery test system (Wuhan) at room temperature.
SANS measurements. SANS measurements were performed at the NIST Center for Neutron Research at NIST on the 30 m SANS instrument located on neutron guide 7 (ref. 47). Samples were contained in standard titanium demountable cells with quartz windows and a 1 mm path length. During the experiment the samples were kept at 30 °C using a thermal bath, which allows for a temperature control better than ±​0.1°C. The incoming neutron wavelength λ was 5 Å with a Δ​λ/λ =​  14%. The raw scattering data were corrected for background, empty cell and sample transmission to obtain one-dimensional scattering patterns as a function of the exchanged wavevector Q = ​ 4π​/λsin(θ/2) (θ being the scattering angle)48. Throughout this manuscript uncertainties and error bars represent one standard error.
DFT study of Zn coordination. The Zn2+ cation competitive solvation by water and TFSI− anions was investigated using DFT. Calculations were performed on

the Zn(TFSI)m and Zn(H2O)n clusters in the gas phase and in an implicit solvent using the solvation model based on density (SMD) developed by the Truhlar group49. The built-in SMD parameters for water in g09 Gaussian software were used with ε = ​ 78.3553 (ref. 49). Gaussian 09 (revision c) software was used for all the quantum chemistry calculations. A pruned (99,590) ultrafine integration grid was used, which corresponded to the int =​ UltraFine keyword. Based on the previous benchmark calculations of the Zn-coordinated complexes, the M05-2 ×​ DFT functional was chosen because it was demonstrated to yield accurate geometric parameters, dipole moments and bond-dissociation energies for Zn centres50.
MD studies. MD simulations were performed on aqueous electrolytes doped with 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 and three concentrations of LiTFSI salts, 5 m, 10 m and 20 m, as a function of temperature. The simulation cell contained nine Zn(TFSI)2, 92 LiTFSI and 1,024 water for the 5 m LiTFSI +​ 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 electrolyte, 18 Zn(TFSI)2, 184 LiTFSI and 1,024 water for the 10 m LiTFSI +​ 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 electrolyte and nine Zn(TFSI)2, 174 LiTFSI and 484 water for the 20 m LiTFSI +​ 1 m Zn(TFSI)2 electrolyte. The previously developed many-body polarizable force field (APPLE&P) was used for the LiTFSI and H2O terms24.
The Ewald summation method was used in MD simulations for the electrostatic interactions between permanent charges with permanent charges and permanent charges with induced dipole moments with k =​  73 vectors. Multiple timestep integration was employed with an inner timestep of 0.5 fs (bonded interactions), a central time step of 1.5 fs for all non-bonded interactions within a truncation distance of 7.0–8.0 Å and an outer timestep of 3.0 fs for all non-bonded interactions between 7.0 Å and the non-bonded truncation distance of of 19 Å. The reciprocal part of Ewald was updated only at the largest of the multiple timesteps. A Nose–Hoover thermostat and a barostat were used to control the temperature and pressure with the associated frequencies of 10−2 and 0.1 × ​ 10−4 fs. The stress tensor was saved every 9 fs to calculate stress, the tensor autocorrelation function and viscosity, and the atomic coordinates were saved every 2 ps for post-analysis.
