Abstract

The effects of chemical and hydrostatic pressures on structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of R 2 NiMn O 6 double perovskites, with R being a rare-earth ion, have been systematically studied by using specific first-principles calculations. These latter reproduce well the correlation between several properties (e.g., lattice parameters, Ni-O-Mn bond angles, magnetic Curie temperature, and electronic band gap) and the rare-earth ionic radius (i.e., the chemical pressure). They also provide novel predictions awaiting experimental confirmation, such as (i) that many physical quantities respond in dramatically different manners to chemical versus hydrostatic pressure, unlike as commonly thought for perovskites containing rare-earth ions, and (ii) a dependence of antipolar displacements on chemical and hydrostatic pressures, which would further explain why the recently predicted electrical polarization of L a 2 NiMn O 6 / R 2 NiMn O 6 superlattices [H. J. Zhao, W. Ren, Y. Yang, J. Íñiguez, X. M. Chen, and L. Bellaiche, Nat. Commun . 5 , 4021 (2014) ] can be created and controlled by playing with the rare-earth element.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

    Structural properties of double perovskite oxides as a function of chemical pressure (i.e., the rare-earth ionic radius, ). (a) Lattice parameters and monoclinic angle ; (b) Ni-O and Mn-O bond lengths; (c) the average antiphase tilting (about the pseudocubic [100] or [010] direction), in-phase tilting (about the pseudocubic [001] direction), and in-plane and out-of-plane Ni-O-Mn bond angles; (d) antipolar displacement of the ions. Panels (e) and (f) schematize the patterns associated with the antipolar displacements discussed in the text, with the pseudocubic [100], [010], and [001] directions also indicated there. The light blue and purple colors are used to represent and octahedrons, respectively. The AFE displacements associated with the point (e) and point (f) of the cubic first Brillouin zone are along the pseudocubic direction (which is the axis) and pseudocubic [110] direction (which is the axis), respectively.

    Calculated DOS of (0 kbar, top panel), (0 kbar, middle panel), and (110 kbar, bottom panel), respectively. The total DOS are shown by means of black lines, while the contribution of Ni and Mn bands are represented via green and purple lines, respectively. For each panel, the upper part shows the spin-up channel, and the bottom part depicts the results for the spin-down channel.
