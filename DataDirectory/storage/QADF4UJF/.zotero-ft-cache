Supplementary Discussion I – Deﬁnition of the q points and their modulations

In 5-atom cubic perovskites with lattice vectors a, b and c and reciprocal lattice vectors a∗, b∗ and c∗, we deﬁne the q

points and corresponding modulations in Supplementary Table I. By modulation associated with q = qxa∗+qyb∗+qzc∗

(referred to as q = (qx, qy, qz)), we mean that for a given physical quantity (e.g., a vector V), its component on the (l, m, n) site (deﬁned by Rlmn = la + mb + nc) is equal to Vlmn = Ve2πi(lqx+mqy+nqz). In Supplementary Fig. 1,

we show the ABO3 perovskites with the anti-phase and in-phase BO6 tiltings about the z-axis (panels (b) and (c)). Practically, the anti-phase tiltings can be along the x, y or z direction, termed as ωxR, ωyR, and ωzR, respectively. Note
that, the anti-phase tiltings have only one type of modulation, which is associated with the R point (note that the

deﬁning equality of this point is given in Supplementary Table I). In contrast, the in-phase tiltings can be modulated

with respect to Mx, My, or Mz points (these points are also deﬁned in Supplementary Table I); once the Mα point is

chosen, the axis of the in-phase tilting has to be along α as well. In other words, the in-phase tiltings only includes

three types, with the symbols ωxMx , ωyMy , and ωzMz , respectively. The ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric symmetrized

lattices. Here, d = A or B indicates that the motion is within A or B sublattice; K or K denote the K point

modulation (see, e.g., Γ, R, Mx, Xy points in Supplementary Table I); the α is the direction for such motions (i.e.,

x, y, or z orientations). Note that the Mβ modulated anti-ferroelectric motions can be oriented along the α direction

(i.e., α does not have to be equal to β, which is unlike the case for in-phase tilting). Such fact is also valid for the Xβ

modulation.

Supplementary Figure 1. The perovskites ABO3 whose BO6 octahedra is not tilted (panel (a)), tilted with anti-phase ωzR (panel (b)), and tilted with in-phase ωzMz (panel (c)). In panel (d), we show a sketch for a physical quantity (e.g., vector V along the z direction) on A or B sublattices with Mz modulation. Note that the purple (along the +z direction) and green (along −z direction) arrows are centered on the sites with “+” and “-” signs sketched in Supplementary Table I for q=(1/2, 1/2, 0), respectively. If the arrows represent the tiltings on B sublattice, panel (d) will denote the in-phase tilting (ωzMz ). Furthermore, the arrows can also represent the anti-ferroelectrics on A (respectively, B) sublattice, and panel (d) will then be linked with the symbols AM z z (respectively, BzMz ).

Supplementary Discussion III – Non-collinear ferroelectricity in P mc21 BiFeO3 and P na21 BiInO3
Let us ﬁrst indicate that we also found six additional couplings in the form of αβγ αβγωαQ1,βQ2,β (with α being diﬀerent from β, along with α and β being x, y or z), which are by-products when searching for the terms listed in Table I of the main text. These mechanisms (summarized in Supplementary Table II) result in collinear ferroelectricity or anti-ferroelectricity when considering a single of such terms (i.e., the motions Q1 and Q2 are both along the same single direction in Cartesian coordinate system). In contrast, when Q1 and Q2 are along multiple directions (e.g., (Q1,x, Q1,y) or (Q2,x, −Q2,y)), non-collinear ferroelectricity or anti-ferroelectricity can be obtained when considering several of these terms. Let us take the E14 mechanism as an example, assuming that the in-phase tiltings are along the z direction (ωzMz ), and the Γ-point ferroelectric motions are along x + y direction (AΓx and AΓy ). As a result, E14 automatically generates AM x z and −AM y z . Consequently, the E14 mechanism can result in non-collinear motions (see Supplementary Fig. 3). The reason why we mention such fact here is that it plays an important role to interpret the non-collinear motions of A cations in the P mc21 phase of e.g., BiFeO3 [1].
The detailed structural analysis for strained BiFeO3 within P mc21 was done by Yang et al. [1]. We simply repeat the main results of Ref. [1] here: for both Bi and Fe ions, there are ferroelectric motions along the pseudo-cubic [110] direction (Supplementary Fig. 4(a)) and anti-ferroelectric motions along the pseudo-cubic [-110] direction associated with Mz point (z is along the pseudo-cubic [001] direction) (Supplementary Fig. 4(b)); the combination of ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric motions renders non-collinear ferroelectric displacements for both Bi and Fe ions with “zigzag” pattern (Supplementary Fig. 4(c)) [1].
Regarding the P na21 state BiInO3 [2], a reﬁned analysis clearly shows that In1, In2, In3 and In4 ions have the displacement vectors (i.e., dIn deﬁned in Supplementary Fig. 4(e)) of (0.045, 0.006, 0), (0.045, -0.006, 0), (-0.045, 0.006, 0), and (-0.045, -0.006, 0) ˚A, respectively. Note that the (dx, dy, dz) motions are expressed in the basis deﬁned by the pseudo-cubic [110], [-110], and [001] directions, respectively. In other words, along the pseudo-cubic [-110] direction, there is a R−point modulated anti-ferroelectric motions (with a magnitude of 0.006 ˚A) for In ions; along the pseudo-cubic [110] direction, the anti-ferroelectric displacements (with the magnitude of 0.045 ˚A) of In is associated to the Xz point. Similarly, we can obtain the motions of Bi ions with respect to the “average” position of

compared to InO6 octahedral. We then identify three type of motions for Bi sublattice: ferroelectric motion of -0.45 ˚A along pseudo-cubic [001] direction (i.e., BiΓz ), anti-ferroelectric motion of 0.19 ˚A along pseudo-cubic [110] direction (i.e. BiXx z and BiXy z ), and another anti-ferroelectric motion of 0.05 ˚A along pseudo-cubic [-110] direction (i.e., -BiRx and BiRy ). The combination of R−point modulated anti-ferroelectric motions for In and Γ−point ferroelectric motions for Bi forms non-collinear ferroelectricity of BiInO3, as interpreted by our E7 term in Table I of the main text.
Finally, there are three types of motions in BiInO3 that can not be explained by our terms in Table I. The ﬁrst type is the Xz-point modulated motions for Bi ions (i.e. BiXx z and BiXy z ), which, in fact, originates from the trilinear coupling involving two tiltings rather than a single one (ωxRyωzMz AXxyz , A =Bi) [3, 4] where ωxRy, ωzMz , and AXxyz are InO6’s anti-phase tilting along xy-direction (i.e., pseudo-cubic [110], see Supplementary Fig. 4(f)), InO6’s in-phase tilting along z-direction, and Bi’s anti-ferroelectric motions (Xz point) along xy-direciton. The second type is the R-point modulated motions for Bi ions (i.e., -BiRx and BiRy ) which is explained by (ωxRyωzMz ωzMz ARx¯y, A =Bi) [3, 4]. Note that ωxRyωzMz AXxyz and ωxRyωzMz ωzMz ARx¯y are closely related to the BO6 octahedral-induced hybrid improper ferroelectricity in A BO3/A BO3 superlattices [5–9]. The third type is the Xz-point modulated motions for In ions (i.e., 0.045 ˚A along pseudo-cubic [110]) which is interpreted by a four-term coupling ωxRyωzMz BxXyz AΓz (B=In, A=Bi). All these anti-ferroelectric motions of the Bi ions, combined with their ferroelectric motions, result in non-collinear
ferroelectricity as well – indicating other interesting non-collinear-ferroelectric mechanisms that go beyond the trilinear
couplings revealed in the main text (such other mechanisms may be studied in other works).

Panel (f) shows the positions of In and Bi ions in P na21 crystallographic coordinate system (e.g., the [110], [-110], and [001] directions) and in pseudo-cubic coordinate system (e.g., the xyz− Cartesian coordinate system.)

Supplementary Discussion IV – The nearest neighbor D vectors We now aim at extracting the underlying electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vector based on the
twelve mechanisms summarized in Table I of the main text. In the present work, we highlight the nearest neighbor DMI for B − B, A − A, and A − B pairs (sketched in Supplementary Fig. 5), involving in-phase or anti-phase tilting. For that, let us start from, e.g.,

perovskite ABO3, marked by D (Bi, Bj), D (Ai, Aj), and D (Ai, Bk), respectively. When saying D (Bi, Bj), D (Ai, Aj), and D (Ai, Bk), we are really meaning that the corresponding D vectors are functions of rBi − rBj , rAi − rAj , and rAi − rBk , respectively. Here vector r denote the position vectors for A or B ions. For the DMI for nearest neighbor A − A or B − B pairs, the direction of rBi − rBj or rAi − rAj vectors, which is α in the left panel, can only be one of x, y, or z. Right panel: an explicit example showing the DMI for the nearest neighbor Bi − Bj pairs with rBi − rBj along x direction. Note that, the i index is short for (ix, iy, iz) with e.g., iy denotes the index for i site along y direction. Following such convention, there are eight nearest neighbor Ai − Bk DMI, with k being i + (0, 0, 0), i + (1, 0, 0), i + (0, 1, 0), i + (0, 0, 1), i + (1, 1, 0), i + (1, 0, 1), i + (0, 1, 1), and i + (1, 1, 1), marked in the
right panel. The unmarked Bi and Bj are recognized as i + (0, 0, 0), and i + (1, 0, 0), respectively.

Now the calculation process is done within a big supercell containing N 5-atom cells. We focus on the nearest
neighbor DMI for B − B pair with one B ion located at i ≡ (ix, iy, iz) site. Therefore the BβR, and BγΓ can be written in the following way:

In such supercell, one can deﬁne three nearest neighbor DMI vectors, i.e., D (x) ≡ D i,i+(1,0,0), D (y) ≡ D i,i+(0,1,0), and D (z) ≡ D i,i+(0,0,1), denoting the DMI for B − B pairs along the x, y, and z directions, respectively. The z component of the D (x) vector is given by Eq. S4 where δ(jx,jy,jz),(ix,iy,iz) = δjx,ix δjy,iy δjz,iz .

We also have D (χ)α ∝ 2(−1)ix+iy+iz ωαR with χ and α being x, y or z. Using a similar strategy, we have obtained the DMI for the nearest neighbor B − B (extracted from E1 to E6 mechanisms) and B − A (extracted from E7 to E12 mechanisms) pairs, summarized in Supplementary Tables III, IV, V, and VI respectively. The DMIs for B − B and A − B pairs are all driven by the anti-phase or in-phase tiltings of BO6 octahedra. Given anti-phase tiltings along the χ direction (e.g., ωχR, χ = x, y, z), the DMI can be classiﬁed into longitudinal (e.g., D (χ)) and transverse (e.g., D (χ ), χ = x, y, z but not equal to χ) cases. Obviously, from Supplementary Table III, the E2 to E4 mechanisms suggest the diﬀerence between D (χ) and D (χ ). With in-phase tilting ωχM , there are no longitudinal D ; in other words, D (χ)χ is zero. Using ωR and ωM , the nearest neighbor Bix,iy,iz − Bjx,jy,jz pair’s DMI can be written in a general form:

D (χ)η ∝ (−1)(ix+iy+iz)[KωηRδχ,η + K ωηR(1 − δχ,η) + κ(1 − δχ,η)(−1)iη ωηMη ]

(S5)

Similar to Eq. S2, the anti-phase and in-phase tiltings in supercell containing N 5-atom cells are deﬁned by

ωR = lmn(−1)(l+m+n)ωlmn/N , ωxMx = lmn(−1)(m+n)ωlmn,x/N , ωyMy = lmn(−1)(l+n)ωlmn,y/N , and ωzMz = lmn(−1)(l+m)ωlmn,z/N , respectively. Interestingly, the DMI involving i and j sites is determined by ωR or ωM deﬁned in the whole space (e.g., ωR =

1 N

lmn(−1)(l+m+n)ωlmn) rather than those deﬁned in a region localized around i and j sites. In other words, it

seems that the DMI discussed here is driven by in-phase or anti-phase tilting in a non-localized way. Indeed, only

the “simple” in-phase or anti-phase tiltings are considered to formulate the DMI in the present work. In fact, the

tilting pattern of BO6 can be more complicated than ωR and ωM . For example, in NaNbO3, complex tilting pattern

associated with (1/2, 1/2, 1/4) has also been detected [10]. If we include the various non-Brillouin-zone-boundary

related tilting modes (e.g., modes beyond R, Mx, My, and Mz), we may reach the DMI contributed by both localized and non-localized tiltings. On the other hand, if we interpret ωR or ωM in the basis localized around i and j sites,

we will arrive at a localized contribution to i − j pair’s DMI.

Now let us compare our results with the Di,j ∝ Kij(ωi − ωj) proposed in Refs. [11, 12] for magnetic DMI. We play with a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell (N = 8) at (ix, iy, iz) site and expand ωR by ωR = (−1)ix+iy+iz (ωix,iy,iz − ωix+1,iy,iz − ω ix,iy+1,iz − ω ix,iy,iz+1 + ω ix+1,iy+1,iz + ω ix+1,iy,iz+1 + ω ix,iy+1,iz+1 − ω ix+1,iy+1,iz+1)/8. In ﬁrst approximation (e.g.,

considering the nearest neighbors for i ≡ (ix, iy, iz) site only), the ωR can be written as (−1)ix+iy+iz (ωix,iy,iz − ω ix+1,iy,iz )/2, (−1)ix+iy+iz (ω ix,iy,iz −ω ix,iy+1,iz )/2, and (−1)ix+iy+iz (ω ix,iy,iz −ω ix,iy,iz+1)/2 when computing D (x),

D (y), and D (z), respectively. We further assume that in Eq. (S5), K = K , κ = 0, and we have D (x) ∝ K(ωix,iy,iz −

ωix+1,iy,iz )/2, D (y) ∝ K(ωix,iy,iz − ωix,iy+1,iz )/2, and D (z) ∝ K(ωix,iy,iz − ωix,iy,iz+1)/2; for the nearest neighbor

Bi − Bj pair’s DMI, via some special assumptions, we thus have arrived at D i,j ∝ K(ωi − ωj), which coincides with

Di,j ∝ Kij (ωi − ωj ).

As for the nearest neighbor Aix,iy,iz − Bjx,jy,jz pair, the situation is more complicated compared to that of B − B pair. This is quite easy to understand when realizing that the coordination number (CN) for B − B and A − B pairs

are diﬀerent (i.e., CN = 6 and CN = 8 for B − B and A − B pairs, respectively). In particular, the nearest neighbor

A − B pair is not along the x, y, or z directions, but along eight diﬀerent [lxlylz] orientations (lx, ly, lz = 0, 1) with

respect to cubic cell (see the caption of Supplementary Table IV for deﬁnition). From Supplementary Tables IV, V

and VI, the DMI of Aix,iy,iz − Bjx,jy,jz pair, denoted by D (lx, ly, lz)η, is summarized by the following equation:

D (lx, ly, lz)η ∝ (−1)(ix+iy+iz)[(−1)lx+ly+lz IωηR + (−1)iη (−1)lx+ly+lz+lη I ωηMη +

(S6)

Finally, none of our mechanisms (Table I in the main text and Supplementary Table II) hint towards the existence of a DMI for A − A pairs. On the other hand, it is interesting that non-collinear ferroelectricity can also be achieved in a way going beyond DMI, that is not involving a cross-product between local displacements. For instance, in Supplementary Discussion III, we have shown that the E14 mechanism can result in non-collinear ferroelectricity. There are six such kinds of mechanisms (summarized in Supplementary Table II) having the form of αβγ αβγωαQ1,βQ2,β, with α diﬀerent from β; none of them is related to a cross product and thus none of them can be thought as being a DMI interaction.

Supplementary Discussion V – The one-to-one correspondence between magnetic and electric DMI
We now discuss a bit on the transformations of the polar vectors u (e.g., the atomic displacement) and the axial vectors m (e.g., the magnetic moment) under the possible symmetric operations – the combination of proper rotations Cˆθ, improper rotations CˆθIˆ, and translations τˆt – in 3-dimensional Euclidean space (for the details, see Ref. [13]). Note that all the symmetric operations of 3-dimensional Euclidean space can be generated by the three types of transformations Cˆθ, CˆθIˆ, and τˆt. Of course, we should include the time-reversal operation (Tˆ ) as well. The proper rotation Cˆθ denotes the operation that rotates objects by θ angle along a certain axis [13]; the improper rotation CˆθIˆ is proper rotation Cˆθ combined with inversion Iˆ [13]; the translation τˆt has the following eﬀect: τˆtr → r + t [13]. Note that the above mentioned θ and t can be arbitrary rotation angle and translation vector, respectively. The

12
transformation of polar and axial vectors (e.g., u and m) are identical under pure rotational operations [14]. On the other hand, the improper rotations transform the polar and axial vectors in opposite ways [14]. For example, assuming that the inversion Iˆ is centered on the origin of u and m vectors, then we have: Iˆu → −u and Iˆm → m. An intuitive but not rigorous explanation is that the u is a displacement vector r which will obviously be reversed by inversion; while the m, magnetic moment, is analogous to the angular momentum (say, the orbital angular momentum L = r × p) which is not reversed by inversion (note that under inversion, r → −r, p → −p, and therefore r × p → r × p). Furthermore, the time-reversal Tˆ leaves u invariant but transforms m to −m. Now, let us analyze the transformation properties of ui × uj and mi × mj. First, under Tˆ we have ui → ui, uj → uj, mi → −mi, and mj → −mj. Consequently, both ui × uj and mi × mj remain invariant by Tˆ . Second, proper rotations and translations may shift the i and j sites to i and j sites, respectively, with (i , j ) being identical or not-identical to (i, j); meanwhile, both of them have additional eﬀects on the u and m vectors located at i or j sites; by proper rotations and translations the u and m vectors are transformed in the same way [14]. Overall, proper rotations and translations transforms ui × uj to u i × u j and mi × mj to m i × m j in a shared manner. Third, since the improper rotation CˆθIˆ is the combination of Cˆθ and Iˆ, we only need to investigate the transformation properties of ui × uj and mi × mj under Iˆ. Similarly, we have: Iˆui × uj → (−ui ) × (−uj ) and Iˆmi × mj → mi × mj , again, in a common manner. Hence, the transformation properties for ui × uj and mi × mj under the symmetry operations of 3-dimensional Euclidean space are exactly the same. The one-to-one correspondence between magnetic and electric DMI are thus established by the present work. In continuous model, the N´eel- and Bloch-type magnetic Skyrmions are described by magnetic DMI given by mz(∇ · m) − (m · ∇)mz [15, 16] and m · (∇ × m) [15, 17], respectively (m and mz being the magnetization vector and its z component). Based on our above analysis, it is natural to formulate the energetic terms, namely uz(∇ · u) − (u · ∇)uz and u · (∇ × u), for the electric N´eel- and Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions. Note that the existence of u · (∇ × u) and ferroelectric Bloch-type Skyrmions have been proposed by Ref. [18] as well. Let us end this section by emphasizing the one-to-one correspondence between magnetic and electric DMI. In other words, if a mechanism exists for magnetic (respectively, electric) DMI, a similar mechanism can work for electric (respectively, magnetic) DMI. One can thus naturally obtain the electric DMI mechanism by looking at the magnetic DMI term and replace the dual magnetic quantities (e.g., mi and mj in Dij · (mi × mj), m and ∇ × m in m · (∇ × m)) by dual electric quantities (e.g., ui and uj, u and ∇ × u), and vice versa. The reason involving the dual magnetic/electric quantities for replacement is to maintain the inversion and time-reversal symmetry.
Supplementary Discussion VI – Other possible mechanisms for DMI
So far, we have taken perovskites as our platforms and highlighted the electric DMI which depends on in-phase or anti-phase tiltings; we have also shown that the electric and magnetic DMI present one-to-one correspondence in this case (note also that our above mentioned DMI are all site-dependent, see e.g., the (−1)ix+iy+iz in Eq. S5). We are now wondering whether oxygen tiltings in perovskites are the unique factors to create the electric DMI, especially since it is well-known that the tiltings are not always the necessary conditions for magnetic DMI . This is evidenced by, e.g., the spin-current model for which the electric polarization is at the heart of the magnetic DMI [19]. We thus now aim at deriving and verifying another mechanism, involving the polarization, that may lead to electric DMI within the framework of tri-linear coupling and may be connected with the magnetic DMI based on the spin-current model. For simplicity, we assume that the polarization is homogeneous and oriented along the z direction (i.e., Pz) and we have also considered the qiz (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) order parameters deﬁned in Supplementary Fig. 6. For lattices containing 4N in-plane B sites, the order parameters associated with q1z, q2z, q3z, and q4z modulations (see Supplementary Fig. 6) are given by

Bαq1z =

[(−1)jx + 1][(−1)jy + 1](−1)(jx+jy)/2rjBx,jy,α/N

jx jy

Bαq2z =

[(−1)jx+1 + 1][(−1)jy + 1](−1)(jx+jy−1)/2rjBx,jy,α/N

where rjBx,jyα is the atomic displacement of B ion located at (jx, jy, jz) site; note that we omit the site index jz because the system is chosen to be homogeneous along z direction. We then derive an energetic term coupling the polarization and the Bαqiβ as follows

E = Pz (Bzq1z Bxq2z − Bxq1z Bzq2z + Bzq3z Bxq4z − Bxq3z Bzq4z ) −Pz (−Bzq1z Byq3z + Byq1z Bzq3z − Bzq2z Byq4z + Byq2z Bzq4z )

(S8)

Such analytical form is indeed an electric DMI induced by the electrical polarization! Note that Eqs. S8 and S4 can be used to derive the DMI vector induced by Pz, following the similar procedures and conventions in Supplementary Discussion IV. After some tedious but straightforward algebra, one can obtained the polarization-driven electric DMI as D (x)y ∝ Pz, D (y)x ∝ −Pz, and D (x)x = D (y)y = 0, with D (x)y, D (y)x, D (x)x and D (y)y having been deﬁned in Supplementary Discussion IV (see the sentences after Eq. S3 and the caption of Supplementary Fig. 6). One can also easily demonstrate by cyclic permutations that, if the polarization is along the x- instead of the z-direction, one has D (y)z ∝ Px, D (z)y ∝ −Px, and D (y)y = D (z)z = 0. Similar ideas apply when the polarization is along y. It is straightforward as well to obtain the polarization mediated DMI when the polarization is along the pseudo-cubic [111] direction (e.g., Px = Py = Pz for R3c ferroelectrics).

Supplementary Figure 6. Panels (a) to (d) are sketches of the q1z, q2z, q3z, and q4z modulations corresponding to ABO3 perovskite. The “+” and “-” signs denote that the atomic displacement on that site are along positive (e.g., +x, +y, or +z) and negative (e.g., −x, −y, or −z) directions, respectively. Note that only the modulations within the x − y plane are displayed; along z direction, the system is chosen to be homogeneous (see panel e). Panel (f) sketches the P 4mm structure of ABO3 perovskite, that does not have BO6 tilting but rather possesses a polarization contributed by B-site motions along the z direction. The electric DMI for i − j and i − k pairs are denoted by D (x) and D (y) vectors, respectively; for example, the x component of the DMI for i − k pair is represented by D (y)x.

Let us now check numerically whether Eq. S8 is valid for an electric DMI. For that, we conduct DFT simulations
using the VASP code and taking BiAlO3 as an example. We start from the cubic perovskite BiAlO3 (apc = 3.82 ˚A) and create a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell. We impose the BzΓ component on Al sites with the magnitude of 0.04 apc and then create the Bzq1z component on Al sites with varied magnitudes from -0.04 to 0.04 apc (BzΓ and Bzq1z mimic the polarization and anti-polar motions, respectively). Consequently, we have Bzq1z superimposed on BzΓ. We then found that DFT predicts that the forces acting on Al sites are associated with Bxq2z and Byq3z conﬁgurations (see Supplementary Fig. 7), which

thus validates Eq. S8 and consequently validates an electric DMI that depends on polarization rather than tiltings! One can also easily prove that the electric DMI of Eq. S8 corresponds to the magnetic DMI associated with the spincurrent model [20–22] by simply choosing the B quantities to be magnetic order parameters. For example, we can anticipate the magnetic DMI as D(x)y ∝ Pz, D(y)x ∝ −Pz, and D(x)x = D(y)y = 0 when the polarization is along the z-direction (e.g., Pz) – based on our established one-to-one correspondence between magnetic and electric DMI (see Supplementary Discussion V). It is now important to recall that, in the spin current model, the magnetic DMI is given by Dij ∝ P×eij where eij is the unit vector pointing from i site to j site and P is the polarization vector [19–22]; with a polarization Pzz and a eij = x, the spin-current model will then give Dij ∝ Pzy (e.g., D(x)y ∝ Pz); similarly, based on spin-current model, Pzz and eik = y will yield Dik ∝ −Pzx (e.g., D(y)x ∝ −Pz). Here, x, y, and z are unit vectors along x, y, and z directions (see e.g., Supplementary Fig. 6(f)). This totally coincides with our above analysis based on Eq. S8.
Let us now address another related topic. More precisely, in Ref. [18], the pseudo-Lifshitz term [17] u · (∇ × u) was raised to predict the Bloch skyrmion in ferroelectric systems. Note that (1) such pseudo-Lifshitz term resides in the continuous model, while our proposed Dij · (ui × uj) is for a discrete model, and (2) the term in Ref. [18] was written as uz∂ux/∂y − ux∂uz/∂y − uz∂uy/∂x + uy∂uz/∂x, which is a special form of u · (∇ × u); two other versions can be reached by doing the cyclic permutation (i.e., (x, y, z) → (y, z, x) and (x, y, z) → (z, x, y)) as ux∂uy/∂z − uy∂ux/∂z − ux∂uz/∂y + uz∂ux/∂y and uy∂uz/∂x − uz∂uy/∂x − uy∂ux/∂z + ux∂uy/∂z, respectively. The pseudo-Lifshitz term may hint a new mechanism of electric DMI (the so-called chiral DMI as proposed by Ref. [18]) that is also independent of the tiltings. Here, we shall just show that the pseudo-Lifshitz term do not apply to our considered mechanisms

15

which are mainly valid for non-collinear (anti-)ferroelectricity.

This is in fact readily to understand: u · (∇ × u) can be null in our cases. As a matter of fact, let us take

our trilinear coupling term ωzMz BxMz ByΓ as an example (see our E5 term by assuming that ωM is along z di-

rection). Here, BxMz and ByΓ indicate the Mz-point modulated anti-ferroelectric motions along x direction (say,

respectively;

and c are constants (coeﬃcients) and the integers jx jy and jz label each site in B sublattice of ABO3 perovskite.

Note that we use x, y and z to denote the unit vectors along x, y and z directions, respectively. As a result, the

To connect the continuous

model u · (∇ × u) with our discrete case, we need to discretize the pseudo-Lifshitz term. For example, we have

∇ × u → ( − )x + ( − )y + ujx,jy+1,jz,z−ujx,jy,jz,z
jy +1−jy

ujx,jy ,jz +1,y −ujx,jy ,jz ,y jz +1−jz

Hence,

u · (∇ × u) is zero because ∇ × u is along the z direction while u is within the x − y plane. In addition, let us take

a look at uz∂ux/∂y − ux∂uz/∂y − uz∂uy/∂x + uy∂uz/∂x proposed in Ref. [18] and the two equivalent derivative versions obtained by cyclic permutations. We can soon realize that the discrete version of them also gives zero value because ujx,jy,jz = (−1)jx+jy b x + c y has a null component along the z direction and the components along x and y directions do not depend on jz.

Supplementary Discussion VII – A comparison between spin cantings driven by magnetic DMI and inhomogenous dipole patterns driven by electric DMI

In Supplementary Discussion IV, taking ABO3 perovskite as our testing bed, we revealed the roles of BO6 tilting as the source of a possible electric DMI. Based on the one-to-one correspondence, the magnetic DMI, microscopically

originated from spin-orbit coupling, can be structurally rooted in the BO6 tilting as well. For example, the z-

oriented anti-phase BO6 tiltings (i.e., ωzR) implies electric D (x)z = (−1)ix+iy+iz KωzR (see Eq. S4) and magnetic

D(x)z

= (−1)ix+iy+iz κωzR, respectively.

It is interesting to know the ratio

K κ

,

which

is

D (x)z D(x)z

.

Note that the spin

(or magnetization) and dipole (or displacement) have diﬀerent units (e.g., µB vs ˚A), so as D and D. It is thus in

principle not possible to directly compare the magnetic and electric DMI strengths in a well-deﬁned manner. However,

based on the consequences arising from magnetic and electric DMI, the comparison can be fulﬁlled in some indirect

ways. Indeed, in non-collinear magnetism and (anti-)ferroelectricity, the spin and dipole cantings can result from

magnetic and electric DMI (see e.g., our mechanisms in Table I of the main text), respectively. We thus employ the

magnetic LaFeO3 system to test how strong is the electric DMI as compared to the magnetic DMI. Again, we start from the cubic LaFeO3 with 40-atom supercell (e.g., 2 × 2 × 2, a = 2apc = 7.64 ˚A), impose the various anti-phase tiltings about the z-axis (ωzR) from about -4.5 to 4.5 Degree; for each ωzR value, we then (1) create on Fe ions the R−point modulated (see Supplementary Table I, magnetic version of by BxR) predominant magnetic vectors along the
x direction, and run non-collinear magnetic calculations including the spin-orbit coupling (self-consistent calculations

without optimizing crystal structures), and (2) create on Fe ions the R−point modulated predominant displacement vectors along x direction (electric version of BxR), and structurally optimize – using selective dynamics methods in VASP – the other degrees of freedom but ﬁx the oxygen positions, the Fe positions along the x axis as well as the

lattice parameters (using R−point modulated scalar magnetism without including spin-orbit coupling).

The noncollinear magnetism calculations give a weak magnetism along the y directions (for the magnetic version of ByΓ). Similarly, the selective dynamics optimization results in weak ferroelectric motions along the y-direction (for the electric version of ByΓ). This again conﬁrms the one-to-one correspondence between magnetic and electric DMI. Note that the dipole canting for BiAlO3 in the presence of ωzR is further checked following a similar strategy used for LaFeO3 based on PBEsol functional. It is worth emphasizing that the spin-canting angles in LaFeO3 arises from two facts: the magnetic Dij which favors the 900 or 2700 between the angles of nearest-neighbor spin pairs Si and Sj according to Dij · (Si × Sj), and the exchange interaction Jij which favors the 180 or 00 between that
of Si and Sj by JijSi · Sj. Hence, the spin-canting angle is a measure of D/J (e.g., the ratio between DMI and
exchange interaction). Similarly, in the electric counterpart, the electric version of exchange interaction Jij together with DMI Dij determines the dipole canting. Thus the dipole-canting angles reﬂects the electric ratio D /J . In other words, our above comparison between ωzR driven dipole and spin cantings, in fact, is a comparison between electric D /J and magnetic D/J (shown as Fig. 4 of the main text). The slope of lines in Fig. 4 of the main

text, obtained by linear ﬁtting, indicates the electric K/J for LaFeO3, electric K/J BiAlO3, and magnetic κ/J for LaFeO3, respectively, with the values of 0.0067, 0.012, and 0.001 per Degree. Hence, the electric D /J can be much

16
larger than the magnetic D/J.
