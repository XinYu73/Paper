We consider mixed states of two qubits and show under which global unitary operations their entanglement is maximized. This leads to a class of states that is a generalization of the Bell states. Three measures of entanglement are considered: entanglement of formation, negativity and relative entropy of entanglement. Surprisingly all states that maximize one measure also maximize the others. We will give a complete characterization of these generalized Bell states and prove that these states for ﬁxed eigenvalues are all equivalent under local unitary transformations. We will furthermore characterize all nearly entangled states closest to the maximally mixed state and derive a new lower bound on the volume of separable mixed states.

In this paper we investigate how much entanglement in a mixed two qubit system can be created by global unitary transformations. The class of states for which no more entanglement can be created by global unitary operations is clearly a generalization of the class of Bell states to mixed states, and gives strict bounds on how the mixedness of a state limits its entanglement. This question is of considerable interest as entanglement is the magic ingredient of quantum information theory and experiments always deal with mixed states. Recently, Ishizaka and Hiroshima [1] independently considered the same question. They proposed a class of states and conjectured that the entanglement of formation [2] and the negativity [3] of these states could not be increased by any global unitary operation. Here we rigorously prove their conjecture and furthermore prove that the states they proposed are the only ones having the property of maximal entanglement.
Closely related to the issue of generalized Bell states is the question of characterizing the set of separable density matrices [5], as the entangled states closest to the maximally mixed state necessarily have to belong to the proposed class of maximal entangled mixed states. We can thus give a complete characterization of all nearly entangled states lying on the boundary of the sphere of separable states surrounding the maximally mixed state. As a byproduct this gives an alternative derivation of the well known result of Zyczkowski et al. [3] that all states for which the inequality Tr(ρ2) ≤ 1/3 holds are separable.
The original motivation of this paper was the following question: given a single quantum mechanical system consisting of two unentangled spin-1/2 systems, i.e. two qubits, one in a pure state and another in a maximally mixed state, does there exist a global unitary transformation on both qubits such that they become entangled? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. In this paper we solve the more general question: how can one maximize the entanglement of an arbitrary mixerd state of two qubits using only unitary operations. If not only unitary operations but also measurements were allowed, it is clear that a Von

Neumann measurement in the Bell basis would immediatly yield a singlet. Here however we restrict ourselves to unitary operations. Obviously, these unitary operations must be global ones, that is, acting on the system as a whole, since any reasonable measure of entanglement must be invariant under local unitary operations, acting only on single qubits. As measures of entanglement, the entanglement of formation (EoF) [2], the negativity [3] and the relative entropy of entanglement [4] were chosen.
The entanglement of formation of mixed states is deﬁned variationally as Ef (ρ) = min{ψi} i piE(ψi) where ρ = i piψiψi†. For 2 × 2 systems the EoF is wellcharacterized by introducing the concurrence C [2]:

Here {σi} are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix A arranged in decreasing order

S = σy ⊗ σy.

H(x) is Shannon’s entropy function and σy is the Pauli matrix. It can be shown that f (C) is convex and monotonously increasing. Using some elementary linear algebra it is furthermore easy to prove that the numbers √{σρiT}Sa√reρ.eqHuearletwo ethuesesitnhgeunlaortavtailounes√[ρ8]=ofΦtΛh1e/2mgaitvreinx ΦΛΦ†, the eigenvalue decomposition of ρ.
The concept of negativity of a state is closely related to the well-known Peres condition for separability of a state [6]. If a state is separable (disentangled), then the partial transpose of the state is again a valid state, i.e. it is positive. For 2 × 2 systems, this condition is also suﬃcient [7]. It turns out that the partial transpose of a non-separable state has one negative eigenvalue. From this, a measure for entanglement follows: the negativity of a state [3] is equal to the trace norm of its partial

1

transpose. We will adopt the deﬁnition of negativity as twice the absolute value of this negative eigenvalue:

EN (ρ) = 2 max(0, −λ4),

(5)

where λ4 is the minimal eigenvalue of ρTA . In the case of two qubits, this is equivalent to the trace norm of the partial transpose up to an aﬃne mapping.
The relative entropy of entanglement was proposed by Vedral and Plenio [4] as a measure of entanglement motivated by the classical concept of Kullback-Leibler distance between probability distributions. This measure has very nice properties such as being a good upper bound for the entanglement of distillation. It is variationally deﬁned as

where D represents the convex set of all separable density operators.
We now state our main result:

Theorem 1 Let the eigenvalue decomposition of ρ be

ρ = ΦΛΦ†

where the eigenvalues {λi} are sorted in non-ascending order. The entanglement of formation is maximized if
and only if a global unitary transformation of the form

is applied to the system, where U1 and U2 are local unitary operations and Dφ is a unitary diagonal matrix. This same global unitary transformation is the unique
transformation maximizing the negativity and the relative
entropy of entanglement. The entanglement of formation and negativity of the new state ρ′ = U ρU † are then given by

Ef (ρ′) = f max 0, λ1 − λ3 − 2 λ2λ4 EN (ρ′) = max 0, (λ1 − λ3)2 + (λ2 − λ4)2 − λ2 − λ4

respectively, while the expression for the relative entropy of entanglement is given by
ER(ρ′) = Tr(ρ log ρ) − λ1 log((1 − a)/2) − λ2 log((a + b + 2(λ2 − λ4))/4) − λ3 log((1 − b)/2) − λ4 log((a + b − 2(λ2 − λ4))/4)
a = (d − d2 − 4(1 − λ1)(1 − λ3)(λ2 − λ4)2)/(2(1 − λ3)) b = (d − d2 − 4(1 − λ1)(1 − λ3)(λ2 − λ4)2)/(2(1 − λ1)) d = λ2 + λ4 + (λ2 − λ4)2

The class of generalized Bell states is deﬁned as the states ρ′ thus obtained. These states are the maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS-states).
We now present the complete proof of this Theorem. The cases of entanglement of formation, negativity and relative entropy of entanglement will be treated independently. We start with the entanglement of formation.
As the function f (x) is monotonously increasing, maximizing the EoF is equivalent to maximizing the concurrence. The problem is now reduced to ﬁnding:

Cmax = max (0, σ1 − σ2 − σ3 − σ4)

(7)

U ∈U (4)

with {σi} the singular values of

Q = Λ1/2ΦT U T SU ΦΛ1/2.

(8)

Now, Φ, U and S are unitary, and so is any product of them. It then follows that

Cmax ≤ max (0, σ1 − σ2 − σ3 − σ4)

(9)

V ∈U(4)

with {σi} the singular values of Λ1/2V Λ1/2. The inequality becomes an equality if there is a unitary matrix U such that the optimal V can be written as ΦT U T SU Φ.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for this is that the optimal V be symmetric (V = V T ): as S is symmetric and unitary, it can be written as a product S1T S1, with S1 again unitary. This is known as the Takagi factorization
of S [8]. This factorization is not unique: left-multiplying S1 with a complex orthogonal matrix O (OT O = 11) also
yields a valid Takagi factor. An explicit form of S1 is given by:

 0 1 1 0

S1

If V is symmetric it can also be factorized like this:
V = V1T V1. It is now easy to see that any U of the form

U = S1†OV1Φ†,

(11)

with O real orthogonal, indeed yields V = V1T V1. To proceed, we need two inequalities concerning singu-
lar values of matrix products. Henceforth, singular values, as well as eigenvalues will be sorted in non-ascending
order. The following inequality for singular values is wellknown [9]:

Lemma 1 Let A ∈ Mn,r(C), B ∈ Mr,m(C). Then,

(13)

Set n = 4 in both inequalities. Then put k = 1 in the
ﬁrst, and k = 3, i1 = 2, i2 = 3, i3 = 4 in the second. Subtracting the inequalities then gives:

σ1(AB) − (σ2(AB) + σ3(AB) + σ4(AB)) ≤ σ1(A)σ1(B) − σ2(A)σ4(B) − σ3(A)σ3(B) − σ4(A)σ2(B)
Furthermore, let A = Λ1/2 and B = V Λ1/2, with Λ positive diagonal and with the diagonal elements√sorted in non-ascending order. Thus, σi(A) = σi(B) = λi. This gives:

(σ1 − (σ2 + σ3 + σ4))(Λ1/2V Λ1/2) ≤ λ1 − (2 λ2λ4 + λ3).

It is easy to see that this inequality becomes an equality iﬀ V is equal to the permutation matrix

1 0 0 0

multiplied by an arbitrary unitary diagonal matrix Dφ. Therefore, we have proven:
maxV ∈U(4) (σ1 − (σ2 + σ3 + σ4))(Λ1/2V Λ1/2) = λ1 − (2 λ2λ4 + λ3). (15)

We can directly apply this to the problem at hand. The
optimal V is indeed symmetric, so that it can be decomposed as V = V1T V1. A possible Takagi factor is:

 1 0√ 0 0√ 

The optimal unitary operations U are thus all of the form: U = S1†OV1Dφ1/2Φ† with O an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. It has to be emphasized that the diagonal matrix Dφ will not have any eﬀect on the state ρ′ = U ΦΛΦ†U †.
To proceed we exploit a well-known accident in Lie
group theory :

SU (2) ⊗ SU (2) ∼= SO(4).

(17)

It now happens that the unitary matrix S1 is exactly of the form for making S1(U1 ⊗ U2)S1† real for arbitrary {U1, U2} ∈ SU (2). It follows that S1(U1 ⊗ U2)S1†

is orthogonal and thus is an element of SO(4). Conversely, each element Q ∈ SO(4) can be written as Q = S1(U1 ⊗ U2)S1†. On the other hand the orthogonal matrices with determinant equal to −1 can all be written
as an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1 multiplied by a ﬁxed matrix of determinant −1. Some calculations
reveal that

We conclude that for each O ∈ O(4) and Dφ unitary diagonal, there exist U1, U2 ∈ SU (2) and Dφ′ unitary diagonal, such that U = S1†OV1DφΦ† = (U1 ⊗U2)S1†V1Dφ′ Φ†.
It is now easy to check that a unitary transformation
produces maximal entanglement of formation if and only
if it is of the form

01 0 0

This completes the proof of the ﬁrst part of the Theorem. We now proceed to prove the second part of the Theo-
rem concerning the negativity. This proof is based on the Rayleigh-Ritz variational characterization of the minimal eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix:

λmin(ρTA ) = min Tr ρTA |x x|
x:||x||=1
= min Tr ρ(|x x|)TA
x:||x||=1

(19)

The eigenvalue decomposition of (|x x|)TA can best be
deduced from its singular value decomposition. Let x˜ denote a reshaping of the vector x to a 2 × 2 matrix with x˜ij = ei ⊗ ej|x . Introducing the permutation matrix P0 = ij eij ⊗ eji, the partial transpose can be written as follows:

(|x x|)TA = P0(x˜ ⊗ x˜†).

(20)

The proof of this statement is elementary. We denote the Schmidt decomposition of the vector |x by

x˜ = U1ΣU2†,

(21)

where the diagonal elements of Σ are given by σ1, σ2. Since x is normalized we can parameterize these as cos(α), sin(α) with 0 ≤ α ≤ π/4 (to maintain the or-
dering). We get

(|x x|)TA = P0(U1 ⊗ U2)(Σ ⊗ Σ)(U2 ⊗ U1)†. (22)

This clearly is a singular value decomposition. The ex-
plicit eigenvalue decomposition can now be calculated using the basic property of P0 that P0(A ⊗ B) = (B ⊗ A)P0 for arbitrary A, B. It is then easy to check that the eigenvalue decomposition of (|x x|)TA is given by:

3

(|x x|)TA = V (x)D(α(x))V (x)†

(23)

where D(α(x)) is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues (σ12, σ1σ2, σ22, −σ1σ2) and

For the problem at hand, we have to minimize the minimal eigenvalue of (U ρU †)TA over all possible U ∈ U (4).
Thus, we have to minimize:

min Tr U ΦΛΦ†U †V (x)D(α(x))V (x)†
U,x
= min min Tr ΛW †D(α)W, (25)
αW

where we have absorbed the eigenvector matrix Φ of ρ, as well as V (x)†, into U , yielding W . Now, the min-
imization over W can be done by writing the trace in
components

g(α) = Tr ΛW †D(α)W

= dj (α)|Wji|2λi
i,j

= d(α)T J(W )λ,

(26)

where d(α) and λ denote the vectors containing the diagonal elements of D(α) and Λ, respectively. J(W ) is a doubly stochastic matrix formed from W by taking the modulus squared of every element. The minimum over all W is attained when J(W ) is a permutation matrix; this follows from Birkhoﬀ’s theorem [8], which says that the set of doubly-stochastic matrices is the convex closure of the set of permutation matrices, and also of the fact that our object function is linear. Since the components of σ and λ are sorted in descending order and λ is positive, the permutation matrix yielding the minimum for any α is the matrix

0 0 0 1

J0

=

 

0 0

.

(27)

1000

Thus W has to be chosen equal to J0 multiplied by a di-

agonal unitary matrix Dφ. Hence, the minimum over W

is given by

4 j=1

λj d4+1−j (α).

Minimizing

over

α

gives,

after a few basic calculations:

cos(2α) =

λ2 − λ4

(λ1 − λ3)2 + (λ2 − λ4)2

g(α) = λ2 + λ4 − (λ1 − λ3)2 + (λ2 − λ4)2 /2.

This immediately yields the conjectured formula for the optimal negativity.

We now have to ﬁnd the U for which this optimum is reached. As V (x)†U Φ = W , it follows that the optimal
unitary transformation U is given by U = V (x)J0DφΦ†:

 0√ 0 0√ 1 

This is exactly the same U as in the case of entanglement of formation.
Next we move to the third part of the theorem concerning the relative entropy of entanglement. We ﬁrst prove two lemmas.

Lemma 3 Consider the class of superoperators
T (ρ) = aiUiρUi†,
i
where all Ui are unitary, and the ai form a distribution. Then, for any state ρ that is invariant under T , we have for the relative entropy:
S(ρ||σ) ≥ S(ρ||T †(σ)).

Proof. The proof of this lemma is heavily inspired by theorem 6 in Rains [11]. From S(ρ) = S(T (ρ)), we ﬁnd
S(ρ||σ) = Tr ρ log ρ − Tr ρ log σ = Tr ρ log ρ − Tr T (ρ) log σ = Tr ρ log ρ − ai Tr UiρUi† log σ
i
= Tr ρ log ρ − ai Tr ρ log(Ui†σU − i)
i
≥ Tr ρ log ρ − Tr ρ log( aiUi†σU − i)
i
= S(ρ||T †(σ)),

where in the penultimate line, we have used the subadditivity of the relative entropy w.r.t. its second argument.

Lemma 4 For ρ of the form ρ = U ΛU † with

 0√ 0 0√ 1 

and Λ containing the ordered eigenvalues of ρ,
ER(ρ) = min S(ρ||σ). σ∈D∩MEMS
where MEMS is the class of maximally entangled mixed states.

4

Proof. Deﬁne the following superoperator: T (ρ) = V diag(V †ρV )V †.

Here, diag(ρ) is the superoperator that sets all oﬀdiagonal elements of ρ equal to zero while keeping the diagonal ones intact. This superoperator can also be written as

diag(ρ) = PiρPi/2n,
i

where Pi runs through all possible diagonal matrices having only +1 or −1 on their diagonal [12]. It follows that T

is of the form mentioned in the ﬁrst Lemma and, further-

more, that it is a self-dual superoperator, i.e. T † = T .

It is obvious that all MEMS states (with U1 = U2 = 11)

are left invariant by T . We will now show that any such

T maps separable states to separable states. Consider

thereto the pure product states only; if the proposition

is valid for pure product states, it will be valid for all

separable states (by linearity). The most general pure

product state has the state vector ψ = (ac, ad, bc, bd),

with a, b, c, d complex numbers. Then, since

√

√

V †ψ = ((ad + bc)/ 2, bd, (ad − bc)/ 2, ac),

T (ψψ†) = V diag(V †ψψ†V )V † = V ΛV †,

where the diagonal elements of Λ are, in order, (|(ad + bc)/√2|2, |bd|2, |(ad − bc)/√2|2, |ac|2).

As these values are not necessarily sorted, T (ψψ†) need not be MEMS. However, it is still possible to apply the formula for the negativity of MEMS states which says that

EN (ρ) = max(0, (λ1 − λ3)2 + (λ2 − λ4)2 − λ2 − λ4).

As can be easily checked, the validity of this formula does not rely on the ordering of the λi, as long as each λi pertains to the i-th column of V . In particular, using
λ1 − λ3 = 2ℜ(ab(cd)∗) λ2 ± λ4 = |bd|2 ± |ac|2,
we get for the negativity of T (ψψ†):
EN (T (ψψ†)) = max(0, F )
with

F = (λ1 − λ3)2 + (λ2 − λ4)2 − (λ2 + λ4) = 4ℜ(ab(cd)∗)2 + |bd|4 + |ac|4 − 2|abcd|2 −(|bd|2 + |ac|2)
= |bd|4 + |ac|4 + 2|abcd|2 − 4ℑ(ab(cd)∗)2 −(|bd|2 + |ac|2)
= (|bd|2 + |ac|2)2 − 4ℑ(ab(cd)∗)2 − (|bd|2 + |ac|2) ≤ 0.

Hence, T (ψψ†) is separable, as we set out to prove, so that T maps separable states to separable states.
From the previous discussion it also follows that states of the form V ΛV † are separable if and only if the eigenvalues satisfy

(λ1 − λ3)2 + (λ2 − λ4)2 − λ2 − λ4 ≤ 0

(29)

Furthermore, states V ΛV † are obviously invariant under T . Hence, letting σ traverse all separable states of this form generates the same set of states T (σ) as letting σ traverse all separable states without restriction. Therefore,

ER(ρ)

=

min
σ∈D

S(ρ||σ)

≥ min S(ρ||T (σ))
σ∈D

= min S(ρ||σ).
σ=V ΛV †∈D

Comparing the ﬁrst and the third line, we immediately see that the inequality must be an equality.
Actually, an even stronger result holds, as we can restrict ourselves in this minimization to states σ = V ΛV † ∈ D where the diagonal elements appear in descending order (λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ λ3 ≥ λ4). In other words, σ may be taken from the set of separable MEMS states. To see this, note that, as ρ and σ are both MEMS,

S(ρ||σ) = pi(lg pi − lg λi),
i
where the pi are the sorted eigenvalues of ρ, and λi are the not necessarily sorted eigenvalues of σ. It is easy to see that one always gets a lower relative entropy by permuting the λi into descending order [12]. This ends the proof of the lemma.
It is now easy to prove the last part of the main theorem: Because the σ are restricted to separable MEMS states, this means that, for any global unitary U , U σU † is still separable. Hence, for ρ ∈ MEMS,
ER(ρ) = min S(ρ||σ) σ∈D∩MEMS
= min S(U ρU †||U σU †) σ∈D∩MEMS
≥ min S(U ρU †||U σU †)
UσU †∈D
= ER(U ρU †),

where the inequality in the penultimate line arises because the minimization domain has been enlarged. Therefore the MEMS states have larger relative entropy of entanglement then all states that can be obtained from it by doing global unitary operations.

5

The explicit calculation of the relative entropy of en-

tanglement of the maximally entangled mixed states is

now a tedious but straightforward exercise, whose result

is quoted in the theorem. This completes the proof of

Theorem 1.

2

Let us now analyze more closely the newly deﬁned class

of generalized Bell states. We already know that U is

unique up to local unitary transformations. It is easy

to check that the ordered eigenvalues of the generalized

Bell states for given entanglement of formation f (C) are

parameterized by two independent variables α and β:

(30)

For given EoF there is thus, up to local unitary transformations, a two dimensional manifold of maximally entangled states. In the case of concurrence C = 1 the upper and lower bounds on β become equal and the unique pure Bell states arise. Another observation is the fact that λ4 of all generalized Bell states is smaller then 1/6. This implies that if the smallest eigenvalue of whatever two-qubit state exceeds 1/6, this state is separable.
A natural question is now how to characterize the entangled states closest to the maximally mixed state. A sensible metric is given by the Frobenius norm ρ−11 2 =
i λ2i − 1/4. This norm is only dependent on the eigenvalues of ρ and it is thus suﬃcient to consider the generalized Bell states at the boundary of entangled states where both the concurrence and the negativity become zero. This can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. A straightforward calculation leads to a one-parameter family of solutions:

(31)

The Frobenius norm ρ − 11 2 for all these states on the boundary of the sphere of separable states is given by the number 1/12. This criterion is exactly equivalent to the well-known criterion of Zyczkowski et al. [3]:

Tr ρ2 = 1/3. Here, however, we have the additional beneﬁt of knowing exactly all the entangled states on this boundary as these are the generalized Bell states with eigenvalues given by the previous formula. Furthermore, Zyczkowski et al. [3] proposed a lower bound on the volume of separable states by considering the ball of states that remain separable under all global unitary transformations. Clearly the c√riterion i λ2i ≤ 1/3 can be strengthened to λ1 − λ3 − 2 λ2λ4 ≤ 0. Some tedious integration then leads to a better lower bound for the volume of separable states relative to the volume of all states: 0.3270 (as opposed to 0.3023 of [3]).
Further interesting properties of the maximally entangled mixed states include the fact that the states with maximal entropy for given entanglement all belong to this class. This can be seen as follows: the global entropy of a state is a function of the eigenvalues of the density matrix only. Therefore the states with maximal entanglement for given entropy can be found by ﬁrst looking for the states with maximal entanglement for ﬁxed eigenvalues, followed by maximizing the entropy of the obtained class of (maximally entangled) mixed states.
In conclusion, we have generalized the concept of pure Bell states to mixed states of two qubits. We have proven that the entanglement of formation, the negativity and the relative entropy of entanglement of these generalized Bell states could not be increased by applying any global unitary transformation. Whether their entanglement of distillation is also maximal is an interesting open problem.
