Abstract

The Gibbs free energies of bcc and fcc Mo are calculated from first principles in the quasiharmonic approximation in the pressure range from 350 to 850 GPa at room temperatures up to 7500 K. It is found that Mo, stable in the bcc phase at low temperatures, has lower free energy in the fcc structure than in the bcc phase at elevated temperatures. Our density-functional-theory-based molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that fcc melts at higher than bcc temperatures above 1.5 Mbar. Our calculated melting temperatures and bcc-fcc boundary are consistent with the Mo Hugoniot sound speed measurements. We find that melting occurs at temperatures significantly above the bcc-fcc boundary. This suggests an explanation of the recent diamond anvil cell experiments, which find a phase boundary in the vicinity of our extrapolated bcc-fcc boundary.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

    Data on the phase stability of Mo. The bcc-fcc phase boundary was constructed using the results shown in Fig. 1. Circles, diamonds, triangles and squares represent melting conditions obtained from AIMD for bcc and fcc Mo; the legend indicates the number of atoms in the AIMD simulation; except one point (bcc, 2-phase method) the method was used. Unless shown explicitly, the error bar is smaller than the size of the corresponding symbol. Our fcc and bcc melting curves obtained from AIMD simulations are shown as solid thick and thin curves, respectively. The two points with temperature error bars are the solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions as measured in shock-wave experiments [, ]; the corresponding phases on the Hugoniot are shown as a solid curve (bcc phase), long dashed curve (another solid phase), and short-dashed curve (liquid).
