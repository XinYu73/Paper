Abstract
The entanglement of a pure state of a pair of quantum systems is deﬁned as the entropy of either member of the pair. The entanglement of formation of a mixed state ρ is deﬁned as the minimum average entanglement of an ensemble of pure states that represents ρ. An earlier paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 5022 (1997)] conjectured an explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of a pair of binary quantum objects (qubits) as a function of their density matrix, and proved the formula to be true for a special class of mixed states. The present paper extends the proof to arbitrary states of this system and shows how to construct entanglement-minimizing pure-state decompositions.

Entanglement is the feature of quantum mechanics that allows, in princi-

ple, feats such as teleportation [1] and dense coding [2] and is what Schr¨odinger

called “the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics [3].” A pure state of a

pair of quantum systems is called entangled if it does not factorize, that is, if

each separate system does not have a pure state of its own. A classic example

is

the

singlet

state

of

two

spin-

1 2

particles,

√1 2

(|

↑↓

− | ↓↑

), in which neither

particle has a deﬁnite spin direction. A mixed state is entangled if it cannot

be represented as a mixture of factorizable pure states. In the last couple of

years a good deal of work has been devoted to ﬁnding physically motivated

measures of entanglement, particularly for mixed states of a bipartite system

[4, 5, 6]. Perhaps the most basic of these measures is the entanglement of

formation, which is intended to quantify the resources needed to create a

given entangled state [6].

Having a well justiﬁed and mathematically tractable measure of entan-

glement is likely to be of value in a number of areas of research, including

the study of decoherence in quantum computers [7] and the evaluation of

quantum cryptographic schemes [8]. Unfortunately, most proposed measures

of entanglement involve extremizations which are diﬃcult to handle analyti-

cally; the entanglement of formation is no exception to this rule. However, in

the special case of entanglement between two binary quantum systems such

as

the

spin

of

a

spin-

1 2

particle

or

the

polarization

of

a

photon—systems

that

are generically called “qubits”—an explicit formula for the entanglement of

formation has recently been conjectured and has been proved for a special

class of density matrices [9]. In this Letter we prove the formula for arbitrary

states of two qubits.

The entanglement of formation is deﬁned as follows [6]. Given a den-

sity matrix ρ of a pair of quantum systems A and B, consider all possible

pure-state decompositions of ρ, that is, all ensembles of states |ψi with prob-

abilities pi such that

ρ = pi|ψi ψi|.

(1)

i

For each pure state, the entanglement E is deﬁned as the entropy of either

of the two subsystems A and B [4]:

E(ψ) = −Tr (ρA log2 ρA) = −Tr (ρB log2 ρB).

(2)

2

Here ρA is the partial trace of |ψ ψ| over subsystem B, and ρB is deﬁned similarly. The entanglement of formation of the mixed state ρ is then deﬁned as the average entanglement of the pure states of the decomposition, minimized over all decompositions of ρ:

E(ρ) = min piE(ψi).

(3)

i

The basic equation (2) is justiﬁed by the physical interconvertibility of a collection of pairs in an arbitrary pure state |ψ and a collection of pairs in the standard singlet state, the asymptotic conversion ratio being given by E(ψ) [4]. The central claim of this Letter is that for a pair of qubits, the minimum value speciﬁed in Eq. (3) can be expressed as an explicit function of ρ, which we develop in the next few paragraphs. For ease of expression we will usually refer to the entanglement of formation simply as “the entanglement.”
Our formula for entanglement makes use of what can be called the “spin ﬂip” transformation, which is a function applicable both to state vectors and to density matrices of an arbitrary number of qubits. For a pure state of a single qubit, the spin ﬂip, which we denote by a tilde, is deﬁned by

|ψ˜ = σy|ψ∗ ,

(4)

where |ψ∗ is the complex conjugate of |ψ when it is expressed in a ﬁxed

basis such as {| ↑ , | ↓ }, and σy expressed in that same basis is the matrix

0 i

−i 0

.

For

a

spin-

1 2

particle

this

is

the

standard

time

reversal

operation

and indeed reverses the direction of the spin [10]. To perform a spin ﬂip on

n qubits, one applies the above transformation to each individual qubit. If

the system is described by a density matrix rather than a state vector, each

σy is applied on both the right and the left. For example, for a general state ρ of two qubits—the object of interest in this Letter—the spin-ﬂipped state

is

ρ˜ = (σ2 ⊗ σ2)ρ∗(σ2 ⊗ σ2),

(5)

where again the complex conjugate is taken in the standard basis, which for

a

pair

of

spin-

particles

is

In

this

case

the

spin

ﬂip

is equivalent [11] to “complex conjugation in the magic basis,” which appears

in Ref. [9].

Though we have introduced the spin ﬂip transformation primarily to deal with mixed states, the concept is also convenient for expressing the entanglement of a pure state of two qubits. One can show that this entanglement, deﬁned in Eq. (2), can be written as [9]

E(ψ) = E(C(ψ)),

(6)

where the “concurrence” C is deﬁned as

C(ψ) = | ψ|ψ˜ |,

(7)

and the function E is given by

(8)

The function E(C) is monotonically increasing, and ranges from 0 to 1 as

C goes from 0 to 1, so that one can take the concurrence as a measure

of entanglement in its own right. For example, the singlet state | ψ =

√1 (| ↑↓ − | ↓↑ ) is left unchanged by a spin ﬂip (except for an overall 2
negative sign), so that its concurrence | ψ|ψ˜ | is equal to 1. At the other

extreme, an unentangled, or factorizable, pure state such as | ↑↓ is always

mapped by the spin ﬂip transformation into an orthogonal state, so that its

concurrence is zero. Later we will use another fact about E(C), namely, that

it is a convex function (that is, curving upward).

Having deﬁned the spin ﬂip and the function E(C), we can now present

the promised formula for the entanglement of formation of a mixed state ρ

of two qubits:

E(ρ) = E(C(ρ)),

(9)

where

C(ρ) = max {0, λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4},

the eigenvalues, in Alternatively, one

decreasing order, can say that the

of the Hermitian matrix λis are the square roots

of the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian matrix ρρ˜. Note that each λi is a

4

non-negative real number. The matrices R and ρρ˜ may seem unlikely objects to be using in any formula, but one can see that they are closely related to the pure-state concurrence of Eq. (7). In fact for a pure state |ψ , R has only one eigenvalue that may be nonzero, namely, C(ψ).
The formula (9) was shown in Ref. [9] to be correct for all density matrices of two qubits having no more than two nonzero eigenvalues. More recently, Smolin has tested the formula numerically on several thousand randomly chosen two-qubit density matrices and has found complete agreement [12]. Most of the rest of this Letter is devoted to proving that the formula is correct for arbitrary states of this system. We will ﬁnd that the value E(C(ρ)) of the average entanglement can always be achieved by a decomposition of ρ consisting of four or fewer pure states, each state having the same entanglement. (Uhlmann has already shown that the optimal decomposition must consist of pure states with equal entanglement [14], but we do not assume this result in our proof.) We will then show that no decomposition has a smaller average entanglement.
Our method will be to look explicitly for an entanglement-minimizing decomposition of ρ. We use the fact that every decomposition of a density matrix can be obtained via the following prescription [13]. First, ﬁnd a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors |vi corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalues of ρ, and “subnormalize” these vectors so that vi|vi is equal to the ith eigenvalue. Every decomposition {|wi } of ρ can then be obtained through the following equation, and every set of states that can be obtained in this way is a legitimate decomposition of ρ:

n
|wi = Ui∗j|vj .
j=1

(11)

Here n is the rank of ρ, that is, the number of vectors |vi , and U is an m × m unitary matrix, m being greater than or equal to n. (The complex conjugation is included only for later convenience.) Alternatively, since only the ﬁrst n columns of U are used, we can take U to be an m×n matrix whose columns are orthonormal vectors. If m is greater than n, the decomposition will have more elements than are necessary for the creation of ρ, but such decompositions are certainly allowed. The states |wi in Eq. (11) are automatically subnormalized so that wi|wi is equal to the probability of |wi in the decomposition. We can thus write ρ = i |wi wi|. In what follows, we

5

express all decompositions of ρ in terms of such subnormalized vectors.

It is helpful to consider separately two classes of density matrix: (i) those

for which λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4 is positive or zero, and (ii) those for which the

Again, the numbers λi consider class (i) ﬁrst.

are

the

eigenvalues

of

For any density matrix ρ in this class, we will deﬁne successively three

speciﬁc decompositions of ρ, the last of which will be the optimal decompo-

sition that we seek. Each of these decompositions consists of exactly n pure

states, n being the rank of ρ as above. For the system we are considering, n

is always less than or equal to 4.

The ﬁrst decomposition consists of states |xi , i = 1, . . . , n, satisfying

xi|x˜j = λiδij.

(12)

The states |xi can be said to be “tilde-orthogonal.” We obtain such a decomposition as follows. First note that if the set {|xi } is deﬁned via an n × n unitary matrix U as in Eq. (11), then the “tilde inner products” xi|x˜j can be written as

xi|x˜j = (U τ U T )ij,

(13)

where τij ≡ vi|v˜j is a symmetric but not necessarily Hermitian matrix. (The states |vi are the eigenstates of ρ deﬁned earlier.) In order that condition (12) be satisﬁed, we want Uτ UT to be diagonal. It happens that for any
symmetric matrix τ , one can always ﬁnd a unitary U that diagonalizes τ in this way [15]. Moreover, the diagonal elements of Uτ UT can always be
made real and non-negative, in which case they are the square roots of the eigenvalues of τ τ ∗. (To see how this works, note that U must diagonalize τ τ ∗ in the usual sense; that is, Uτ τ ∗U† is diagonal.) The square roots of the eigenvalues of τ τ ∗ are the same as the eigenvalues of R, so that condition
(12) is fulﬁlled as long as the diagonalizing matrix U is chosen in such a way
that the numbers λi appear in their proper order. Thus one can always ﬁnd a decomposition with the desired property. It is interesting to note that the vectors |xi of this decomposition are right-eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian matrix ρρ˜. One can see this by writing ρ as i |xi xi| and using Eq. (12). We could in fact have used this property to give an alternative speciﬁcation of the ensemble {|xi }.

6

Our second decomposition of ρ, which we label {|yi }, i = 1, . . . , n, is hardly diﬀerent from the ﬁrst:

|y1 = |x1 ; (14)
|yj = i|xj for j = 1.
It is indeed physically equivalent to the ﬁrst decomposition, but the phase factors will become important shortly when we take linear combinations of these vectors.
The decomposition {|yi } typically does not have a small average entanglement, but it does have a property that will make it useful for ﬁnding an optimal ensemble. In order to express this property, let us deﬁne the “preconcurrence” c of a pure state |ψ to be

c(ψ) =

ψ|ψ˜ ψ|ψ

,

(15)

where we have allowed for the possibility that |ψ may be subnormalized. Note that the preconcurrence is the same as the concurrence of Eq. (7) but without the absolute value sign. The decomposition {|yi } is special in that its average preconcurrence has the value C(ρ) of Eq. (10). To see this, recall that the probability of the state |yi in the decomposition is yi|yi , so that the average preconcurrence is

c=

i

yi|yi

yi|y˜i yi|yi

=

i

yi|y˜i .

(16)

The sum can be evaluated immediately from Eqs. (12) and (14), yielding c = λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4 = C(ρ). Here we have used the fact that if n < 4, the numbers λi with i > n are all zero.
We would like to ﬁnd a decomposition that, like {|yi }, has c = C(ρ), but which also has the property that the preconcurrence (and hence the concurrence) of each individual state is equal to C(ρ). It would then follow immediately that the average entanglement is E(C(ρ)), since this would be the entanglement of each state in the decomposition. In seeking such a decomposition, we will conﬁne ourselves to transformations that leave the average preconcurrence unchanged, and use these transformations to adjust the individual preconcurrences until they are all the same. The result will be our ﬁnal decomposition of ρ.

7

Now, any decomposition with n elements can be written in terms of the states |yi via the equation

n
|zi = Vi∗j|yj ,
j=1

(17)

where V is an n × n unitary matrix. The average preconcurrence of the ensemble {|zi } is

c = zi|z˜i = (V Y V T )ii = Tr (V Y V T ),

(18)

i

i

where Y is the real diagonal matrix deﬁned by Yij = yi|y˜j . Thus the average preconcurrence is unchanged by any real unitary matrix V (that is, any orthogonal matrix), since in that case V T = V −1 and the trace in
Eq. (18) is preserved.

Even restricting ourselves to orthogonal matrices, we retain more than

enough freedom to make the preconcurrences of the individual states equal. One way to do this is as follows. First, select the two states |yi with the largest and smallest values of the preconcurrence. Since the set {|yi } has the correct average preconcurrence, either all the preconcurrences are already equal to C(ρ), or else the largest one is too large and the smallest one is too small (typically negative). In the latter case, consider the set of positivedeterminant orthogonal transformations that act only on these two extreme states as in Eq. (17), changing them into new states that we call |za and |zb . (This set of transformations is simply the one-parameter set of rotations in two dimensions. It is worth emphasizing, however, that we are not using them to rotate the vector space; rather, we are directly forming new linear combinations of the two speciﬁed states. The other states |yi are not changed.) Among this set of transformations is one that simply interchanges the two extreme states and thus interchanges their preconcurrences. Therefore, by continuity there must exist an intermediate transformation that makes the preconcurrence of |za equal to C(ρ). Perform this transformation, thereby ﬁxing one element of the ensemble to have the correct concurrence. Next, consider the remaining n − 1 states, that is, |zb and the remaining |yi s, and perform the same operation on them. Continuing in this way, one ﬁnally ar-

rives at a set of states all having concurrence equal to C(ρ). This we take to be our ﬁnal decomposition {|zi }, which, as we have argued above, achieves

8

the claimed minimum average entanglement E(C(ρ)). Thus the value of entanglement given in our formula (9) can always be attained, at least for the case in which λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4 ≥ 0.
We now wish to show that no decomposition of ρ has a smaller average entanglement. For this it is enough to show that no decomposition has a smaller average concurrence: the average entanglement cannot be less than E( C ) because of the convexity of the function E. Now, the average concurrence of a general decomposition is given by an equation similar to Eq. (18) but with an absolute value sign:

C = |(V Y V T )ii|.

(19)

i

Here V is an m × n matrix whose n columns are orthonormal vectors. The

dimension m of these vectors can be arbitrarily large, since the decomposition

may consist of an arbitrarily large number of pure states (though prior results

guarantee that one need not consider values of m larger than sixteen [16]). In

terms of the components of V and Y , we can write the average concurrence

as

C=

(Vij)2Yjj .

ij

(20)

To obtain the desired lower bound on this sum, we need use only the fact that i |(Vij)2| = 1. That is, we can show that for any complex numbers αij such that i |αij| = 1, we have

αijYjj ≥ λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4.
ij

(21)

The proof is straightforward: ﬁrst note that there is no loss of generality in taking each αi1 to be real and positive. (The phases of the other αijs can be changed to compensate.) Then we can say

i | j αij Yjj| ≥ | ij αijYjj| = |λ1 − nj=2( i αij )λj| ≥ λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4
= C(ρ).

(22)

9

(Again we are using the fact that any λj with j > n is zero.) Thus no decomposition of ρ can achieve an average concurrence lower than C(ρ) or an average entanglement lower than E(C(ρ)).
There remains one case to consider, namely, density matrices for which λ1−λ2 −λ3 −λ4 < 0. For these density matrices our formula predicts that the entanglement should be zero, that is, that there should be a decomposition of ρ into unentangled pure states. To show that this is indeed the case, we again start with the decomposition {|xi }, i = 1, . . . , n, of Eq. (12). If n is equal to 3—the values n = 1 and n = 2 are not possible for the case we are now considering—it is convenient to supplement this set with a dummy state |x4 equal to the zero vector. From the complete set we directly form our ﬁnal decomposition {|zi }:

|z1

=

1 2

(eiθ1

|x1

+ eiθ2 |x2

+ eiθ3 |x3

+ eiθ4 |x4 )

|z2

=

1 2

(eiθ1

|x1

+ eiθ2 |x2

− eiθ3 |x3

− eiθ4 |x4 )

|z3

=

1 2

(eiθ1

|x1

− eiθ2 |x2

+ eiθ3 |x3

− eiθ4 |x4 )

|z4

=

1 2

(eiθ1

|x1

− eiθ2 |x2

− eiθ3|x3

+ eiθ4 |x4 ),

where the phase factors are chosen so that

(23)

e2iθj λj = 0.
j

(24)

Such phase factors can always be found when λ1 < λ2 + λ3 + λ4 (λ1 being the largest of the four numbers as always). The condition (24) together with the property (12) of the set {|xi } guarantee that each state |zi has zero concurrence and hence zero entanglement. This completes the proof of the formula (9).
Our formula makes possible the easy evaluation of entanglement of formation for a pair of qubits, and should thus facilitate the investigation of any number of questions concerning entanglement. However, there remains a very basic question concerning the interpretation of the entanglement of formation that has not yet been resolved. For any pure state |ψ of a bipartite system, the entanglement E(ψ) deﬁned in Eq. (2) has a very simple and elegant interpretation [17]: if two separated observers Alice and Bob start out with no shared entanglement, then in order for them to create many pairs in the state |ψ , such that Alice ends up with one member of each pair

10

and Bob has the other, it is necessary that for each pair produced, at least E(ψ) qubits must pass across an imaginary plane separating Alice and Bob; moreover, as the number of pairs approaches inﬁnity, the number of transmitted qubits needed per pair can be made arbitrarily close to E(ψ). That is, E(ψ) measures the amount of quantum information that must be exchanged between Alice and Bob in order to create the state |ψ . It seems likely that one can apply the same interpretation to the entanglement of formation of a mixed state [6], but this conclusion depends on a property of E(ρ) that has not yet been demonstrated [18]. The question is whether E(ρ) is additive, that is, whether, if Alice and Bob have n pairs in the state ρ, the entanglement of formation of that whole system is exactly n times the entanglement of formation of a single pair and not less. In mathematical terms, the issue is whether E(ρ⊗n) = nE(ρ). It is conceivable that the formula proved in this Letter will help to settle this question in the case of qubits, but more likely an entirely diﬀerent and more general argument will have to be found. If it is determined that E(ρ) is indeed additive, then this ﬁnding will considerably strengthen the physical interpretation of our formula.
