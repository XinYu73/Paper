atoms, 2.757 and 2.759 A. in MoFa and TaF~ respectively, is not inconsistent with the accepted value of 1.36 A. for the fluorine ionic radius, but since the metal atoms will probably force the non-metal atoms apart, the effective size of the fluorine atoms in these structures cannot be deduced from their distances of closest approach.

The Crystal Structure of Vanadium Trifluoride, VF 3

BY K. H. JACK AND V. GUTMANN* Chemistry Department, King's College, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, En(jland

(Received 14 September 1950)

The unit cell of vanadium trifluoride, VFs, is rhombohedral with dimensions a - 5 . 3 7 3 + 0-002 A., a = 57-52 _+0.03°. The structure places atoms in the following special positions of space group R~c:

2 V atoms at 0, 0, 0; ½, ½, ½, and

6 F atoms at + (x, ½- x, ¼); _+(½- x, ¼, x) ; +_(¼, x, ½- x),

with x=-0.145_+ 0.015 Direct experimental evidence shows that the structural unit is not the lmimolecular rhombohedron proposed by some workers for the isomorphous FeFa, CoFa, RhF 3 and PdF a. Preliminary observations indicate that CoF3 has a bimoleeular unit cell and is isostructural with VF a. The VF s structure is not identical either to that of A1F3 or to that of the ScF3, MoFa and TaF8 group, but has relationships with each of these structure types. Almost regular octahedra of fluorine atoms, each with a vanadium atom at its centre, are joined by sharing corners only. The fluorine atoms are not close-packed, and although their arrangement approximates to a hexagonal close-packing rather than to a cubic close-packing, it can be derived from the latter by relatively small atomic movements and by omission of atoms from certain sites. Principal interatomic

distances are

V-V--3.73; F-F-2.74 and 2.75; V-F-1.95A.

Introduction
Vanadium triituoride, VFa, was first prepared by Ruff & IAckfett (1911) by the action of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride on vanadium trichloride at red heat. The present X-ray work is the first on this fluoride and was carried out on pure specimens obtained in a recent chemical investigation (Emel6us & Gutmann, 1949) with which one of us was associated.
Preliminary observations suggested that VFa is isostructural with the trifluorides of iron, cobalt, rhodium and palladium, but since the structures of these are not yet fully established (see Wyckoff, 1948, section 1, chap. 5, text p. 13) a complete investigation of the vanadium compound seemed desirable. The structures proposed for FeFa, CoFa, RhF a and PdF a by Ebert

(1931) (Strukturbericht, 1937 a, b) were based solely upon spatial and symmetry considerations and are found to be incompatible with the observed intensities of X-ray reflexions. All observed reflexions were indexed on a rhombohedral cell containing only one molecule, but the proposed structure requires a larger bimoleeular unit cell, space group R3c, the dimensions of which are given in Table 1. The given parameters, i.e.
2 metal atoms at 0, 0, 0; ½, ½, ½, and
6 F atoms at + (x, ½ - x , ¼); + ( ½ - x , ¼, x);
+ (¼,x, l - x ) ,
with x=--!~, indicate a slightly distorted hexagonal close-packing of the fluorine atoms with the metal atoms occupying certain octahedral interstices and forming a rhombohedrally distorted simple-cubic superlattiee. The structure of aluminium trifluoride has been

established beyond reasonable doubt by Ketelaar (1933), who claimed that it was probably isomorphous with the FeF a group of fluorides. The bimolecular unit cell of A1F8, space group R32, contains
2 A1 atoms at _+(u, u, u), with u=0-237,
3 F atoms at 0, v, ~; v, ~, 0; ~, 0, v, with v - 0 . 4 3 0 ,
and
3 F atoms at ½, w, ~ ; w, vU, ½; ~, ½, w, with w - 0.070.
These parameters place the fluorine atoms in considerably distorted hexagonal close-packing. The FoFa structure proposed by Ebert may be referred to the less symmetrical space group R32 with parameters u(Fe)=0.250, v(F)=0.333, and w(F)=0.167, which differ quite markedly from Ketelaar's A1Fa values. From spatial considerations, a suggestion was made by Wooster (1933) that the group of transition element trifluorides had distorted ReOa structures. This was shown to be true by Nowacki (1939) for scandium trifluoride, which has a rhombohedral unit cell (pseudocubic; see Table 1), space group R32, containing
1 Sc at 0, 0, 0, and
3 F at ½, x, ~; x, ~, ½; ~, ½, x,
with x = 0.027 + 0-003. The ScF3 structure is a slightly distorted form of the MoF3 and TaF3 structures (Gutmann & Jack, 1951) in which the fluorine atoms have a cubic close-packing. Although Wooster's and Nowacki's suggestion has been widely quoted (e.g. see Wells, 1945, p. 275), Wyckoff (1948, section 1, chap. 5, text p. 11) concludes t h a t it is not certain whether the correct structural units for the trifluorides are the unimolecular pseudo-cubes or the larger bimolecular rhombohedral cells.
In the present investigation, direct evidence obtained by the use of monochromatic X-radiation shows that the contents of the rhombohedral unit cell of vanadium trifuoride are VgF6. Each vanadium atom is at the centre of an almost regular octahedron of six fluorine atoms which is joined to similar co-ordination octahedra by sharing corners only. The fluorine atoms are not close-packed and their arrangement is not identical with t h a t of A1Fa nor with the various fluorine atom arrange-

ments for FeFa, CoFa, RhF a and PdF a proposed by previous workers and based upon inadequate data.
Experimental
Preliminary powder photographs obtained with filtered Cu Ka radiation showed a high background intensity due to fluorescent X-radiation. All measurements were therefore made on negatives obtained with crystalreflected Cr Ka radiation (~, 2.28962; a~, 2.29352 A.) from a lithium fuoride monochromator. Observed and calculated intensities and unit-cell dimensions were found by methods previously described (Gutmann & Jack, 1951).
Results
Reflexions observed on 19 cm. powder photographs of VFataken with filtered Cu Ka radiation were all indexed on a unimolecular rhombohedral unit cell of dimensions a--3.729 A., a=87.80 °. With Cr K s monochromatic radiation the photographs had a low background intensity and this, together with the increased resolution due to the longer X-ray wave-length, disclosed additional reflexions which could not be indexed on the simple cell. As shown in Table 2, all reflexions were finally indexed on a unit cell of dimensions
a = 5.373 + 0.002 A., a = 57.52 +_0.03 °,
and with contents VgF6; observed density 3.36 (Ruff & Lickfett, 1911 ), calculated density 3.46 g.cm.-a. General considerations indicated that it was necessary to consider only the space groups R32 (cf. AlFa; Ketelaar, 1933) and R-3c (cf. FeFa; Strulcturbericht, 1937a, b). Excellent agreement (see Table 2) was obtained between observed and calculated intensities by placing the atoms in the following positions of R3c:
2 V atoms a t 0, 0, 0; ½, ½, ½, and 6 F a t o m s a t _+(x, ½ - x , ~ ) ; + (½-x, l, x) ; +(¼, x, ½-x),
with x = - 0 . 1 4 5 + 0.015. For comparison with A1Fa the structure may be referred to space group R32, in which case the origin is shifted by (~, 1, ~) and the atomic coordinates become
2 V atoms at + (u, u, u), with u = 0.250,
3 F atoms at 0, v, ~; v, V, 0; ~, 0, v, with v - 0 . 3 9 5 ,
3 F atoms at ½, w, w; w, w, ½; ~, ½, w, with w=0.105.

Discussion of the VF3 structure and its relationship with other trifluoride structures
The VF8 structure consists of alternate and regularly spaced planes of vanadium and planes of fluorine atoms perpendicular to the [111] direction. I n A1Fa the fluorine planes are equally spaced, but the aluminium planes are not. This difference between the two fluorides is illustrated in Fig. 1. Each fluorine atom of V F a is surrounded in its own plane by six other fluorine atoms, four at 2.75 A. and two at 3.54 A., and has six fluorine neighbours in adjacent fluorine planes, four (two in the plane above and two below) at 2-74 A. and two (one above and one below) at 3.08 A. Each vanadium atom occupies the centre of an octahedron formed by six fluorine neighbours--three in the plane above and three below, and each at a distance of 1.94 A. Each octahedron is almost regular, having six of its edges 2.75 A.

It should be noted in Table 2 that the six X-ray reflexions marked with an asterisk have h + k+ 1 odd and therefore cannot be accounted for by a unimolecular rhombohedral unit cell. Only two of these, the relatively weak (320) and (421) reflexions, do not overlap with reflexions for which h + k + 1is even. If this is also true for iron, cobalt, rhodium and palladium trifluorides, it is not surprising that there has been some confusion as to their true structural units. The remaining four 'bimolecular' reflexions are strong and overlap very weak 'unimolecular' reflexions. In previous work (Ebert, 1931) such reflexions have been incorrectly indexed so that the structures proposed are necessarily inconsistent with the experimental data. Using the more refined X-ray techniques of the present work, preliminary observations indicate that cobalt trifluoride is isostructural with vanadium trifluoride.

and the remaining two 2.74 A. It is joined to other co-ordination octahedra by sharing corners only. The vanadium atoms form a rhombohedrally distorted simple cubic lattice (~ = 87.8 °) in which each atom is at 3.73 A. from its six metal-atom neighbours. Fig. 2 is a projection of the structure in the [111] direction and shows twelve successive planes. The arrangement of fluorine atoms may be regarded as a considerably distorted hexagonal close-packing with particularly large interstices at ¼, ¼, ¼ and ~, ~, ~. The centres of these 'holes' are co-ordinated by nine fluorine atoms, six at 2.74 A. and three at 2.04 A. Thus each 'hole' is almost large enough to accommodate an additional fluorine atom. The structure therefore contains only threequarters of the number of fluorine atoms which might be expected for perfect close-packing. This feature is analogous with that found in MoF3 and TaFa in which only three-quarters of the possible cubic close-packed fluorine sites are filled. Indeed, the VF3 structure may be regarded as a distorted ReOs pseudo-cube with the fluorine atoms displaced from the mid-points of the cell edges by 0.54 A. The movements necessary to bring the atoms of three successive fluorine planes into these cubic close-packed sites are indicated in Fig. 2 by short arrows.

In conclusion, the structure of vanadium trifluoride is not identical either to that of A1F3 or to that of the ScF3, MoFa and TaF 3 group, but has relationships with each of these structure types. Interatomic distances in the trifluorides of known structure are listed in Table 4.
