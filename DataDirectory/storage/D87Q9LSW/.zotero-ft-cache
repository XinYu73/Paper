Abstract

The melting curve of aluminum is determined up to 300 GPa using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The calculations are based on density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation. We simulate the melting with two methods, the one-phase or heat until it melts and the two-phase approaches. The first one corresponds to a homogeneous melting, while the second one involves a heterogeneous melting of the materials. This conceptual difference gives rise to melting temperatures which can noticeably differ. As expected we observe a melting temperature overestimation in the one-phase approach compared to the two-phase approach. To reduce this overheating we use the hysteresis and the Z method which try to combine the advantage of both techniques. We finally compare our theoretical data with experiments and we discuss the pertinence and the use of the methods.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.
