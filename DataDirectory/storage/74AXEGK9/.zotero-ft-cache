Abstract

We study the robustness of multiparty entanglement under local decoherence, modeled by partially depolarizing channels acting independently on each subsystem. Surprisingly, we find that the robustness of (GHZ) entanglement increases with the number of qubits. An n -qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state can stand more than 55% local depolarization in the limit → n ∞ . GHZ states are more robust than other generic states of three and four qubits. We also study spin-squeezed states in the limit → n ∞ and find that they too can stand considerable local depolarization.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.
