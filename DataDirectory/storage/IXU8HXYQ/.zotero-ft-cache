Abstract

Work on orthoferrite perovskites (e.g., GdFeO 3 ) shows that AB O 3 oxides with A and B magnetic cations present novel behaviors (e.g., magnetoelectric) not possible when only one cation has spin. Unfortunately, the magnetic A cations are usually lanthanides whose 4 f electrons interact weakly, restricting the most interesting effects to low temperatures. Here we explore the possibility of having both A and B sites occupied by 3 d transition metals, by running a systematic first-principles investigation of 81 compositions, considering the polymorphs most likely to be stable in bulk or thin-film forms (perovskite, corundum derivatives). We predict specific compounds to be multiferroics at high temperature, multiferroics with large magnetic moments, “multiferroic metals” (i.e., as the much-sought “polar metals,” but also magnetic), and ferromagnetic insulators. Our results offer a compelling panoramic of these compounds and the possibilities they offer, providing plenty of directions for further original research, both theoretical and experimental.

    Spin orders discussed in this work. (a), (b): Sketch of the perovskite (PK), -type (LN-type), or -like (AO-like) lattices (a), with the cations numbered in (b). The FM order corresponds to all spins being parallel, in both the and sublattices. The FiM order corresponds to having all cations with spin up, and all cations with spin down. The AFM1 order corresponds to having cations , and with spin up, and all others with spin down. Finally, the AFM2 order corresponds to having the , and cations with spin up, and all others with spin down. (c), (d): Sketch of the I lattice (c), with the cations numbered in (d). The FM and FiM orders are defined as above. The AFM1 order corresponds to having the , and cations with spin up, and all others with spin down. The AFM2 order corresponds to having the , and cations with spin up, and all others with spin down.

    Polymorphs obtained as lowest-energy solutions. (a) Perovskite lattice with a “” pattern of rotations of the groups (symmetry , see text), as it occurs in ; the view is along the axis of in-phase rotations. (b) Perovskite lattice with stronger “” tilts, as it occurs, e.g., in ; a polar distortion, roughly perpendicular to the plane of the figure (i.e., along the axis of the rotations) reduces the symmetry to . (c) Perovskite lattice with “” tilts and a polar distortion along the tilting axis (elongated direction of the shown cell), as it occurs in ( space group). When the tilts are very large, the and cations acquire similar octahedral oxygen environments, and we have a -like lattice. (d) Corundum structure of , which is essentially obtained from the lattice for same and cations. (e) Ilmenite structure, as that of .

    Summary of our results. Panel (a) shows the materials that are predicted to present the most interesting properties, grouped in the four indicated categories. Panel (b) gives further detail on the most stable solutions obtained for each of the investigated compositions. As shown in the legend, we indicate the lowest-energy polymorph (PK-, LN-, or I-type), whether it is polar, whether it presents a net magnetization, and whether it is an insulator or (half)metal. Note that, whenever we have an LN-type solution with same and cations, it actually reduces to the AO corundum structure. Note that, because the and sites are crystallographically rather similar in the dominant corundum-like structures, this figure is approximately symmetric upon – swapping.

    Computed partial density of states of some of the materials highlighted in the text. (a) , a candidate to be MEM at . (b) , a candidate to be MEM with large remnant magnetic moment. (c) , a candidate to be a “multiferroic metal” at . (d) , a prospective low-temperature ferromagnetic insulator.
