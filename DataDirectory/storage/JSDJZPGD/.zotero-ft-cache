Local Unitary Equivalence of Multipartite Pure States

(Received 20 October 2009; published 14 January 2010)
Necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient conditions for the equivalence of arbitrary n-qubit pure quantum states under local unitary (LU) operations are derived. First, an easily computable standard form for multipartite states is introduced. Two generic states are shown to be LU equivalent iff their standard forms coincide. The LUequivalence problem for nongeneric states is solved by presenting a systematic method to determine the LU operators (if they exist) which interconvert the two states.

Multipartite states occur in many applications of quantum information, like one-way quantum computing, quantum error correction, and quantum secret sharing [1,2]. Furthermore, the theory of many-body states plays also an important role in other Ô¨Åelds of physics [3]. The existence of those practical and abstract applications is due to the subtle properties of multipartite entangled states. Thus, one of the main goals in quantum-information theory is to gain a better understanding of the nonlocal properties of quantum states. Whereas the bipartite case is well understood, the multipartite case is much more complex. Even though a big theoretical effort has been undertaken where several entanglement measures for multipartite states have been introduced [4], different classes of entangled states have been identiÔ¨Åed [5], and a normal form of multipartite states has been presented [6], we are far from completely understanding the nonlocal properties of multipartite states [7].
One way to gain insight into the entanglement properties of quantum states is to consider their interconvertibility. That is, given two states j√âi, j√ài the question is whether or not j√âi can be transformed into j√ài by local operations [7]. One particularly interesting case, which is also investigated in this Letter, is the local unitary (LU) equivalence of multipartite states. We say that a n-partite state j√âi is LU equivalent to j√ài (j√âi ‚ÄôLU j√ài) if there exist local unitary operators U1 √Å √Å √Å Un such that j√âi ¬º U1  √Å √Å √Å  Unj√ài. Note that two states which are LU equivalent are equally useful for any kind of application and they possess precisely the same amount of entanglement. This is why understanding the interconvertibility of quantum states by LU operations is part of the solution to the more general problem of characterizing the different types of entangled quantum states.
Several approaches have been used to tackle this longstanding problem. For instance in [8] a standard form for 3qubit states has been presented. For n-qubit states the socalled local polynomial invariants have been introduced [9]. However, even though it is known that it is sufÔ¨Åcient to consider only a Ô¨Ånite set of them, this complete Ô¨Ånite set is known only for very few simple cases.

Here, we derive necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient conditions for the existence of LU operations which transform two n-qubit states into each other. For generic states, states where none of the single qubit reduced states is completely mixed, the conditions can be easily computed. For arbitrary n-qubit states a systematic method to determine the unitaries (in case they exist) which interconvert the states is presented.
The sequel of the Letter is organized as follows. First, we introduce a standard form of multipartite states, which we use in order to derive easily computable necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient conditions for the LU equivalence of generic multipartite states. As in the bipartite case, it is shown that two generic states are LU equivalent iff their standard forms coincide. For nongeneric states it is shown that whenever one of the single qubit reduced states is not completely mixed, the problem of LU equivalence of n-qubit states can be reduced to the one of (n √Ä 1)-qubit states. Then, a systematic method to determine the local unitaries (if they exist) which interconvert two arbitrary states is presented. It is shown that the states are LU equivalent iff there exists a solution to a Ô¨Ånite set of equations. The number of variables involved in those equations depends on the entanglement properties of the states. The case with the largest number of variables occurs for the sometimes-called maximally entangled states of n qubits, where any bipartition of dn=2e qubits is maximally entangled with the rest. It is known, however, that only for certain values of n such states exist [10]. The power of this method is illustrated by considering several examples.
Throughout this Letter the following notation is used. By X, Y, Z we denote the Pauli operators. The subscript of an operator will always denote the system it is acting on, or the system it is describing. The reduced states of system i1 √Å √Å √Å ik of j√âi (j√ài) will always be denoted by i1√Å√Å√Åik (i1√Å√Å√Åik ) respectively, i.e., i1√Å√Å√Åik ¬º tr:i1√Å√Å√Å:ik √∞j√âih√âj√û. We denote by i the classical bit string (i1 √Å √Å √Å in) with ik 2 f0; 1g 8 k 2 f1 √Å √Å √Å ng and jii  ji1 √Å √Å √Å ini denotes the computational basis. Normalization factors as well as the tensor product symbol will be omitted whenever it does not cause any confusion.

Let us start by introducing a unique standard form of
multipartite states (see also [11]). Let j√âi be a n-qubit state. As a Ô¨Årst step we apply local unitaries Ui1 such that all the single qubit reduced states of the state j√âti ¬º U11  √Å √Å √Å Un1j√âi are diagonal in the computational basis, i.e., tr:i√∞j√âtih√âtj√û ¬º Di ¬º diag√∞1i ; 2i √û. We call any such decomposition trace decomposition of the state j√âi. A

sorted trace decomposition is then deÔ¨Åned as a trace decomposition with 1i ! 2i . Note that transforming a state into its sorted trace decomposition, which we will denote
by j√âsti in the following, can be easily done by computing the spectral decomposition of all the single qubit reduced

states. The sorted trace decomposition of a generic state j√âi with i √û 1 8 i is unique up to local phase gates. That is U1 √Å √Å √Å Unj√âsti is a sorted trace decomposition of j√âi iff (up to a global phase 0) Ui ¬º Zi√∞i√û  diag√∞1; eii√û. In order to make the sorted trace decomposition of generic

states unique we impose phases i, i 2 f0 √Å √Å √Å ng.

the and

deÔ¨Åne the set S ¬º fi: i √û 0g and S" denotes the set of

the Ô¨Årst (in lexicographic order) linearly independent vec-

tors in S [12]. The global phase 0 is chosen to make i0 real and positive where i0 ¬º 0 in case 0 √û 0 else i0
denotes the Ô¨Årst (in lexicographic order) linearly dependent

vector in S. After that, the n phases are chosen to make the coefÔ¨Åcients ei0i for i 2 S" real and positive [13]. The sodeÔ¨Åned standard form, which will be denoted by j√âsi in the following, is unique. If i ¬º 1, for some system i, the standard form can be similarly deÔ¨Åned [11], however it will

not be unique then. Because of the deÔ¨Ånition any state is

LU equivalent to its standard form [14].

We employ now the standard form to derive a criterion

for the LU equivalence of generic multipartite states. First of all note that j√âi ‚ÄôLU j√ài iff j√âsi ‚ÄôLU j√àsi. Using then that the standard form is unique we obtain the following

theorem.
Theorem 1.‚ÄîLet j√âi be an n qubit state with i √û 1 8 i. Then j√âi ‚ÄôLU j√ài iff the standard form of j√âi is equivalent to the standard form of j√ài, i.e., j√âsi ¬º j√àsi.
Thus, similarly to the bipartite case, two generic states

In order to study now the nongeneric cases, we will

rewrite the necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient condition derived

above. For a generic state, j√âi it is easy to verify that

j√âsi ¬º j√àsi iff there exists a bit string k ¬º √∞k1 √Å √Å √Å kn√û,

Let us now consider the nongeneric case. Obviously, two

arbitrary states j√âi, j√ài are LU equivalent iff there exist local unitaries V"k, W" k, a bit string k, and phases i such that Eq. (1) is fulÔ¨Ålled. We will show now how V"k, W" k can
be determined by imposing necessary conditions of

LU equivalence.

First of all, we note that for any state j√âi with i √û 1 for some system i, ki as well as V"i and W" i can be easily

determined as follows. If j√âi ‚ÄôLU j√ài then all the reduced

states must be LU equivalent, in particular Di ¬º

to the

exist two phases i and 0 and local unitaries Uj such that

Hence,

if

there

is

one system where the reduced state is not proportional to

the identity then we can reduce the problem of LU

equivalence of n-qubit states to the one of (n √Ä 1)-qubit

states. This statement can be easily generalized to the case

where more than one single qubit reduced state is not

completely mixed.

Let us now consider the more complicated case, where

some i ¬º 1. There, it is obviously no longer possible to determine V"i, W" i by imposing the necessary condition of LU equivalence, i ¬º UiiUiy. However, we will show next which necessary condition can be used in order to

determine them. Before we do so, we explain the problem

which might occur if i ¬º 1 by considering a simple example. Let j√âi and j√ài denote two states with 12 ¬º 12 ¬º 1 √Ä j√â√Äih√â√Äj, for some  √û 0. Then we Ô¨Ånd

Thus, the unitary U2 depends on U1. Or, stated differently, W" 2 (and 2) depends on U1 ¬º ¬ΩZ1√∞1√ûX1k1 W" 1¬äy in Eq. (1), where we set V1 ¬º V2 ¬º 1. In general we might neither be able to determine the phase 2, nor W" 2 as a function of U1 alone. However, the next lemma shows that any W" k can be determined as a function of a few unitaries and V"k can always be determined directly form the state j√ài. We will see that

the number of unitaries which are required to deÔ¨Åne W" k

depends on the entanglement properties of the state.

j

Note that the proof of Lemma 3 is constructive. The idea

was to impose the necessary condition for LU equivalence

given in Eq. (3) for any l tuples i, j. Since the 2 √Ç 2

matrices occurring in this equation are Hermitian, one

can, similarly to the previous cases, determine the unitaries V"k, W" k by diagonalizing these matrices. In contrast to before we will Ô¨Ånd here, that W" k might depend on U1 √Å √Å √Å Ul.
We use now Lemma 3 to present a constructive method

to compute all local unitaries as functions of a few varia-

bles. If some unitary Ui cannot be determined in this way, we write Ui ¬º e√ÄiiZi e√ÄiiXi e√ÄiiZi (up to a phase) and choose without loss of generality V"i ¬º 1, ki ¬º 0, and

W" i ¬º eiiXi eiiZi in Eq. (1). We will say then that we

consider Ui as a variable. The constructive method to compute now V"k and W" k in

Eq. (1) is as follows: (1) If there exists a system i such that

compute

V" i ,

W" i

system k with ik √û i  1 using Lemma 3. (2) For all systems i for which i √û 1 apply the unitaries W" i (V"i) to

j√âi (j√ài) respectively and measure system i in the com-

putational basis thereby reducing the number of systems

[see Eq. (2)]. After this step we have i ¬º 1 8 i. Then we continue as follows: (3) Consider the two-qubit reduced

states: (3a) There exist systems i, j such that ij √û 1. Without loss of generality we choose i ¬º 1, consider U1 as variable, and set V" 1 ¬º 1, k1 ¬º 0 and W" 1 ¬º ei1X1 ei1Z1 . Then, compute V"j and W" j√∞U1√û using Lemma 3 for any
system j with 1j √û 1. Let us denote by J2 the set of
systems j, for which 1j √û 1. (3b) If there exists no system
i, j such that ij √û 1 consider U1 and U2 as variables and set V" i ¬º 1, ki ¬º 0 and W" i ¬º eiiXi eiiZi , for i ¬º 1, 2. Furthermore, set J2 ¬º f2g. (4) Consider the three-qubit
reduced states: (4a) There exists a system k such that 1jk √û 1j  1 for some j 2 J2. Compute V"k and W" k√∞U1; Uj√û using Lemma 3 for any system k with 1jk √û 1j  1. (4b) If there exists no system k such that 1jk √û 1j  1 include U3 as variable. (5) Continue in this way

until all unitaries are either determined as functions of a

few unitaries, or are free parameters. If at some point it is not possible to choose V"k or W" k unitary, e.g., if the eigen-
values of the operators occurring in Eq. (3) do not coincide,

the states are not LU equivalent. Once all unitaries V"i are determined and all unitaries W" i
are determined as functions of a few variables, we have that

j√âi ‚ÄôLU j√ài iff there exists a bit string k and phases figni¬º0, such that Eq. (1) is fulÔ¨Ålled. In order to check the existence of the local phase gates in Eq. (1) (for some

bit string k), we use Lemma 2. It is important to note

here that the state on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) is

completely determined, thus, the set K√â in Lemma 2 can be determined and therefore this lemma can be applied.

The states are LU equivalent iff the conditions in Lemma 2

are fulÔ¨Ålled for some bit string k. The unitaries which

interconvert the states are, up to the symmetry of the

states, uniquely determined and are given by Ui ¬º

volves the largest number of variables, occurs for maxi-

maximally entangled). In this case, which exists only for

certain instances of n, we have dn=2e unitaries as variables.

i1 √Å √Å √Å il, system k is maximally entangled with the remaining systems. Thus, two states j√âi, j√ài with i1√Å√Å√Åil;k ¬º i1√Å√Å√Åil  1 and i1√Å√Å√Åil;k √û i1√Å√Å√Åil  1 can neither be LU equivalent nor possess the same entanglement. Hence, the method presented above suggests that in order to characterize the nonlocal properties of multipartite states, one should Ô¨Årst identify the class (as described above) to which the state belongs to and then determine within this class the entanglement of the state. It might well be that the different classes lead to different applications. For instance, the states used for error correction and oneway quantum computing have the property that all single qubit reduced states are completely mixed.
In order to illustrate the power of this method we consider Ô¨Årst the simplest examples of two and three-qubit states. The standard form of a two-qubit state is j√âi ¬º 1j00i √æ 2j11i. Thus, the method above tells us that if 1 √û 2, i.e., i √û 1, then j√âi ‚ÄôLU j√ài iff the Schmidt coefÔ¨Åcients i are the same. For 1 ¬º 2 it is straightforward to show that the unitaries Ui, which are obtained using the method above for the states j√à√æi  j00i √æ j11i and some LU-equivalent state V1V2j√à√æi are U1 ¬º V1W and U2 ¬º V2W√É for any unitary W. The reason why the unitaries Ui are not completely determined by Vi is due to the symmetry of j√à√æi. For three qubits the method is almost equally simple. First, we transform both states into their trace decomposition. If none of the reduced states is completely mixed, we simply compare their standard forms (Theorem 1). If there exists some i such that i √û 1, we know that Ui ¬º Z√∞i√û. We measure system i in the computational basis and are left with two two-qubit states [see Eq. (2)]. For the remaining case, where i ¬º 1 8 i it can be easily shown that j√âi is LU equivalent to the GHZ state, j√â0i ¬º j000i √æ j111i [17]. Even without using this fact also in this case the right unitaries can be directly computed using the presented method (for, details see [17]).
The LU-equivalence classes of up to 5-qubit states are investigated in [17]. We will show there, for instance, that for 4-qubit states with ij ¬º 1 for some i, j (which is the hardest class of states using the method presented above), the LU-equivalence class is determined by only three parameters. Thus, the entanglement of those states is completely determined by the fact that system ij is maximally entangled to the other two qubits and those three parameters, to which also an operational meaning will be given [17]. This example shows already that the method presented here does not only give necessary and sufÔ¨Åcient conditions for the LU equivalence of arbitrary multipartite states, but also leads to a new insight into their entanglement properties. Moreover, the results presented here lead also to a criterion of LU equivalence for certain mixed and also d-level states [17] and to conditions for the existence of more general operations transforming one state into the other, namely local operations and classical communica-

tion (LOCC). This is due to the fact that two multipartite states, having the same marginal one-party entropies, are either LU equivalent, or LOCC incomparable [19].

Kruszynska and B. Kraus, Phys. Rev. A 79, 052304 (2009). [12] We sort the vectors in S in lexicographic order and include the Ô¨Årst vector (√û0) in the set S". A subsequent vector is included in S" if it is linearly independent of the vectors in S". [13] If there are less than n linearly independent vectors in S, say k, then k phases can be deÔ¨Åned like that, the other phases leave the state invariant and can therefore be chosen arbitrarily. [14] Note that this standard form coincides for the simplest case of two qubits with the Schmidt decomposition [15] and can be generalized to d-level systems. [15] M. A. Nielsen and I. L.
