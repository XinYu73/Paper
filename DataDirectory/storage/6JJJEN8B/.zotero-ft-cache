of two subsystems is separable if its rA0 and rA00 are density matrices for

density matrix can be written the two subsystems, and the

positive weights wA satisfy wA ෇ 1. In this Letter, it is proved that a necessary condition for

separability is that a matrix, obtained by partial transposition of r, has only non-negative eigenvalues.

Some examples show that this criterion is more sensitive than Bell’s inequality for detecting quantum

inseparability. [S0031-9007(96)00911-8]

A striking quantum phenomenon is the inseparability of composite quantum systems. Its most famous example is the violation of Bell’s inequality, which may be detected if two distant observers, who independently measure subsystems of a composite quantum system, report their results to a common site where that information is analyzed [1]. However, even if Bell’s inequality is satisﬁed by a given composite quantum system, there is no guarantee that its state can be prepared by two distant observers who receive instructions from a common source. For this to be possible, the density matrix r has to be separable into a sum of direct products,

P where the positive weights wA satisfy wA ෇ 1, and where rA0 and rA00 are density matrices for the two subsystems. A separable system always satisﬁes Bell’s inequality, but the converse is not necessarily true [2– 5]. In this Letter, I shall derive a simple algebraic test, which is a necessary condition for the existence of the decomposition (1). I shall then give some examples showing that this criterion is more restrictive than Bell’s inequality, or than the a-entropy inequality [6].
The derivation of this separability condition is best done by writing the density matrix elements explicitly, with all their indices [1]. For example, Eq. (1) becomes

X

rmm,nn ෇ wA͑ rA0 ͒mn ͑ rA00͒mn .

Latin indices refer to the ﬁrst subsystem, Greek indices to the second one (the subsystems may have different dimensions). Note that this equation can always be satisﬁed if we replace the quantum density matrices by classical Liouville functions (and the discrete indices are replaced by canonical variables p and q). The reason is that the only constraint that a Liouville function has to satisfy is being non-negative. On the other hand, we want quantum density matrices to have non-negative eigenvalues, rather than non-negative elements, and the latter condition is more difﬁcult to satisfy.
Let us now deﬁne a new matrix,

smm,nn ϵ rnm,mn .

The Latin indices of r have been transposed, but not the

Greek ones. This is not a unitary transformation but,

nevertheless, the s matrix is Hermitian. When Eq. (1)

is valid, we have

Since the transposed matrices ͑rA0 ͒T ϵ ͑rA0 ͒‫ ء‬are nonnegative matrices with unit trace, they can also be
legitimate density matrices. It follows that none of

the eigenvalues of s is negative. This is a necessary condition for Eq. (1) to hold.
Note that the eigenvalues of s are invariant under separate unitary transformations, U0 and U00, of the bases used by the two observers. In such a case, r transforms
as

r °! ͑U0 ≠ U00͒r͑U0 ≠ U00͒y,

(5)

and we then have

s °! ͑U0T ≠ U00͒s͑U0T ≠ U00͒y,

(6)

which also is unitary transformation, leaving the eigenval-

ues of s invariant.

As

an

example,

consider

a

pair

of

spin-

1 2

particles

in a Werner state (an impure singlet), consisting of a

single fraction x and a random fraction ͑1 2 x͒ [7].

Note that the “random fraction” ͑1 2 x͒ also includes

singlets, mixed in equal proportions with the three triplet

components. We have

rmm,nn ෇ xSmm,nn 1 ͑1 2 x͒dmndmn͞4 , (7)

where the density matrix for a pure singlet is given by

and all the other components of S vanish. (The indices

0 and 1 refer to any two orthogonal states, such as “up”

and “down.”) A straightforward calculation shows that

s has three eigenvalues equal to ͑1 1 x͒͞4, and the

fourth eigenvalue is ͑1 2 3x͒͞4. This lowest eigenvalue

is

positive

if

x

,

1 3

,

and

the

separability

criterion

is

then

fulﬁlled. This result may be compapred with other criteria:

Bell’s inequality holds forpx , 1͞ 2, and the a-entropic

inequality [6] for x , 1͞ 3. These are, therefore, much

weaker tests for detecting inseparability than the condition

that was derived here.

In this particular case, it happens that this necessary

condition is also a sufﬁcient one. It is indeed known

that

if

x

,

1 3

it

is

possible

to

write

r

as

a

mixture

of

unentangled product states [8]. This result suggests that

the necessary condition derived above (s has no negative

eigenvalue) might also be sufﬁcient for any r. Some time

after this Letter was submitted for publication, a proof

of this conjecture was indeed obtained [9] for composite

systems having dimensions 2 3 2 and 2 3 3. However,

for higher dimensions, the present necessary condition

was shown not to be a sufﬁcient one.

As a second example, consider a mixed state introduced

by Gisin [5]. With the present notations, it consists

of a fraction x of the pure state aj01͘ 1 bj10͘ (with

jaj2 1 jbj2 ෇ 1), and fractions ͑1 2 x͒͞2 of the pure

states j00͘ and j11͘. The nonvanishing elements of r thus

are

r00,00 ෇ r11,11 ෇ ͑1 2 x͒͞2 ,

(9)

r01,01 ෇ xjaj2,

(10)

r10,10 ෇ xjbj2,

(11)

r01,10 ෇ r1‫ء‬0,01 ෇ xab‫ء‬.

(12)

It is easily seen that the s matrix has a negative determinant, and therefore a negative eigenvalue, when

x . ͑1 1 2jabj͒21.

(13)

This is a lower limit than the one for a violation of Bell’s inequality, which requires [5]

p

x . ͓1 1 2jabj ͑ 2 2 1͔͒21.

(14)

An even more striking example is the mixture of a singlet and a maximally polarized pair:

rmm,nn ෇ xSmm,nn 1 ͑1 2 x͒dm0dn0dm0dn0 . (15)
For any positive x, however small, this state is inseparable, because s has a negative eigenvalue ͑2x͞2͒. On the other hand, the Horodecki criterion [10] gives a very generous domain to the validity of Bell’s inequality: x # 0.8.
The weakness of Bell’s inequality as a test for inseparability is attributable to the fact that the only use made of the density matrix r is for computing the probabilities of the various outcomes of tests that may be performed on the subsystems of a single composite system. On the other hand, an experimental veriﬁcation of that inequality necessitates the use of many composite systems, all prepared in the same way. However, if many such systems are actually available, we may also test them collectively, for example, two by two, or three by three, etc., rather than one by one. If we do that, we must use, instead of r (the density matrix of a single system), a new density matrix, which is r ≠ r, or r ≠ r ≠ r, in a higher-dimensional space. It then turns out that there are some density matrices r that satisfy Bell’s inequality, but for which r ≠ r, or r ≠ r ≠ r, etc., violate that inequality [11].
This result raises a new question: Can we get stronger inseparability criteria by considering r ≠ r, or higher tensor products? It is easily seen that no further progress can be achieved in this way. If r is separable as in Eq. (1), so is r ≠ r. Moreover, the partly transposed matrix corresponding to r ≠ r simply is s ≠ s, so that if no eigenvalue of s is negative, then s ≠ s too has no negative eigenvalue.
I am grateful to R. Horodecki and R. Jozsa for pointing out that Eq. (4) could be used instead of a longer derivation that appeared in an earlier version of this
