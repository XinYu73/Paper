Student Solutions Manual for Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering, third edition
Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering, third edition, is a highly acclaimed undergraduate textbook that teaches all the mathematics needed for an undergraduate course in any of the physical sciences. As well as lucid descriptions of the topics and many worked examples, it contains over 800 exercises. New stand-alone chapters give a systematic account of the ‘special functions’ of physical science, cover an extended range of practical applications of complex variables, and give an introduction to quantum operators.
This solutions manual accompanies the third edition of Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering. It contains complete worked solutions to over 400 exercises in the main textbook, the odd-numbered exercises that are provided with hints and answers. The even-numbered exercises have no hints, answers or worked solutions and are intended for unaided homework problems; full solutions are available to instructors on a password-protected website, www.cambridge.org/9780521679718.

Preface
The second edition of Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering carried more than twice as many exercises, based on its various chapters, as did the ﬁrst. In the Preface we discussed the general question of how such exercises should be treated but, in the end, decided to provide hints and outline answers to all problems, as in the ﬁrst edition. This decision was an uneasy one as, on the one hand, it did not allow the exercises to be set as totally unaided homework that could be used for assessment purposes, but, on the other, it did not give a full explanation of how to tackle a problem when a student needed explicit guidance or a model answer. In order to allow both of these educationally desirable goals to be achieved, we have, in the third edition, completely changed the way this matter is handled. All of the exercises from the second edition, plus a number of additional ones testing the newly added material, have been included in penultimate subsections of the appropriate, sometimes reorganised, chapters. Hints and outline answers are given, as previously, in the ﬁnal subsections, but only to the odd-numbered exercises. This leaves all even-numbered exercises free to be set as unaided homework, as described below. For the four hundred plus odd-numbered exercises, complete solutions are available, to both students and their teachers, in the form of this manual; these are in addition to the hints and outline answers given in the main text. For each exercise, the original question is reproduced and then followed by a fully worked solution. For those original exercises that make internal reference to the text or to other (even-numbered) exercises not included in this solutions manual, the questions have been reworded, usually by including additional information, so that the questions can stand alone. Some further minor rewording has been included to improve the page layout. In many cases the solution given is even fuller than one that might be expected

PREFACE
of a good student who has understood the material. This is because we have aimed to make the solutions instructional as well as utilitarian. To this end, we have included comments that are intended to show how the plan for the solution is formulated and have provided the justiﬁcations for particular intermediate steps (something not always done, even by the best of students). We have also tried to write each individual substituted formula in the form that best indicates how it was obtained, before simplifying it at the next or a subsequent stage. Where several lines of algebraic manipulation or calculus are needed to obtain a ﬁnal result, they are normally included in full; this should enable the student to determine whether an incorrect answer is due to a misunderstanding of principles or to a technical error. The remaining four hundred or so even-numbered exercises have no hints or answers (outlined or detailed) available for general access. They can therefore be used by instructors as a basis for setting unaided homework. Full solutions to these exercises, in the same general format as those appearing in this manual (though they may contain references to the main text or to other exercises), are available without charge to accredited teachers as downloadable pdf ﬁles on the password-protected website http://www.cambridge.org/9780521679718. Teachers wishing to have access to the website should contact solutions@cambridge.org for registration details. As noted above, the original questions are reproduced in full, or in a suitably modiﬁed stand-alone form, at the start of each exercise. Reference to the main text is not needed provided that standard formulae are known (and a set of tables is available for a few of the statistical and numerical exercises). This means that, although it is not its prime purpose, this manual could be used as a test or quiz book by a student who has learned, or thinks that he or she has learned, the material covered in the main text. In all new publications, errors and typographical mistakes are virtually unavoidable, and we would be grateful to any reader who brings instances to our attention. Finally, we are extremely grateful to Dave Green for his considerable and continuing advice concerning typesetting in LATEX.

Preliminary algebra

Polynomial equations

1.1 It can be shown that the polynomial

g(x) = 4x3 + 3x2 − 6x − 1

has

turning

points

at

x

=

−1

and

x

=

1 2

and

three

real

roots

altogether.

Continue

an investigation of its properties as follows.

(a) Make a table of values of g(x) for integer values of x between −2 and 2.

Use it and the information given above to draw a graph and so determine

the roots of g(x) = 0 as accurately as possible.

(b) Find one accurate root of g(x) = 0 by inspection and hence determine precise

values for the other two roots.

(c) Show that f(x) = 4x3 + 3x2 − 6x − k = 0 has only one real root unless

−5

≤

k

≤

7 4

.

(a) Straightforward evaluation of g(x) at integer values of x gives the following table:
x −2 −1 0 1 2 g(x) −9 4 −1 0 31 (b) It is apparent from the table alone that x = 1 is an exact root of g(x) = 0 and so g(x) can be factorised as g(x) = (x − 1)h(x) = (x − 1)(b2x2 + b1x + b0). Equating the coeﬃcients of x3, x2, x and the constant term gives 4 = b2, b1 − b2 = 3, b0 − b1 = −6 and −b0 = −1, respectively, which are consistent if b1 = 7. To ﬁnd the two remaining roots we set h(x) = 0:
4x2 + 7x + 1 = 0.

The roots of this quadratic equation are given by the standard formula as

(c) When k = 1 (i.e. the original equation) the values of g(x) at its turning points,

x

and

x

are

respectively.

Thus

1.3 Investigate the properties of the polynomial equation
f(x) = x7 + 5x6 + x4 − x3 + x2 − 2 = 0,
by proceeding as follows.
(a) By writing the ﬁfth-degree polynomial appearing in the expression for f (x) in the form 7x5 + 30x4 + a(x − b)2 + c, show that there is in fact only one positive root of f(x) = 0.
(b) By evaluating f(1), f(0) and f(−1), and by inspecting the form of f(x) for negative values of x, determine what you can about the positions of the real roots of f(x) = 0.

(a) We start by ﬁnding the derivative of f(x) and note that, because f contains no linear term, f can be written as the product of x and a ﬁfth-degree polynomial:

f(x) = x7 + 5x6 + x4 − x3 + x2 − 2 = 0,

f (x) = x(7x5 + 30x4 + 4x2 − 3x + 2)

=

x[

]

=

x[

7x5

+

30x4

+

4(x

−

3 8

)2

+

23 16

].

Since, for positive x, every term in this last expression is necessarily positive, it follows that f (x) can have no zeros in the range 0 < x < ∞. Consequently, f(x) can have no turning points in that range and f(x) = 0 can have at most one root in the same range. However, f(+∞) = +∞ and f(0) = −2 < 0 and so f(x) = 0 has at least one root in 0 < x < ∞. Consequently it has exactly one root in the range.

(b) f(1) = 5, f(0) = −2 and f(−1) = 5, and so there is at least one root in each of the ranges 0 < x < 1 and −1 < x < 0.

There is no simple systematic way to examine the form of a general polynomial function for the purpose of determining where its zeros lie, but it is sometimes

2

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA

helpful to group terms in the polynomial and determine how the sign of each group depends upon the range in which x lies. Here grouping successive pairs of terms yields some information as follows:

x7 + 5x6 is positive for x > −5,

x4 − x3 is positive for x > 1 and x < 0,

√

√

x2 − 2 is positive for x > 2 and x < − 2.

Thus, all th√ree terms are positive in the range(s) common to these, namely −5 < x < − 2 and x > 1. It follows that f(x) is positive deﬁnite in these ranges and there can be no roots of f(x) = 0 within them. However, since f(x) is negative for large negative x, there must be at least one root α with α < −5.

1.5 Construct the quadratic equations that have the following pairs of roots: (a) −6, −3; (b) 0, 4; (c) 2, 2; (d) 3 + 2i, 3 − 2i, where i2 = −1.

Starting in each case from the ‘product of factors’ form of the quadratic equation,

(x − α1)(x − α2) = 0, we obtain:

(a)

(x + 6)(x + 3) = x2 + 9x + 18 = 0;

(b)

(x − 0)(x − 4) = x2 − 4x = 0;

(c)

(x − 2)(x − 2) = x2 − 4x + 4 = 0;

(d) (x − 3 − 2i)(x − 3 + 2i) = x2 + x(−3 − 2i − 3 + 2i)

+ (9 − 6i + 6i − 4i2)

= x2 − 6x + 13 = 0.

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA

Recalling that the inverse sine yields two values and that the individual signs of a and b have to be taken into account, we have

√ (b) k = 6, K = 42 + 32 = 5. Since k > K there is no solution for a real angle θ.

√ (c) k = −6, K = 122 + 52 = 13, φ = tan−1(−5/12) and so

1.11 Find all the solutions of sin θ + sin 4θ = sin 2θ + sin 3θ
that lie in the range −π < θ ≤ π. What is the multiplicity of the solution θ = 0?

Using

sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B,

and cos A − cos B = −2 sin A + B sin A − B ,

2

and recalling that cos(−φ) = cos(φ), the equation can be written successively as

2 sin 5θ cos − 3θ = 2 sin 5θ cos − θ ,

sin 5θ cos 3θ − cos θ = 0,

The ﬁrst factor gives solutions for θ of −4π/5, −2π/5, 0, 2π/5 and 4π/5. The second factor gives rise to solutions 0 and π, whilst the only value making the third factor zero is θ = 0. The solution θ = 0 appears in each of the above sets and so has multiplicity 3.

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA

Coordinate geometry

1.13 Determine the forms of the conic sections described by the following equations:
(a) x2 + y2 + 6x + 8y = 0; (b) 9x2 − 4y2 − 54x − 16y + 29 = 0; (c) 2x2 + 2y2 + 5xy − 4x + y − 6 = 0; (d) x2 + y2 + 2xy − 8x + 8y = 0.

(a) x2 + y2 + 6x + 8y = 0. The coeﬃcients of x2 and y2 are equal and there is no xy term; it follows that this must represent a circle. Rewriting the equation in standard circle form by ‘completing the squares’ in the terms that involve x and y, each variable treated separately, we obtain
(x + 3)2 + (y + 4)2 − (32 + 42) = 0. √
The equation is therefore that of a circle of radius 32 + 42 = 5 centred on (−3, −4). (b) 9x2 − 4y2 − 54x − 16y + 29 = 0. This equation contains no xy term and so the centre of the curve will be at ( 54/(2 × 9), 16/[2 × (−4)] ) = (3, −2), and in standardised form the equation is
9(x − 3)2 − 4(y + 2)2 + 29 − 81 + 16 = 0,

or

(x − 3)2 (y + 2)2

−

= 1.

The minus sign between the terms on the LHS implies that this conic section is a

(c) 2x2 + 2y2 + 5xy − 4x + y − 6 = 0. As an xy term is present the equation

cannot represent an ellipse or hyperbola in standard form. Whether it represents

two straight lines can be most easily investigated by taking the lines in the form

aix+biy +1 = 0, (i = 1, 2) and comparing the product (a1x+b1y +1)(a2x+b2y +1)

with

the

equation

[note

that

the

two

alternative pairings do not do so]. That a consistent set can be found shows that

the equation does indeed represent a pair of straight lines, x + 2y − 3 = 0 and

2x + y + 2 = 0.

(d) x2 + y2 + 2xy − 8x + 8y = 0. We note that the ﬁrst three terms can be written

as a perfect square and so the equation can be rewritten as

(x + y)2 = 8(x − y).

The two lines given by x + y = 0 and x − y = 0 are orthogonal and so the equation is of the form u2 = 4av, which, for Cartesian coordinates u, v, represents a parabola passing through the origin, symmetric about the v-axis (u = 0) and deﬁned for v ≥ 0. Thus the original equation is that of a parabola, symmetric about the line x + y = 0, passing through the origin and deﬁned in the region x ≥ y.

(ii) Substituting speciﬁc numerical values for x and solving the resulting simultaneous equations.
(iii) Evaluation of the fraction at each of the roots of its denominator, imagining a factored denominator with the factor corresponding to the root omitted – often known as the ‘cover-up’ method.

Verify that the decomposition obtained is independent of the method used.

(a) For the function

x−6

g(x)

f(x) = x3 − x2 + 4x − 4 = h(x)

the ﬁrst task is to factorise the denominator. By inspection, h(1) = 0 and so x − 1 is a factor of the denominator.

Write

x3 − x2 + 4x − 4 = (x − 1)(x2 + b1x + b0).

Equating coeﬃcients: −1 = b1 − 1, 4 = −b1 + b0 and −4 = −b0, giving b1 = 0

Comparing the coeﬃcients of the various powers of x in this numerator with those in the numerator of the original expression gives A + B = 0, C − B = 1 and 4A − C = −6, which in turn yield A = −1, B = 1 and C = 2. Thus,

(b) By inspection, the denominator of

1.23 Prove that 32n + 7, where n is a non-negative integer, is divisible by 8.
As usual, we assume that the result is valid for n = N and consider the expression with N replaced by N + 1:
32(N+1) + 7 = 32N+2 + 7 + 32N − 32N = (32N + 7) + 32N(9 − 1).
By the assumption, the ﬁrst term on the RHS is divisible by 8; the second is clearly so. Thus 32(N+1) + 7 is divisible by 8. This shows that the result is valid for n = N + 1 if it is valid for n = N. But the assumed result is trivially valid for n = 0 and is therefore valid for all n.

1.27 Establish the values of k for which the binomial coeﬃcient pCk is divisible by
p when p is a prime number. Use your result and the method of induction to prove that np − n is divisible by p for all integers n and all prime numbers p. Deduce that n5 − n is divisible by 30 for any integer n.

Since

pCk

=

p! k!(p −

, k)!

its numerator will always contain a factor p. Therefore, the fraction will be divisible by p unless the denominator happens to contain a (cancelling) factor of p. Since p is prime, this latter factor cannot arise from the product of two or more terms in the denominator; nor can p have any factor that cancels with a

12

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA
term in the denominator. Thus, for cancellation to occur, either k! or (p − k)! must contain a term p; this can only happen for k = p or k = 0; for all other values of k, pCk will be divisible by p.
Assume that np − n is divisible by prime number p for n = N. Clearly this is true for N = 1 and any p. Now, using the binomial expansion of (N + 1)p, consider
p
(N + 1)p − (N + 1) = pCkNk − (N + 1)
k=0 p−1
= 1 + pCkNk + Np − N − 1.
k=1
But, as shown above, pCk is divisible by p for all k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ p − 1, and Np − N is divisible by p, by assumption. Thus (N + 1)p − (N + 1) is divisible by p if it is true that Np − N is divisible by p. Taking N = 1, for which, as noted above, the assumption is valid by inspection for any p, the result follows for all positive integers n and all primes p.
Now consider f(n) = n5 − n. By the result just proved f(n) is divisible by (prime number) 5. Further, f(n) = n(n4 − 1) = n(n2 − 1)(n2 + 1) = n(n − 1)(n + 1)(n2 + 1). Thus the factorisation of f(n) contains three consecutive integers; one of them must be divisible by 3 and at least one must be even and hence divisible by 2. Thus, f(n) has the prime numbers 2, 3 and 5 as its divisors and must therefore be divisible by 30.

1.29 Prove, by the method of contradiction, that the equation xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 = 0,
in which all the coeﬃcients ai are integers, cannot have a rational root, unless that root is an integer. Deduce that any integral root must be a divisor of a0 and hence ﬁnd all rational roots of
(a) x4 + 6x3 + 4x2 + 5x + 4 = 0, (b) x4 + 5x3 + 2x2 − 10x + 6 = 0.

Suppose that the equation has a rational root x = p/q, where integers p and q
have no common factor and q is neither 0 nor 1. Then substituting the root and multiplying the resulting equation by qn−1 gives

pn q

But the ﬁrst term of this equation is not an integer (since p and q have no factor

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA

in common) whilst each of the remaining terms is a product of integers and is therefore an integer. Thus we have an integer equal to (minus) a non-integer. This is a contradiction and shows that it was wrong to suppose that the original equation has a rational non-integer root.

From the general properties of polynomial equations we have that the product of

the roots of the equation

n i=0

bixi

=

0

is

(−1)nb0/bn.

For

our

original

equation,

bn = 1 and b0 = a0. Consequently, the product of its roots is equal to the integral

value (−1)na0. Since there are no non-integral rational roots it follows that any

integral root must be a divisor of a0.

(a) x4 +6x3 +4x2 +5x+4 = 0. This equation has integer coeﬃcients and a leading

coeﬃcient equal to unity. We can thus apply the above result, which shows that

its only possible rational roots are the six integers ±1, ±2 and ±4. Of these, all

positive values are impossible (since then every term would be positive) and trial

and error will show that none of the negative values is a root either.

(b) x4 + 5x3 + 2x2 − 10x + 6 = 0. In the same way as above, we deduce that for this equation the only possible rational roots are the eight values ±1, ±2, ±3 and ±6. Substituting each in turn shows that only x = −3 satisﬁes the equation.

Necessary and suﬃcient conditions
1.31 For the real variable x, show that a suﬃcient, but not necessary, condition for f(x) = x(x + 1)(2x + 1) to be divisible by 6 is that x is an integer.
First suppose that x is an integer and consider f(x) expressed as
f(x) = x(x + 1)(2x + 1) = x(x + 1)(x + 2) + x(x + 1)(x − 1).
Each term on the RHS consists of the product of three consecutive integers. In such a product one of the integers must divide by 3 and at least one of the other integers must be even. Thus each product separately divides by both 3 and 2, and hence by 6, and therefore so does their sum f(x). Thus x being an integer is a suﬃcient condition for f(x) to be divisible by 6. That it is not a necessary condition can be shown by considering an equation of the form
f(x) = x(x + 1)(2x + 1) = 2x3 + 3x2 + x = 6m,
where m is an integer. As a speciﬁc counter-example consider the case m = 4. We note that f(1) = 6 whilst f(2) = 30. Thus there must be a root of the equation that lies strictly between the values 1 and 2, i.e a non-integer value of x that makes f(x) equal to 24 and hence divisible by 6. This establishes the result that x being an integer is not a necessary condition for f(x) to be divisible by 6.

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA
1.33 The coeﬃcients ai in the polynomial Q(x) = a4x4 + a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x are all integers. Show that Q(n) is divisible by 24 for all integers n ≥ 0 if and only if all of the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) 2a4 + a3 is divisible by 4; (ii) a4 + a2 is divisible by 12; (iii) a4 + a3 + a2 + a1 is divisible by 24.
This problem involves both proof by induction and proof of the ‘if and only if’ variety. Firstly, assume that the three conditions are satisﬁed:
2a4 + a3 = 4α, a4 + a2 = 12β, a4 + a3 + a2 + a1 = 24γ, where α, β and γ are integers. We now have to prove that Q(n) = a4n4 + a3n3 + a2n2 + a1n is divisible by 24 for all integers n ≥ 0. It is clearly true for n = 0, and we assume that it is true for n = N and that Q(N) = 24m for some integer m. Now consider Q(N + 1): Q(N + 1) = a4(N + 1)4 + a3(N + 1)3 + a2(N + 1)2 + a1(N + 1) = a4N4 + a3N3 + a2N2 + a1N + 4a4N3 + (6a4 + 3a3)N2 +(4a4 + 3a3 + 2a2)N + (a4 + a3 + a2 + a1) = 24m + 4a4N3 + 3(4α)N2 +[4a4 + (12α − 6a4) + (24β − 2a4)]N + 24γ = 24(m + γ + βN) + 12αN(N + 1) + 4a4(N − 1)N(N + 1).
Now N(N + 1) is the product of two consecutive integers and so one must be even and contain a factor of 2; likewise (N − 1)N(N + 1), being the product of three consecutive integers, must contain both 2 and 3 as factors. Thus every term in the expression for Q(N + 1) divides by 24 and so, therefore, does Q(N + 1). Thus the proposal is true for n = N + 1 if it is true for n = N, and this, together with our observation for n = 0, completes the ‘if’ part of the proof. Now suppose that Q(n) = a4n4 + a3n3 + a2n2 + a1n is divisible by 24 for all integers n ≥ 0. Setting n equal to 1, 2 and 3 in turn, we have
a4 + a3 + a2 + a1 = 24p, 16a4 + 8a3 + 4a2 + 2a1 = 24q, 81a4 + 27a3 + 9a2 + 3a1 = 24r,
for some integers p, q and r. The ﬁrst of these equations is condition (iii). The
15

PRELIMINARY ALGEBRA other conditions are established by combining the above equations as follows:
14a4 + 6a3 + 2a2 = 24(q − 2p), 78a4 + 24a3 + 6a2 = 24(r − 3p),
36a4 + 6a3 = 24(r − 3p − 3q + 6p), 22a4 − 2a2 = 24(r − 3p − 4q + 8p). The two ﬁnal equations show that 6a4 + a3 is divisible by 4 and that 11a4 − a2 is divisible by 12. But, if 6a4 + a3 is divisible by 4 then so is (6 − 4)a4 + a3, i.e. 2a4 + a3. Similarly, 11a4 − a2 being divisible by 12 implies that 12a4 − (11a4 − a2), i.e. a4 + a2, is also divisible by 12. Thus, conditions (i) and (ii) are established and the ‘only if’ part of the proof is complete.

2.13 Show that the lowest value taken by the function 3x4 +4x3 −12x2 +6 is −26.
We need to calculate the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the function in order to establish the positions and natures of its turning points:
y(x) = 3x4 + 4x3 − 12x2 + 6, y (x) = 12x3 + 12x2 − 24x, y (x) = 36x2 + 24x − 24.
Setting y (x) = 0 gives x(x + 2)(x − 1) = 0 with roots 0, 1 and −2. The corresponding values of y (x) are −24, 36 and 72. Since y(±∞) = ∞, the lowest value of y is that corresponding to the lowest minimum, which can only be at x = 1 or x = −2, as y must be positive at a minimum. The values of y(x) at these two points are y(1) = 1 and y(−2) = −26, and so the lowest value taken is −26.

exp(− 2) < a < exp( 2).

Since the logarithm of a variable varies monotonically with the variable, the stationary points of the logarithm of a function of x occur at the same values of x as the stationary points of the function. As x appears as an exponent in the given function, we take logarithms before diﬀerentiating and obtain:
ln y = ln x + 2x ln a + x2, 1 dy 1
= + 2 ln a + 2x. y dx x
For a stationary point dy/dx = 0. Except at x = 0 (where y is also 0), this equation reduces to
2x2 + 2x ln a + 1 = 0.
This qua√dratic equation has no real roots for x if √4(ln a)2 < 4 ×√2 × 1, i.e. | ln a| < 2; a result that can also be written as exp(− 2) < a < exp( 2).

2.17 The parametric equations for the motion of a charged particle released from rest in electric and magnetic ﬁelds at right angles to each other take the forms

= (0)(e2x) + 4(12)(2e2x) + 6(12x + 6)(4e2x) + 4(6x2 + 6x + 1)(8e2x) + (2x3 + 3x2 + x + 2)(16e2x)
= 16(2x3 + 15x2 + 31x + 19)e2x.

2.23 Use the properties of functions at their turning points to do the following.
(a) By considering its properties near x = 1, show that f(x) = 5x4 − 11x3 + 26x2 − 44x + 24 takes negative values for some range of x.
(b) Show that f(x) = tan x − x cannot be negative for 0 ≤ x < π/2, and deduce that g(x) = x−1 sin x decreases monotonically in the same range.

(a) We begin by evaluating f(1) and ﬁnd that f(1) = 5 − 11 + 26 − 44 + 24 = 0. This suggests that f(x) will be positive on one side of x = 1 and negative on the other. However, to be sure of this we need to establish that x = 1 is not a turning point of f(x). To do this we calculate its derivative there:

f(x) = 5x4 − 11x3 + 26x2 − 44x + 24, f (x) = 20x3 − 33x2 + 52x − 44, f (1) = 20 − 33 + 52 − 44 = −5 = 0.

So, f (1) is negative and f is decreasing at this point, where its value is 0. Therefore f(x) must be negative in the range 1 < x < α for some α > 1.

(b) The function f(x) = tan x − x is diﬀerentiable in the range 0 ≤ x < π/2, and f (x) = sec2 x − 1 = tan2 x which is > 0 for all x in the range; taken together
with f(0) = 0, this establishes the result.

For g(x) = (sin x)/x, the rule for diﬀerentiating quotients gives

x cos x − sin x cos x(tan x − x)

g (x) =

x2

=−

x2

.

The term in parenthesis cannot be negative in the range 0 ≤ x < π/2, and in the same range cos x > 0. Thus g (x) is never positive in the range and g(x) decreases monotonically [ from its value of g(0) = 1 ].

26

PRELIMINARY CALCULUS
2.25 By applying Rolle’s theorem to xn sin nx, where n is an arbitrary positive integer, show that tan nx + x = 0 has a solution α1 with 0 < α1 < π/n. Apply the theorem a second time to obtain the nonsensical result that there is a real α2 in 0 < α2 < π/n, such that cos2(nα2) = −n. Explain why this incorrect result arises.
Clearly, the function f(x) = xn sin nx has zeroes at x = 0 and x = π/n. Therefore, by Rolle’s theorem, its derivative,
f (x) = nxn−1 sin nx + nxn cos nx,
must have a zero in the range 0 < x < π/n. But, since x = 0 and n = 0, this is equivalent to a root α1 of tan nx + x = 0 in the same range. To obtain this result we have divided f (x) = 0 through by cos nx; this is allowed, since x = π/(2n), the value that makes cos nx = 0, is not a solution of f (x) = 0. We now note that g(x) = tan nx + x has zeroes at x = 0 and x = α1. Applying Rolle’s theorem again (blindly) then shows that g (x) = n sec2 nx + 1 has a zero α2 in the range 0 < α2 < α1 < π/n, with cos2(nα2) = −n. The false result arises because tan nx is not diﬀerentiable at x = π/(2n), which lies in the range 0 < x < π/n, and so the conditions for applying Rolle’s theorem are not satisﬁed.
2.27 For the function y(x) = x2 exp(−x) obtain a simple relationship between y and dy/dx and then, by applying Leibnitz’ theorem, prove that
xy(n+1) + (n + x − 2)y(n) + ny(n−1) = 0.
The required function and its ﬁrst derivative are y(x) = x2e−x, y (x) = 2xe−x − x2e−x = 2xe−x − y.
Multiplying through by a factor x will enable us to express the ﬁrst term on the RHS in terms of y and obtain
xy = 2y − xy.
Now we apply Leibnitz’ theorem to obtain the nth derivatives of both sides of this last equation, noting that the only non-zero derivative of x is the ﬁrst derivative. We obtain
xy(n+1) + n(1)y(n) = 2y(n) − [ xy(n) + n(1)y(n−1) ],
27

PRELIMINARY CALCULUS
which can be rearranged as xy(n+1) + (n + x − 2)y(n) + ny(n−1) = 0,
thus completing the proof.

2.29 Show that the curve x3 + y3 − 12x − 8y − 16 = 0 touches the x-axis.

We ﬁrst ﬁnd an expression for the slope of the curve as a function of x and y. From
x3 + y3 − 12x − 8y − 16 = 0

we obtain, by implicit diﬀerentiation, that

3x2 + 3y2y − 12 − 8y = 0

⇒

3x2 − 12 y = 8 − 3y2 .

Clearly y = 0 at x = ±2. At x = 2,

8 + y3 − 24 − 8y − 16 = 0 ⇒ y = 0.

However, at x = −2, −8 + y3 + 24 − 8y − 16 = 0,

with one solution y = 0.

Thus the point (−2, 0) lies on the curve and y = 0 there. It follows that the curve touches the x-axis at that point.

In each case, we ﬁrst ‘complete the square’ in the denominator, i.e. write it in such a form that x appears only in a term that is the square of a linear function of x. We then examine the overall sign of the terms that do not contain x; this determines the form of the integral. In case (iii) there is no such term.

There are usually several possible choices but the one that makes both u and v as simple as possible is normally the best.

(a) Here the obvious choice at the ﬁrst stage is u(x) = x2 and v (x) = sin x. For the second stage, u = x and v = cos x are equally clear assignments.

3.7 Show that the locus of all points z = x + iy in the complex plane that satisfy
|z − ia| = λ|z + ia|, λ > 0, is a circle of radius |2aλ/(1 − λ2)| centred on the point z = ia[(1 + λ2)/(1 − λ2)]. Sketch the circles for a few typical values of λ, including λ < 1, λ > 1 and λ = 1.

As we wish to ﬁnd the locus in the x-y plane, we ﬁrst express |z ± ia| explicitly in terms of x and y, remembering that a can be complex:
| x + iy − ia|2 = (x + iy − ia)(x − iy + ia∗) = x2 + y2 + | a |2 − ia(x − iy) + ia∗(x + iy).
| x + iy + ia|2 = (x + iy + ia)(x − iy − ia∗) = x2 + y2 + | a |2 + ia(x − iy) − ia∗(x + iy).

(a) Re ln z + ia

(b) Im ln z + ia

c > 0, 0 ≤ k ≤ π/2.

Identify the two families of curves and verify that in case (b) all curves pass through the two points ±ia.

ln z = ln |z| + i arg z

we have

Re ln z − ia = ln z − ia = c, c > 0,

z + ia

|z − ia| = ec|z + ia|, ec > 1.

As in exercise 3.7, this is a circle of radius |2aec/(1 − e2c)| = |a| cosech c centred on the point z = ia(1 + e2c)/(1 − e2c) = ia coth c. As c varies this generates a family of circles whose centres lie on the y-axis above the point z = ia (or below the point z = ia if a is negative) and whose radii decrease as their centres approach that point. The curve corresponding to c = 0 is the x-axis.

2ax = a2 tan k − (x2 + y2) tan k,

(x + a cot k)2 + y2 = a2(1 + cot2 k).

This is a circle with centre (−a cot k, 0) and radius a cosec k. As k varies the curves generate a family of circles whose centres lie on the negative x-axis (for a > 0) and whose radii decrease to a as their centres approach the origin. The curve corresponding to k = 0 is the y-axis.

44

COMPLEX NUMBERS AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
The two points z = ±ia = (0, ±a) lie on the curve if (0 + a cot k)2 + a2 = a2(1 + cot2 k).
This is identically satisﬁed, verifying that all members of the family pass through the two points z = ±ia.

3.11 Sketch the parts of the Argand diagram in which
(a) Re z2 < 0, |z1/2| ≤ 2; (b) 0 ≤ arg z∗ ≤ π/2; (c) | exp z3| → 0 as |z| → ∞.
What is the area of the region in which all three sets of conditions are satisﬁed?

Since we will need to study the signs of the real parts of certain powers of z, it will be convenient to consider z as r eiθ with 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π.

Condition (a) contains two speciﬁcations. Firstly, for the real part of z2 to be negative, its argument must be greater than π/2 but less than 3π/2. The argument of z itself, which is half that of z2 (mod 2π), must therefore lie in one of the two ranges π/4 < arg z < 3π/4 and 5π/4 < arg z < 7π/4. Secondly, since the modulus of any complex number is real and positive, |z1/2| ≤ 2 is equivalent to |z| ≤ 4.

Since arg z∗ = − arg z, condition (b) requires arg z to lie in the range 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, i.e z to lie in the fourth quadrant.

Condition (c) will only be satisﬁed if the real part of z3 is negative. This requires

π

(4n + 1) < 3θ < (4n + 3) ,

n = 0, 1, 2.

The allowed regions for θ are thus alternate wedges of angular size π/3 with an allowed region starting at θ = π/6. The allowed region overlapping those speciﬁed by conditions (a) and (b) is the wedge 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 11π/6.

All three conditions are satisﬁed in the region 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 7π/4, |z| ≤ 4; see ﬁgure 3.3. This wedge has an area given by

For the sake of brevity, we shall denote x2m+1 − a2m+1 by f(x) and the (2m + 1)th root of unity, exp[ 2πi/(2m + 1) ], by Ω.
Now consider the roots of the equation f(x) = 0. The 2m + 1 quantities of the form x = aΩr with r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2m are all solutions of this equation and, since it is a polynomial equation of order 2m + 1, they represent all of its roots. We can therefore reconstruct the polynomial f(x) (which has unity as the coeﬃcient of its highest power) as the product of factors of the form (x − aΩr):
f(x) = (x − a)(x − aΩ) · · · (x − aΩm)(x − aΩm+1) · · · (x − aΩ2m).

3.15 Solve the equation z7 − 4z6 + 6z5 − 6z4 + 6z3 − 12z2 + 8z + 4 = 0,
(a) by examining the eﬀect of setting z3 equal to 2, and then (b) by factorising and using the binomial expansion of (z + a)4.
Plot the seven roots of the equation on an Argand plot, exemplifying that complex roots of a polynomial equation always occur in conjugate pairs if the polynomial has real coeﬃcients.
(a) Setting z3 = 2 in f(z) so as to leave no higher powers of z than its square, e.g. writing z7 as (z3)2z = 4z, gives
4z − 16 + 12z2 − 12z + 12 − 12z2 + 8z + 4 = 0, which is satisﬁed identically. Thus z3 − 2 is a factor of f(z). (b) Writing f(z) as
f(z) = (z3 − 2)(az4 + bz3 + cz2 + dz + e) = 0 and equating the coeﬃcients of the various powers of z gives a = 1, b = −4, c = 6, d − 2a = −6, e − 2b = 6, −2c = −12, −2d = 8 and −2e = 4. These imply (consistently) that f(z) can be written as
f(z) = (z3 − 2)(z4 − 4z3 + 6z2 − 4z − 2). We now note that the ﬁrst four terms in the second set of parentheses are the
47

COMPLEX NUMBERS AND HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
same as the corresponding terms in the expansion of (z − 1)4; only the constant term needs correction. Thus, we may write the original equation as
0 = f(z) = (z3 − 2)[(z − 1)4 − 3], with solutions z = 21/3e2nπi/3 n = 0, 1, 2 or
z − 1 = 31/4e2nπi/4 n = 0, 1, 2, 3. The seven roots are therefore
√ 21/3, 21/3 −1 ± i 3 , 1 ± 31/4, 1 ± 31/4i.
2 As is to be expected, each root that has a non-zero imaginary part occurs as one of a complex conjugate pair.
3.17 The binomial expansion of (1 + x)n can be written for a positive integer n as
n
(1 + x)n = nCrxr,
r=0
where nCr = n!/[r!(n − r)!].
(a) Use de Moivre’s theorem to show that the sum S1(n) = nC0 − nC2 + nC4 − · · · + (−1)m nC2m, n − 1 ≤ 2m ≤ n,
has the value 2n/2 cos(nπ/4). (b) Derive a similar result for the sum
S2(n) = nC1 − nC3 + nC5 − · · · + (−1)m nC2m+1, n − 1 ≤ 2m + 1 ≤ n, and verify it for the cases n = 6, 7 and 8.

Since we seek the sum of binomial coeﬃcients that contain either all even or

all odd indices, we need to choose a value for x such that xr has diﬀerent

characteristics depending upon whether r is even or odd. The quantity i has just

such a property, being purely real when r is even√and purely imaginary when r is odd. We therefore take x = i, write 1 + i as 2eiπ/4 and apply de Moivre’s

theorem:

2eiπ/4 = (1 + i)n

(b) The corresponding result for S2(n) is that it is equal to the imaginary part of 2n/2einπ/4, which is 2n/2 sin(nπ/4).

We now verify this result for n = 6, 7 and 8 by direct calculation:

From de Moivre’s theorem, ei4θ = cos 4θ + i sin 4θ. But, by the binomial theorem, we also have that

ei4θ = (cos θ + i sin θ)4 = cos4 θ + 4i cos3 θ sin θ − 6 cos2 θ sin2 θ − 4i cos θ sin3 θ + sin4 θ.
Equating the real parts of the two equal expressions and writing sin2 θ as 1−cos2 θ,

cos 4θ = cos4 θ − 6 cos2 θ(1 − cos2 θ) + (1 − cos2 θ)2 = 8 cos4 θ − 8 cos2 θ + 1.

Now set θ = π/8 in this result and write cos(π/8) as c:

0 = cos 4π = 8c4 − 8c2 + 1. 8

Hence, as this is a quadratic equation in c2,

Sin√ce 0 < π/8 < π/2, c must be √positive. Further, as π/8 < π/4 and cos(π/4) = 1/ 2, c must be greater then 1/ 2. It is clear that the positive square roots are the appropriate ones in both cases.

where t = tan θ. Deduce the values of tan(nπ/10) for n = 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Using the binomial theorem and de Moivre’s theorem to expand (eiθ)5 in two diﬀerent ways, we have, from equating the real and imaginary parts of the two results, that

cos 5θ + i sin 5θ = cos5 θ + i5 cos4 θ sin θ − 10 cos3 θ sin2 θ −i10 cos2 θ sin3 θ + 5 cos θ sin4 θ + i sin5 θ,
cos 5θ = cos5 θ − 10 cos3 θ(1 − cos2 θ) +5 cos θ(1 − 2 cos2 θ + cos4 θ)
= 16 cos5 θ − 20 cos3 θ + 5 cos θ, sin 5θ = 5(1 − 2 sin2 θ + sin4 θ) sin θ
−10(1 − sin2 θ) sin3 θ + sin5 θ = 16 sin5 θ − 20 sin3 θ + 5 sin θ.

Now, writing cos θ as c, sin θ as s and tan θ as t, and further recalling that c−2 = 1 + t2, we have
16s5 − 20s3 + 5s tan 5θ = 16c5 − 20c3 + 5c

16t5 − 20t3c−2 + 5tc−4 = 16 − 20c−2 + 5c−4

3.23 Determine the conditions under which the equation

and

sinh x

and

then

rewrite the equation as a quadratic equation in ex:

a cosh x + b sinh x − c = 0, (a + b)ex − 2c + (a − b)e−x = 0, (a + b)e2x − 2cex + (a − b) = 0.

Hence,

ex = c ±

c2 − (a2 − b2) .

a+b

For x to be real, ex must be real and ≥ 0. Since c > 0, this implies that a + b > 0 and c2 + b2 ≥ a2. Provided these two conditions are satisﬁed, there are two roots if c2 + b2 − a2 < c2, i.e. if b2 < a2, but only one root if c2 + b2 − a2 > c2, i.e. if b2 > a2.

3.25 Express sinh4 x in terms of hyperbolic cosines of multiples of x, and hence ﬁnd the real solutions of
2 cosh 4x − 8 cosh 2x + 5 = 0.

In order to connect sinh4 x to hyperbolic functions of other multiples of x, we need to express it in terms of powers of e±x and then to group the terms so as to
make up those hyperbolic functions. Starting from

we have from the binomial theorem that

sinh4 x

e4x − 4e2x + 6 − 4e−2x + e−4x

Terms containing related exponents nx and −nx can now be grouped together and expressed as a linear sum of cosh nx and sinh nx; here, because of the symmetry properties of the binomial coeﬃcients, only the cosh nx combinations appear and yield

Now consider the relationship between this expression and the LHS of the given equation. They are clearly closely related; one is a multiple of the other, except in respect of the constant term. Making compensating corrections to the constant term allows us to rewrite the equation in terms of sinh4 x as follows:

2 cosh 4x − 8 cosh 2x + (6 − 1) = 0,

where Mk is the lowest integer such that ln Mk > k. The notation is such that when ek−1 < n < ek then n = Mk−1 + rk.

For each ﬁxed k, every term in the second (ﬁnite) summation is smaller than the
corresponding term in S (because n < Mk). But, since all the terms in such a summation are equal, the value of the sum is simply (Mk − Mk−1)/(ln Mk)X. Thus,

Thus, the series is absolutely convergent for all ﬁnite x.

The nth logarithmic term is positive for all n but, as shown above, less than n−2. It follows from the comparison test that the series is (absolutely) convergent.

For the odd series we consider

4m2 + 4m

ln (2m + 1)2 = ln 4m2 + 4m + 1

= − ln

1 1+
4m(m + 1)

.

By a similar argument to that above, each term is negative but greater than −[ 4m(m + 1) ]−1. Again, the comparison test shows that the series is (absolutely) convergent.

Thus the original series, being the sum of two absolutely convergent series, is also absolutely convergent.

(ii) For r = 1 we have to consider ln[(n ± 1)/n], whose expansion contains a term ±n−1 and other inverse powers of n. The summations over the other powers converge and cannot cancel the divergence arising from ±n−1. Thus both the even and odd series diverge; consequently the original series cannot be absolutely
convergent.

4.31 Using a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion about x = x0, show that a better approximation than x0 to the solution of the equation

(a) Use this procedure twice to ﬁnd the solution of f(x) = 2 to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures, given that it is close to x = 0.9.
(b) Use the result in (a) to deduce, to the same degree of accuracy, one solution of the quartic equation
y4 − 4y3 + 4y2 + 4y − 4 = 0.

(a) We write the solution to f(x) = sin x + tan x = 2 as x = x0 + δ. Substituting this form and retaining the ﬁrst-order terms in δ in the Taylor expansions of sin x and tan x we obtain
sin x0 + δ cos x0 + · · · + tan x0 + δ sec2 x0 + · · · = 2

3.209609

making the ﬁrst improved approximation x1 = x0 + δ1 = 0.886452.

Now, using x1 instead of x0 and repeating the process gives

δ2

making the second improved approximation x2 = x1 +δ2 = 0.886287. The method used up to here does not prove that this latest answer is accurate to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures, but a further application of the procedure shows that δ3 ≈ 3 × 10−7.

(b) In order to make use of the result in part (a) we need to make a change of variable that converts the geometric equation into an algebraic one. Since tan x can be expressed in terms of sin x, if we set y = sin x in the equation

67

SERIES AND LIMITS

sin x + tan x = 2, it will become an algebraic equation:

sin x

sin x + tan x = sin x + cos x = 2,

(2 − y)2,

y2 = (1 − y2)(4 − 4y + y2)

= −y4 + 4y3 − 3y2 − 4y + 4,

0 = y4 − 4y3 + 4y2 + 4y − 4.

This is the equation that is to be solved. Thus, since x = 0.886287 is an approximation to the solution of sin x + tan x = 2, y = sin x = 0.774730 is an approximation to one of the solutions of y4 − 4y3 + 4y2 + 4y − 4 = 0 to the same degree of accuracy.
We note that an equally plausible change of variable is to set y = tan x, with sin x expressed as tan x/ sec x, i.e. as y/ 1 + y2. With this substitution the resulting algebraic equation is the quartic y4 − 4y3 + 4y2 − 4y + 4 = 0 (very similar to, but not exactly the same as, the given quartic equation). The reader may wish to verify this. By a parallel argument to that above, y = tan 0.886287 = 1.225270 is an approximate solution of this second quartic equation.

4.35 One of the factors contributing to the high relative permittivity of water

to static electric ﬁelds is the permanent electric dipole moment, p, of the water

molecule. In an external ﬁeld E the dipoles tend to line up with the ﬁeld, but

they do not do so completely because of thermal agitation corresponding to the

temperature, T , of the water. A classical (non-quantum) calculation using the

Boltzmann distribution shows that the average polarisability per molecule, α, is

given by

α = p (coth x − x−1), E

where x = pE/(kT ) and k is the Boltzmann constant.

At ordinary temperatures, even with high ﬁeld strengths (104 V m−1 or more),
x 1. By making suitable series expansions of the hyperbolic functions involved, show that α = p2/(3kT ) to an accuracy of about one part in 15x−2.

not take into account the values of F(x, y) at points close to, but not on, the line.

The required derivatives are given by ∂f = 3x2y + y3 − y, ∂x

∂2f = 3x2 + 3y2 − 1, ∂x∂y

Any stationary points must satisfy both of the equations

∂f = y(3x2 + y2 − 1) = 0, ∂x ∂f = x(x2 + 3y2 − 1) = 0. ∂y

If x = 0 then y = 0 or ±1. If y = 0 then x = 0 or ±1. Otherwise, adding and subtracting the factors in parentheses gives

Since a = 0, possible solutions for (x, y) are (0, 0), (0, ±a) and (±a, 0). The corresponding values are f(0, 0) = 0, f(0, ±a) = −2a2e−1 and f(±a, 0) = a2e−1. These results, taken together with the observation that |f(x, y)| → 0 as either or both of |x| and |y| → ∞, show that f(x, y) has maxima at (±a, 0), minima at (0, ±a) and a saddle point at the origin.

Sketches of f(x, 0) and f(0, y), whilst hardly necessary, illustrate rather than conﬁrm these conclusions.

Any stationary points must satisfy both of the equations
∂f = 4x(2 + x2 − 3y2) = 0, ∂x ∂f = 4y(2 − 3x2 + y2) = 0. ∂y
If x = 0 then 4y(2 + y2) = 0, implying that y = 0 also, since 2 + y2 = 0 has no real solutions. Conversely, y = 0 implies x = 0. Further solutions exist if both expressions in parentheses equal zero; this requires x2 = y2 = 1.
Thus the stationary points are (0, 0), (1, 1), (−1, 1), (1, −1) and (−1, −1), with corresponding values 0, 4, 4, 4 and 4.
At (0, 0), ∂2f/∂2x = ∂2f/∂2y = 8, whilst ∂2f/∂x∂y = 0. Since 02 < 8 × 8, this point is a minimum.
In the other four cases, ∂2f/∂2x = ∂2f/∂2y = 8, whilst ∂2f/∂x∂y = ±24. Since (24)2 > 8 × 8, these four points are all saddle points.
It will probably be helpful when sketching the contours (ﬁgure 5.1) to determine the behaviour of f(x, y) along the line x = y and to note the symmet√ry a√bout it. In particular, note that f(x, y) = 0 at both the origin and the point ( 2, 2).

5.17 A rectangular parallelepiped has all eight vertices on the ellipsoid
x2 + 3y2 + 3z2 = 1.
Using the symmetry of the parallelepiped about each of the planes x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, write down the surface area of the parallelepiped in terms of the coordinates of the vertex that lies in the octant x, y, z ≥ 0. Hence ﬁnd the maximum value of the surface area of such a parallelepiped.

Let S be the surface area and (x, y, z) the coordinates of one of the corners of the parallelepiped with x, y and z all positive. Then we need to maximise S = 8(xy + yz + zx) subject to x, y and z satisfying x2 + 3y2 + 3z2 = 1.
Consider
f(x, y, z) = 8(xy + yz + zx) + λ(x2 + 3y2 + 3z2),

where λ is a Lagrange undetermined multipier. Then, setting each of the ﬁrst partial derivatives separately to zero, we have the simultaneous equations
0 = ∂f = 8y + 8z + 2λx, ∂x ∂f
0 = = 8x + 8z + 6λy, ∂y ∂f
0 = = 8x + 8y + 6λz. ∂z
From symmetry, y = z, leading to

0 = 16y + 2λx, 0 = 8x + 8y + 6λy.

Thus, rejecting the trivial solution x = 0, y = 0, we conclude that λ = −8y/x, leading to x2 +xy −6y2 = (x−2y)(x+3y) = 0. The only solution to this quadratic equation with x, y and z all positive is x = 2y = 2z. Substituting this into the equation of the ellipse gives

(2y)2 + 3y2 + 3y2 = 1

⇒

y = √1 .

5.19 A barn is to be constructed with a uniform cross-sectional area A throughout its length. The cross-section is to be a rectangle of wall height h (ﬁxed) and width w, surmounted by an isosceles triangular roof that makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The cost of construction is α per unit height of wall and β per unit (slope) length of roof. Show that, irrespective of the values of α and β, to minimise costs w should be chosen to satisfy the equation
w4 = 16A(A − wh),
and θ made such that 2 tan 2θ = w/h.

The cost always includes 2αh for the vertical walls, which can therefore be ignored in the minimisation procedure. The rest of the calculation will be solely concerned with minimising the roof area, and the optimum choices for w and θ will be independent of β, the actual cost per unit length of the roof.
