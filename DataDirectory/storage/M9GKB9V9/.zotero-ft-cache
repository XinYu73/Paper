Separability Criterion for Density Matrices
Asher Peres∗ Department of Physics, Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, 32 000 Haifa, Israel
Abstract A quantum system consisting of two subsystems is separable if its density matrix can
be written as ρ = A wA ρ′A ⊗ ρ′A′ , where ρ′A and ρ′A′ are density matrices for the two subsytems. In this Letter, it is shown that a necessary condition for separability is that a matrix, obtained by partial transposition of ρ, has only non-negative eigenvalues. This criterion is stronger than Bell’s inequality.

A striking quantum phenomenon is the inseparability of composite quantum systems. Its most famous example is the violation of Bell’s inequality, which may be detected if two distant observers, who independently measure subsytems of a composite quantum system, report their results to a common site where that information is analyzed [1]. However, even if Bell’s inequality is satisﬁed by a given composite quantum system, there is no guarantee that its state can be prepared by two distant observers who receive instructions from a common source. For this to be possible, the density matrix ρ has to be separable into a sum of direct products,

ρ = wA ρ′A ⊗ ρ′A′ ,

(1)

A

where the positive weights wA satisfy wA = 1, and where ρ′A and ρ′A′ are density matrices for the two subsystems. A separable system always satisﬁes Bell’s inequality, but the converse is not necessarily true [2–5]. In this Letter, I shall derive a simple algebraic test,

which is a necessary condition for the existence of the decomposition (1). This criterion

is more restrictive than Bell’s inequality, or than the α-entropy inequality [6].

The derivation of this separability condition is best done by writing the density matrix elements explicitly, with all their indices [1]. For example, Eq. (1) becomes

ρmµ,nν = wA (ρ′A)mn (ρ′A′ )µν .

(2)

A

Latin indices refer to the ﬁrst subsystem, Greek indices to the second one (the subsystems may have diﬀerent dimensions). Note that this equation can always be satisﬁed if we replace the quantum density matrices by classical Liouville functions (and the discrete indices are replaced by canonical variables, p and q). The reason is that the only constraint that a Liouville function has to satisfy is being non-negative. On the other hand, we want quantum density matrices to have non-negative eigenvalues, rather than non-negative elements, and the latter condition is more diﬃcult to satisfy.
Let us now deﬁne a new matrix,

σmµ,nν ≡ ρnµ,mν .

(3)

The Latin indices of ρ have been transposed, but not the Greek ones. This is not a unitary transformation but, nevertheless, the σ matrix is Hermitian. Moreover, its eigenvalues are

2

invariant under separate unitary transformations of the bases used by the two observers. Indeed if

ρ → (U ′ ⊗ U ′′) ρ (U ′ ⊗ U ′′)†,

(4)

we have

σ → (U ′T ⊗ U ′′) σ (U ′T ⊗ U ′′)†,

(5)

which also is a unitary transformation, leaving the eigenvalues of σ invariant. When Eq. (1) is valid, we have

σ = wA (ρ′A)T ⊗ ρ′A′ .

(6)

A

Since the transposed matrices (ρ′A)T ≡ (ρ′A)∗ are non-negative matrices with unit trace, they can also be legitimate density matrices. It follows that none of the eigenvalues of σ

is negative. This is a necessary condition for Eq. (1) to hold.

state

(an

impure

singlet),

consisting of a singlet fraction x and a random fraction (1−x) [7]. Note that the “random

fraction” (1 − x) also includes singlets, mixed in equal proportions with the three triplet

components. We have

ρmµ,nν = x Smµ,nν + (1 − x) δmn δµν /4,

(7)

where the density matrix for a pure singlet is given by

S01,01

=

S10,10

=

−S01,10

=

−S10,01

=

,

(8)

and all the other components of S vanish. (The indices 0 and 1 refer to any two ortho-

gonal states, such as “up” and “down.”) A straightforward calculation shows that σ has

three eigenvalues equal to (1 + x)/4, and the fourth eigenvalue is (1 − 3x)/4. This lowest

eigenvalue

is

positive

if

x<

1 3

,

and the

separability

criterion

is

then

fulﬁlled. √

This

result

may be compared with other criteria: Bell’s inequality holds for x < 1/ 2, and the α-

√

entropic inequality [6] for x < 1/ 3. These are therefore much weaker tests for detecting

inseparability than the condition that was derived here.

In this particular case, it happens that this necessary condition is also a suﬃcient one.

that

it

to

product states [8]. This result suggests that the necessary condition derived above (σ has no negative eigenvalue) might also be suﬃcient for any ρ. Some time after this Letter was submitted for publication, a proof of this conjecture was indeed obtained [9] for composite systems having dimensions 2 × 2 and 2 × 3. However, for higher dimensions, the present necessary condition was shown not to be a suﬃcient one.
As a second example, consider a mixed state introduced by Gisin [5]. With the present notations, it consists of a fraction x of the pure state a|01 + b|10 (with |a|2 + |b|2 = 1), and fractions (1 − x)/2 of the pure states |00 and |11 . The non-vanishing elements of ρ thus are

ρ00,00 = ρ11,11 = (1 − x)/2,

(9)

ρ01,01 = x|a|2,

(10)

ρ10,10 = x|b|2,

(11)

ρ01,10 = ρ∗10,01 = xab∗.

(12)

It is easily seen that the σ matrix has a negative determinant, and therefore a negative eigenvalue, when

x > (1 + 2|ab|)−1.

(13)

This is a lower limit than the one for violation of Bell’s inequality, which requires [5]

√

x > [1 + 2|ab|( 2 − 1)]−1.

(14)

An even more striking example is the mixture of a singlet and a maximally polarized pair:

ρmµ,nν = x Smµ,nν + (1 − x) δm0 δn0 δµ0 δν0.

(15)

For any positive x, however small, this state is inseparable, because σ has a negative eigenvalue. On the other hand, the Horodecki criterion [10] gives a very generous domain to the validity of Bell’s inequality: x ≤ 0.8.
The weakness of Bell’s inequality is attributable to the fact that the only use made of the density matrix ρ is for computing the probabilities of the various outcomes of
4

tests that may be performed on the subsystems of a single composite system. On the other hand, an experimental veriﬁcation of that inequality necessitates the use of many composite systems, all prepared in the same way. However, if many such systems are actually available, we may also test them collectively, for example two by two, or three by three, etc., rather than one by one. If we do that, we must use, instead of ρ (the density matrix of a single system), a new density matrix, which is ρ ⊗ ρ, or ρ ⊗ ρ ⊗ ρ, in a higher dimensional space. It then turns out that there are some density matrices ρ that satisfy Bell’s inequality, but for which ρ ⊗ ρ, or ρ ⊗ ρ ⊗ ρ, etc., violate that inequality [11].
This result raises a new question: can we get stronger inseparability criteria by considering ρ ⊗ ρ, or higher tensor products? It is easily seen that no further progress can be achieved in this way. If ρ is separable as in Eq. (1), so is ρ ⊗ ρ. Moreover, the partly transposed matrix corresponding to ρ ⊗ ρ simply is σ ⊗ σ, so that if no eigenvalue of σ is negative, then σ ⊗ σ too has no negative eigenvalue.
I am grateful to R. Horodecki and R. Jozsa for pointing out that Eq. (6) could be used instead of a longer derivation that appeared in an earlier version of this Letter. This work was supported by the Gerard Swope Fund and the Fund for Encouragement of Research.
