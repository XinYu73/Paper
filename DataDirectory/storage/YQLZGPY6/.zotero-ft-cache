Context & Scale

The recent boom in electrical energy storage and conversion with high-energy density facilitates the exploration of Li-metal batteries. However, Li dissolution and nucleation are easily susceptible to thermodynamic conditions that induce dendrite growth, causing tremendous safety hazards, low energy density, and short lifespan. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the thermodynamic effects on lithium deposition and growth is still absent.

The development and latest research progress of thermodynamic-inducing factors regarding lithium nucleation and growth are systematically summarized from theory to experiment, especially focusing on thermodynamic energy, temperature, and related models. Strategies for designing a dendrite-free Li-metal anode through thermodynamic considerations, including structured anode, self-healing dendrite tactics, and electrode and electrolyte interface engineering are also discussed. We highlight the imperfections of present thermodynamic research and propose corresponding feasible solutions. Future work should evaluate each individual system on its own to integrate suitable models that combine with kinetics and other factors to find interrelated strategies to address the dendrite-growth issues under various conditions.
Summary

Li-metal batteries have been emerging as attractive technologies for electrical energy storage and conversion by virtue of the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity of lithium. However, the undesirable Li-dendrite growth upon prolonged cycling gives rise to thermal runaway, inducing tremendous safety concerns that impede the development of the technology. In general, Li nucleation and growth behavior significantly changes when the operating condition is modified through modulating temperature or thermodynamic energy to produce regulated lithium depositions. Herein, this perspective takes these two key factors as an example to emphasize the importance of thermodynamic understandings of the Li-dendrite issue. The key challenges and corresponding strategies for designing advanced dendrite-free Li-metal anodes with respect to thermodynamic factors are also discussed as fundamental guidance for future development.
