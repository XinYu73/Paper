͑Received 26 May 1999; revised manuscript received 10 August 1999͒
We report linear-response kinetic-energy density functionals, which show signiﬁcant improvement over the Wang-Teter, Perrot, Smargiassi-Madden, Wang-Govind-Carter functionals, yet still maintain O(N ln N) scaling. Numerical tests show that these functionals, which contain a double-density-dependent kernel, can reproduce the Kohn-Sham results almost exactly for several aluminum bulk phases. We further show that with a sensible choice of the uniform background density, energies of formation for the low-index aluminum surfaces, where the density variations are very large, can be reproduced to within reasonable accuracy. ͓S0163-1829͑99͒01848-2͔

I. BACKGROUND
Among all linear-scaling O(N) density-functional methods,1–7 the orbital-free Hohenberg-Kohn scheme2–8 is potentially the most attractive. Without any orbital dependence, the complication and cost associated with orbital manipulation, including orbital localization and orbital orthonormalization, are avoided. For metals, the orbital-free scheme is even more rewarding, because the need for Brillouin-zone ͑k-point͒ sampling9 is completely eliminated. However, all these positive features come at a price: accurate, transferable orbital-free kinetic-energy density functionals do not, as yet, exist in our O(N) arsenal. We set our task toward surmounting this problem in this paper.
The Wang-Teter ͑WT͒, Perrot, Smargiassi-Madden ͑SM͒, Wang-Govind-Carter ͑WGC͒ kinetic-energy density functionals ͑KEDF’s͒ can be conveniently written as3–7

It is well known that TTF͓␳͔ is only exact at the free-electron gas limit and TvW͓␳͔ is only exact for those systems that can be described by a single spatial orbital, i.e., the one- and two-electron ground-state systems.13 Any realistic system
that falls between these two extremes will have to be bridged
somehow by a third term, which can also smoothly recover
the two extreme cases if appropriate conditions are met. Eq. ͑4͒ is then a natural choice for this functional because it possesses the same form as Eqs. ͑5͒ and ͑6͒. Second, there is no reason to go beyond the double-integration form because
the highest rank of the operators in the quantum mechanical
Hamiltonian for isolated Coulomb systems is two. This sim-
ply means that for any second-rank operator of the form

The speciﬁc form of Eq. ͑4͒ is chosen based on the fol-

lowing analysis. First, one can rewrite TTF͓␳͔ and TvW͓␳͔ in double-integration form12

deeper understanding about the mathematical structure of the

tend in this paper to coherently take all three points into

Unlike the original KEDF’s in Eq. ͑1͒, it is now possible

for a single set of ͕␣,␤͖ to simultaneously remove all spu-

rious ␦␴ terms from Eq. ͑18͒, and reduce it to the correct

Since

approximates ␹Lind well for most ␩ values larger than 1, while the second-order conventional gradient expansion17

͑CGE͒ is only good for a small area close to ␩ϭ0,6 it is

reasonable to focus our attention on eliminating all the spu-

rious ␦␴ terms in Eq. ͑18͒. Thus, we simply require the

solution of the following two equations:

III. FUNCTIONALS WITH A DOUBLE-DENSITY-DEPENDENT KERNEL

So far, we have only considered KEDF’s without any
density dependence in the kernels. We can of course intro-
duce density-dependence into the kernels, in the same spirit as Chaco´n and co-workers.8 Unfortunately, this comes at the
expense of greatly complicating the derivation and making a
straightforward numerical implementation computationally expensive, scaling quadratically with grid size.8 Nonetheless,
we will introduce a way around this problem in Sec. IV, and the scheme still scales as O(N ln N).

The speciﬁc choice of the two-body Fermi wave vector ␰␥(r,rЈ) is based on natural variable arguments;15 Eq. ͑22͒ clearly resembles Eq. ͑9͒.
After enforcing the exact LR at the uniform electron gas
limit as done in Eq. ͑10͒, one obtains the following universal
second-order differential equation for every ﬁxed value of q:

͑26͒ is fully consistent with Eq. ͑16͒ if the kernel is density-

independent, which simply removes the ﬁrst two terms in-

volving derivatives in the left-hand side of Eq. ͑26͒. Solving

this universal second-order differential equation is straight-

forward via standard techniques, such as a power series solution.18,19 Figure 1 compares one such density-dependent

able effect of the density-dependence on the kernel. Following the same procedure as given before,6 one can
consider the limits of the new KEDF for q→0 and q→ϱ.

This involves substituting the exact solution of Eq. ͑26͒ into

One can easily see the differences between Eqs. ͑17͒ and ͑27͒ and between Eqs. ͑18͒ and ͑29͒; the density-dependence in the kernel is responsible for the second terms in the denominators in Eqs. ͑28͒ and ͑30͒. Once again, we ﬁnd no single set of ͕␣,␤,␥͖ that simultaneously removes all spurious ␦␴ terms in Eqs. ͑27͒ and ͑29͒ and makes them reduce to the second-order CGE and the CLQL, respectively. How-
ever, the set ͕␣,␤͖ϭ͕5/6Ϯͱ5/6͖ is particularly attractive
because it forces Eq. ͑29͒ to yield the CLQL, which is more important than the q→0 limit ͑the second-order CGE͒.6 We can then use the third parameter ␥ to ﬁne-tune the behavior around the q→0 limit so that the effect of the spurious ␦␴ terms and the leading terms in Eq. ͑27͒ can be well balanced. Of course, for this given set of ͕␣,␤͖, enforcing the secondorder CGE can provide a value for ␥, but the effect of these spurious ␦␴ terms then cannot be simply controlled. This will be discussed further in Sec. V.

IV. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS
A. Hohenberg-Kohn self-consistent optimization The Hohenberg-Kohn20 ͑HK͒ total energy functional in
terms of ␳(r) is written as

Etot͓ ␳͔ϭTs͓ ␳͔ϩVne͓ ␳͔ϩJ͓ ␳͔ϩExc͓ ␳͔ϩVnn , ͑31͒
where Vne , J, Exc , and Vnn are the electron-nuclear attraction ͑including pseudopotentials͒, electron-electron Coulomb repulsion, electron exchange-correlation, and nuclear-nuclear Coulomb repulsion energy functionals, respectively. For a system with a ﬁxed number of electrons N, one can write down the functional ⌸͓␳͔:

where ␮ is the Lagrange multiplier. To determine the ground-state of the system, ⌸͓␳͔ must be minimized with respect to ␳(r). However, during the minimization process, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the positivity of ␳(r). This is not guaranteed in general if ␳(r) is used as the gen-
eralized coordinate in conventional optimization algorithms19 such as the steepest-descent or conjugate-
gradient methods. To circumvent this problem, one can work with a new variable ␸(r)

␳ ͑ r͒ ϭ ␸ 2͑ r͒ ,

͑33͒

which ensures a positive ␳(r) during the entire minimization. Based on a ﬁrst-order differential equation with a ﬁcti-

Here ␨ is a damping or friction coefﬁcient. We have found that this scheme is not only easy to implement, but also offers greater stability even when ⌬ becomes much larger than that of the simple steepest-descent method. We have also found that minimization algorithms based on the conjugate-gradient method actually converge faster, but require very accurate line minimizations that can be difﬁcult to implement. The Lagrange multiplier ␮ is determined dynamically by multiplying both sides of Eq. ͑38͒ by ␸n(r) and integrating over all space:

Note that since this scheme is purely based on ␳(r), only local pseudopotentials24,25 can be used to calculate the Vne term.

B. Evaluation of the density-dependent kernel
The presence of density-dependent terms inside the kernels in Eq. ͑21͒ makes a straightforward application of a fast Fourier transform ͑FFT͒ impossible. However, one can use a Taylor series expansion18 to factor out the density-dependence in the kernel. For example, the double-density-dependent kernel in real space can be written as ͑up to second order͒,

For maximum numerical efﬁciency, all derivative terms

of the kernel are kept in momentum space so that one FFT is

saved for each of their evaluations. For example, during the

evaluation of Eq. ͑15͒, the ﬁrst FFT can be avoided:

where V is the volume of the simulation cell. Now, the com-

putational cost has been reduced from scaling quadratically with grid size8 to scaling essentially linearly with the system size O(N ln N). The current scheme is only three times as

expensive as the conventional one based on the densityindependent kernel and linear-response theory.3–6 By contrast, the KEDF’s based on quadratic-response theory3,7 are

over ten times as expensive as the KEDF’s based on linearresponse theory with density-independent kernels.3–6

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
After the publication of our previous paper,6 we found that the real-space evaluation of ٌ␳(r) ͑needed for the evaluation of TvW͓␳͔) was strongly affected by the ﬁneness of the mesh chosen for a given simulation cell, the planewave cutoff ͑400 eV͒ used for the Goodwin-Needs-Heine local pseudopotential for aluminum25 was not sufﬁcient, and the Kohn-Sham ͑KS͒ calculations26 ͑used for comparison with the HK orbital-free calculations͒ had not been fully converged with respect to the k-point sampling.9 To remedy the ﬁrst problem, we now evaluate ٌ␳(r) in momentum space.27 This scheme is very stable ͑up to 0.001 eV͒ against changes of the mesh beyond a certain minimum mesh size. We also
increased the plane-wave cutoff to 600 eV, and converged the KS calculations with respect to the k-point sampling.9
The KS calculations were performed using the plane-wave DFT code CASTEP ͑Ref. 23͒ with the ﬁnest k-point sampling allowed by the code. The exchange-correlation effects were treated at the local-density approximation level.28 The corrections to our previous paper6 will be published as an erratum.29
As before, the hcp structure is included in the comparison,
since its energy is only slightly above the more stable fcc
structure and slightly below the less stable bcc structure,
making it an excellent test case for our trial KEDF’s. The experimentally well-characterized vacancy formation ͑vf͒ energy30 was also computed to further assess the quality of
the trial KEDF’s. The vf energy was calculated using both a four-site cell ͑3 atoms ϩ 1 vacancy͒ and a 32-site cell ͑31 atoms ϩ 1 vacancy͒ via the expression31
ͩ ͪ NϪ1 NϪ1
EvfϭE NϪ1,1, N V Ϫ N E͑ N,0,V ͒, ͑47͒

where E(N,n,V) is the energy of the system of N atoms and

n vacancies occupying (Nϩn) sites in a volume V. As the change in the vf energy due to ionic relaxation is minimal,31

we kept the lattice ﬁxed. Since our plane-wave cutoff and

k-point sampling are converged further than previous reports,31 we will use our KS vf numbers as the benchmark.

Tables I and II demonstrate that the inclusion of the

density-dependence in the kernel improves the performance

of KEDF’s. We do not include other KEDF’s whose ␣ϩ␤

Without

the

density-

dependence in the kernel, the KEDF’s do not even approach

the KS vf energies, since the order-of-magnitude change in

␳(r) in the vacancy region is most certainly not nearly-free-

electron-like. However, after the inclusion of the density-

dependence in the kernel, the KEDF’s show signiﬁcant im-

provement, especially for the vf energies, if the free

parameter ␥ is carefully tuned. Note also the tiny gaps be-

surfaces. Those KEDF’s without the density-dependence in

the kernel can be readily applied to such systems without any

numerical instability. However, Table III reveals that for the

same group of KEDF’s with density-independent kernels, the

surface energies are off by a factor of 2 compared with KS

predictions and the ͑110͒–͑100͒ ordering is reversed. A more

a highly undesirable feature. However, Figs. 3–5 clearly

show that ␳(r) obtained from the solution of the selfconsistent Thomas-Fermi-like equation,10,13,20 Eq. ͑41͒,

closely matches the KS ␳(r) for every case of the aluminum

low-index fcc surfaces ͑100͒, ͑110͒, and ͑111͒. This suggests

that the kinetic-energy potentials, ␦Ts͓␳͔/␦␳(r), of the simpler KEDF’s based on a density-independent kernel are of

high quality. This further supports the utility of such KEDF’s in the recently proposed embedding formalism32 that uses

density-dependent kernels refuses to converge because the

second-order Taylor series expansion in Eq. ͑42͒ makes too

nels not only converge properly, but also bring the surface

energies much closer to the KS results ͑Table III͒, including

reproducing the correct ordering of the surface stabilities.

Figures 3–5 also depict some non-trivial improvements in

the density proﬁles. This surprising success stems from the

smallness of the fast-decaying density outside the surface

slab, which actually suppresses the error made in the ﬁnite

Taylor series expansion in Eq. ͑42͒.

It is also intriguing to see relative contributions of differ-

ent orders in the Taylor series expansion of the kernel, Eq.

͑42͒, to the surface energy. Table IV shows that zeroth and

ﬁrst orders contribute most while second order only accounts

for less than 2% of the total surface energy. This is a clear

sign of convergence of the second-order Taylor series expan-

sion, even for large density variations.

Of course, there is still room for further improvement. It

remains to be seen whether the free parameter ␥ is system-

independent. More applications and tests are surely neces-

sary. Ideally, struction of

O(N ln N) scaling may then be impossible. More likely, one

would end up with a method with O(N2) scaling, as Chaco´n

and co-workers have developed.8 An O(N ln N) method without ␳0 in the construction is under development at this time; the details of which will be reported later.33
VI. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have devised a family of kinetic-energy density functionals which further generalize and improve upon the Wang-Teter, Perrot, Smargiassi-Madden, and Wang-Govind-Carter kinetic-energy density functionals.3–7 These functionals are still based on linear-response theory. The simple, effective implementation scheme for the nearly free electron gas delivers O(N ln N) scaling even for the double-density-dependent kernel. Numerical tests show that, compared with those kinetic-energy density functionals based on quadratic-response theory,3,7 our functionals can yield similar results for bulk solids, but with a lower computational cost and simpler implementation. More interestingly, all KEDF’s regardless of their kernels’ density dependence are seen to have very high-quality ␦Ts͓␳͔/␦␳(r), even for large density variations as at realistic surfaces. This lends credence to their use in the recently developed embedding method that offers a systematic means of improving upon the Kohn-Sham description13,26 in a local region.32 In addition, we have shown how the surface energy can be greatly improved by a simple, yet reasonable choice of average density. Finally, utilizing our functionals in O(N ln N) methods of ﬁrst-principles molecular dynamics2,5,7 has a promising future.
