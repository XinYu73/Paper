Abstract

We improve the linear tetrahedron method to overcome systematic errors due to overestimations (underestimations) in integrals for convex (concave) functions, respectively. Our method is applicable to various types of calculations such as the total energy, the charge (spin) density, response functions, and the phonon frequency, in contrast with the Blöchl correction, which is applicable to only the first two. We demonstrate the ability of our method by calculating phonons in MgB 2 and fcc lithium.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

    Two kinds of approximations of the matrix element. True and approximated matrix elements are depicted as black dash-doted lines and red solid lines, respectively; the black points indicate the matrix elements for a given value of ; the dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the tetrahedra. (a) The liner interpolated function is always smaller (larger) than the true function in the case of a convex (concave) function. (b) The leveled linear function is a better approximation of the true function.

    Points for constructing a third-order interpolation function (parallel stereogram). Red points denote the corners of . The blue and green points are explained in Table .

    Left: The Mg-centered Wigner-Seits cell of MgB. Green and purple spheres indicate Mg and B atoms respectively. The orbital (blue and red isosurfaces of opposite signs) and the displacement pattern of the intralayer vibrational mode of the B atoms with wave number at the point (arrows) are also depicted. Right: Schematic illustration of the Fermi surfaces of the bands; the red arrow indicates the momentum vector of a phonon at the point which connects occupied (O) and unoccupied (U) regions in the vicinity of the Fermi surface.

    Left: convergences of the frequencies of the intralayer vibrational mode of the B atoms at the point in the BZ for MgB (top) and the lower transverse acoustic mode at the point in the BZ for fcc Li at 20 GPa (bottom) with a different integration method. The upward-pointing and downward-pointing triangles with red and green solid lines are the results of the linear and improved tetrahedron methods; the plus signs, multiplication signs, squares, and diamonds with blue, purple, cyan, and black dashed lines denote the results of the broadening method for widths of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 Ry, respectively. Lines are guides for the eyes. Right: The frequency of these modes converged about the number of at each broadening width (circles with orange line); the green solid lines indicate the converged value obtained by our method.

    The convergences of (top), (middle), and from McMillan's formula (bottom) of MgB (left) and fcc Li (right) calculated using and with different integration schemes; the upward-pointing and downward-pointing triangles with red and green solid lines are the results of the linear and improved tetrahedron methods; the diamonds, plus signs, multiplication signs, squares, and circles with gray, blue, purple, black, and cyan dashed lines denote the results of broadening methods of widths 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 Ry respectively. Lines are guides for the eyes.
