We investigate the relation between the entanglement and the robustness of a multipartite system to a depolarization noise. We ﬁnd that the robustness of a two-qubit system in an arbitrary pure state depends completely on its entanglement. However, this is not always true in a three-qubit system. There is a residual effect on the robustness of a three-qubit system in an arbitrary superposition of a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state. Its entanglement determines the trend of its robustness. However, there is a splitting on its robustness under the same entanglement. Its robustness not only has the same periodicity as its three-tangle but also alters with its three-tangle synchronously. There is also a splitting on the robustness of an n-qubit (n > 3) system although it is more complicated.

Entanglement is the most nonclassical feature of quantum mechanics and it plays an important role in quantum computation and communication [1]. However, an entangled quantum system is inevitably immersed in an environment and interacts with it in some way, which usually degrades the entanglement of the system. This decoherence introduces some disadvantages on multiqubit entanglement creation and manipulation in quantum information processing. Recently, some works showed that entanglement sudden death (ESD) [2,3], a peculiar dynamical feature of entangled states, may takes place in an entangled system. In detail, the entanglement of an entangled system may disappear at a ﬁnite time although the constituent parts of an entangled state decay asymptotically in time. This interesting phenomenon has been observed in a two-qubit optical system [4,5].
Recently, some groups have studied the robustness of mulitqubit quantum systems. For example, in 1999, Vidal and Tarrach [6] investigated the robustness of two-qubit systems by considering the minimal amount of mixing with locally prepared states which washes out all entanglement. In 2002, Simon and Kempe [7] showed that the robustness of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement increases with the number of qubits, under local decoherence, modeled by partially depolarizing channels acting independently on each qubit. They also pointed out that the amount of entanglement of a multiqubit system and its robustness do not have a simple relation. In 2008, Aolita et al. [8] showed clearly that the time at which such entanglement of a pure GHZ-state quantum system becomes arbitrarily small is inversely proportional to N, although its ESD time increases with N . In 2008, Batle and Casas [9] found that the entanglement in a three-qubit system with the measure of Mermin’s inequality [10] and its robustness contain similarities, but do not have a simple relation. In 2009, Liu and Fan [11] investigated the decay of entanglement of a generalized N -qudit GHZ state under local decoherence and obtained results similar to those reported in Refs. [7,8]. In 2009, Borras et al. [12] investigated the

decay of the amount of entanglement of a multqubit system experiencing a decoherence process.
In this article, we investigate the relation between the entanglement and the robustness of a multipartite system to a depolarization noise. For a two-qubit system in an arbitrary pure entangled state, its robustness increases synchronously with its entanglement. For a three-qubit system, this phenomenon, however, disappears and the robustness of GHZlike states, which have only three-tangle (the entanglement shared by all the three qubits) without concurrence, is the upper boundary of symmetrical three-qubit pure states. It is interesting to point out that there is a residual effect on the robustness of a three-qubit system in an arbitrary superposition of a GHZ state and a W state. Its entanglement, on the one hand, determines the trend of its robustness. On the other hand, there is a splitting on its robustness. Its robustness not only has the same periodicity as its three-tangle but also alters with its three-tangle synchronously. This interesting phenomenon takes place in a four-qubit system and a ﬁve-qubit system, but there is not a good measure on their entanglements shared by all the qubits in this time.
In the present study, each qubit in multiqubit entangled quantum systems is coupled to its own environment individually. That is, our study is under local decoherence, modeled by partially depolarizing channels acting independently on each qubit, the same as that in Ref. [7]. The dynamics of each qubit in a three-particle entangled quantum system is governed by a master equation from which one can obtain a completely positive trace-preserving map ε which describes the corresponding evolution [12]: ρi(t) = ε(t)ρi(0). In the Born-Markovian approximation the maps (or channels) can be described using its Kraus representation [12,13], that is,

where Ej (t) (j = 1,2,3) are the so-called Kraus operators needed to completely characterize the channel. In detail, the partially depolarizing channel Cd for each qubit is deﬁned by applying the completely depolarizing channel with a probability d and applying the identity transformation

First we explore the connection between the entanglement
of a two-qubit quantum system and its robustness and then
generalize it in a three-qubit system.
Under the depolarized noise Cd shown in Eq. (2) on each qubit, the robustness of a given n-party entangled state ρ is
deﬁned as the critical amount of depolarization dcrit where Cd⊗n(ρ) becomes separable or—in the absence of a necessary and sufﬁcient condition—ceases to fulﬁll certain sufﬁcient
conditions for entanglement [7,14–16]. The entanglement
(negativity N) of a quantum system in an arbitrary pure
state can be obtained with the method in Refs. [17–19] and its robustness (R = dcrit) can be calculated with the PPT criterion [14]. Negativity of a bipartite quantum system is deﬁned as N = |λi|, where λi are the negative eigenvalues of ρTB and TB denotes the partial transpose with respect to the subsystem B. For an arbitrary bipartite pure state,
its entanglement is completely determined by its Schmidt
coefﬁcients, and the depolarizing channel is basis independent.
We ﬁnd that there is a simple analytical expression for the
relation between N and R of a two-qubit system in an arbitrary
pure state; that is,

R=1− √ 1 .

That is, its robustness depends completely on its entanglement.

For a three-qubit system, there are two inequivalent classes

of genuine tripartite entanglement [20], represented by the
GHZ state |GHZ = √1 (|000 + |111 ) and the W state |W =
2
√1 (|001 + |010 + |100 ). Each three-qubit pure state can be
3
converted into either a GHZ-class state or a W -class state

by stochastic local quantum operations assisted by classical

communication (SLOCC) [20,21]. Our question is whether

or not a three-qubit quantum system has the same result as

a two-qubit quantum system. That is, is there the explicit

phenomenon that the more the entanglement of a three-qubit

entangled pure state, the more its robustness?

As the depolarizing channel is symmetric to each qubit in

a three-qubit system, we consider two classes of symmetric

pure states, which are invariable under the permutations of the

three particles, to study the relation between their robustness

and their entanglements, that is, the GHZ-like state | and

the W -like state | ,

FIG. 1. (Color online) The relation between the robustness and the negativity of a three-qubit system in a GHZ-like state, a W -like state, and a symmetrical three-qubit pure state is shown with a solid (red) line, a dashed (magenta) line, or a solid (black) dot, respectively. For a G√HZ-like state, negativity ∈ [0,1]. For a W -like state, negativity ∈ [0, 2 3 2 ].
where a,b ∈ [0,1]. The relations between the entanglements and the robustness of the states | and | are plotted with the solid (red) line and the dashed (magenta) line, respectively, in Fig. 1. For each class of entangled states, on the one hand, the more the entanglement, the more its robustness. On the other hand, the GHZ-like state | ABC is more robust than the W -like state | ABC with the same entanglement under the depolarizing channel Cd⊗3.
More generally, an arbitrary symmetrical three-qubit entangled pure state can be written as
| ABC = c1|000 + c2 √1 {|001 + |010 + |100 } 3
+ c3 √1 {|110 + |101 + |011 } + c4|111 , (7) 3
where c1, c2, c3, and c4 are four complex numbers and satisfy |c1|2 + |c2|2 + |c3|2 + |c4|2 = 1. We choose randomly a great number of symmetrical three-qubit entangled pure states with the Haar measure [22] and calculate their negativity. With a numerical simulation, we give the relation between the entanglement and the robustness in symmetrical three-qubit pure states | ABC in Fig. 1 with solid black dots. Different from two-qubit states, the robustness of a symmetrical three-qubit state does not only depend on its negativity. Generally speaking, the more the entanglement, the more the robustness of a symmetrical three-qubit pure state. However, one can see that there is a subset of states which have the same entanglement but different robustness. Moreover, the GHZ-like state is more robust than others under the same entanglement. That is, the robustness of GHZ-like states, which have only three-tangle [23–25] (it is called originally the residual entanglement [23]) without concurrence, is the upper boundary of symmetrical three-qubit pure states, but W -like states without three-tangle are not the most fragile

ones. This phenomenon implies that the three-tangle is the

highest quality (the most robust) entanglement against the

depolarization noise.

In a three-qubit system, the negativity only measures

a bipartite entanglement, while the three-tangle quantiﬁes

genuine multipartite correlations. In order to explore the

role of different entanglement components (three-tangle or

negativity) in robustness of a three-qubit system, we should

study the robustness of a class of three-qubit pure states

which have the same entanglement and different robustness.

Fortunately, we ﬁnd that the superpositions of the GHZ state

and the W state have different robustness under the same

entanglement (negativity), that is,

|Z(a,ϕ)

√ − eiϕ 1 − a|W

.

(8)

The parameter a ∈ [0,1] is used to identify the proportion of

the GHZ state and ϕ is used to represent the relative phase

between the GHZ state and the W state. The negativities of

these three-qubit systems can be described as

√

N [|Z(a,ϕ) ] =

5a2 − 4a + 8 .

It is obvious that the entanglement of the state |Z(a,ϕ) does

not depend on the phase factor ϕ. The relation between its

entanglement and the coefﬁcient a is shown in the left inset

in Fig. 2. However, its robustness depends on not only the

coefﬁcient a but also the phase factor ϕ, shown in Fig. 2 for the cases ϕ = π/3, 2π/9, 2π/15, π/15, and 0. Moreover, its robustness R[|Z(a,ϕ) ] varies periodically with the phase ϕ;

that is,

R[|Z(a,ϕ) ] = R[|Z(a,ϕ + 2π/3) ].

The periods of the robustness T = 2π/3. In each period,

R[|Z(a,π/3 − ϕ + nT ) ] = R[|Z(a,π/3 + ϕ + nT ) ],

where ϕ ∈ [0,π/3] and n = 0,1,2, . . . .

inset shows the three-tangle of the state |Z(a,ϕ) versus the coefﬁcient

a with different phase factors ϕ.

With a given coefﬁcient a, which means that the states |Z(a,ϕ) have the same components of the GHZ state and the W state, the larger the phase ϕ, the greater the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) in each period. With a given phase factor ϕ, the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) appears to have two different effects. When ϕ is small, a tripartite quantum system in the state |Z(a,ϕ) appears to have a normal robustness effect in which its robustness alters synchronously with its negativity. That is, its robustness decreases with the coefﬁcient a when a 0.4 and increases with a when a > 0.4, same as its negativity. However, an abnormal robustness effect takes place when ϕ becomes large. Speciﬁcally, the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) alters inversely with its negativity when a is not large. In principle, it is explicit that there is a splitting on the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) , which is completely different from its negativity. The ﬂuctuation of the robustness is at most 4%. That is, the negativity of a three-qubit system determines the trend of its robustness. Also, there is a residual effect on the robustness although the ﬂuctuation is small.
It is interesting to point out that the period of the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) agrees with that of its three-tangle. For the state |Z(a,ϕ) , its three-tangle can be calculated as [25]
√ τ [|Z(a,ϕ) ] = a2 − 8 6 a(1 − a)3e3iϕ . (10)

It is periodic in the phase ϕ with the same period of Tτ = T = 2π/3 as the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) , shown in the right insert in Fig. 2 for the cases ϕ = π/3, 2π/9, 2π/15, π/15, and
0. Also, in each period,

τ [|Z(a,π/3 − ϕ + nT ) ] = τ [|Z(a,π/3 + ϕ + nT ) ].

In order to show explicitly the effect of the three-tangle on

the the robustness of the state |Z(a,ϕ) , we give the relation

between the robustness R and the phase ϕ and that between

τ and the phase ϕ under a given coefﬁcient a = 0.2, 0.4,

and 0.6, shown in Fig. 3. For a state |Z(a,ϕ) under a given

coefﬁcient a, both its robustness and its three-tangle τ increase

with the phase ϕ when 0 ϕ π/3 and decrease with the

phase ϕ when π/3 ϕ 2π/3. That is, the robustness and

the three-tangle have the same monotonicity.

For a four-qubit√system state |Z(a,ϕ) n = a|GHZ

and n−

a ﬁ√ve-qubit system in the eiϕ 1 − a|W n (n = 4,5),

there is also the phenomenon as a three-qubit sys-

tem. That is, there is a splitting on its robust-

ness.

studies on n-tangle (n 4, that is, the entanglement shared by

all the n qubits). For two-qubit systems, their entanglements

are just the ones shared by both the qubits, and the robustness of

each two-qubit pure state depends completely on its negativity.

In summary, we have investigated the relation between the

entanglement and the robustness of a multipartite system to

a depolarized noise. For a two-qubit system in an arbitrary

pure entangled state, its negativity determines completely its

robustness. For a three-qubit system in a general symmetrical

pure state, the trend of its robustness is, on the one hand, determined by its entanglement. The robustness of GHZ-like states, which have only three-tangle without concurrence, is

the upper boundary of symmetrical three-qubit pure states, which implies that the three-tangle is the highest quality entanglement against the depolarization noise. On the other hand, there is a residual effect on the robustness. That is, the robustness of a three-qubit system in an arbitrary superposition of a GHZ state and a W state not only has the same periodicity as its three-tangle but also alters with its three-tangle synchronously. There is also a splitting on the robustness of a four-qubit system and a ﬁve-qubit system although there is not a good measure for their n-tangle (n = 4,5).
One should certainly be careful in drawing general conclusions about the robustness and the entanglement of a multipartite system. Nevertheless, our results show that the three-tangle affects the robustness of a three-qubit system as they have the same periodicity and monotonicity but not the extent. Moreover, the splitting on the robustness of a system with more than three qubits provides an open question for people to study the deﬁnition of the entanglement shared by all the qubits. Also, it may give some useful information about decoherence in quantum information processing. On the other hand, are there other factors that affect the robustness of multiqubit systems? Does this phenomenon exist in highdimensional systems or not? These are still some open questions of interest to us.
