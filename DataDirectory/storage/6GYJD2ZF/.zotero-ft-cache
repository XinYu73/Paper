Abstract: Lithium (Li) metal is the most promising electrode for next-generation rechargeable batteries. However, the challenges induced by Li dendrites on a working Li metal anode hinder the practical applications of Li metal batteries. Herein, nitrogen (N) doped graphene was adopted as the Li plating matrix to regulate Li metal nucleation and suppress dendrite growth. The N-containing functional groups, such as pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen in the N-doped graphene, are lithiophilic, which guide the metallic Li nucleation causing the metal to distribute uniformly on the anode surface. As a result, the Ndoped graphene modified Li metal anode exhibits a dendritefree morphology during repeated Li plating and demonstrates a high Coulombic efficiency of 98 % for near 200 cycles.
With the booming advances in high-end electronic devices,
high-energy-density batteries are needed to alleviate concerns about battery endurance.[1,2] Since the Li metal anode possesses an ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860 mA h gÀ1) and the lowest negative electrochemical potential (À3.040 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode), Li metal batteries (LMBs) are therefore recognized as one of the most promising candidates.[1] However, the formation of Li dendrites during repeated Li plating/stripping cycles will not only induce many “dead Li” with capacity loss, but also have the potential to cause internal short circuit and other hazardous issues.[1,3] Therefore, Li dendrites and their related issues severely hinder the practical applications of LMBs.
To address these issues, significant progress has been achieved recently, in areas including liquid electrolyte modifications,[4] artificial electrode/electrolyte films,[5] solid-state[6] or polymer[7] electrolytes, hybrid electrolytes,[8] and nanostructured anodes with high surface areas.[9] However, these result-oriented approaches mainly concentrate on the already obtained Li plating morphology induced by existing methods, but less involve the initial nucleation process. Actually, the final morphology critically depends on the initial nucleating behavior. Systematic investigation of Li metal nucleation

behavior is of great significance. Suppressing Li dendrite growth at the nucleating stages is expected to lead to a safe and efficient LMB and offer a mechanistic understanding of the working Li metal battery as well.
Very recently, Cui and co-workers[10] have conducted experimental work to consider the initial nucleation stage of Li deposition. The Li nuclei size is heavily dependent on the current density, confirming the effectiveness of reducing the local current density by introducing a high-surface-area Li plating matrix.[10] More importantly, the nucleation sites greatly rely on the type of Li plating matrix and a “lithiophilic” matrix is preferred for Li metal nucleation with a reduced polarization. A “lithiophilic” matrix that has a good metallic Li affinity can be wet by molten Li, which indicates a strong binding energy between Li atoms and the surface of the matrix. Therefore, designing a Li plating matrix with a high surface area and lithiophilic surface makes much sense for a safe and efficient Li metal anode.
Herein we report a nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) matrix with densely and uniformly distributed lithiophilic functional groups designed to guide Li metal nucleation and growth. The NG can inhibit Li dendrite growth by regulating Li nucleation sizes and sites. The electrochemical performance of NGbased Li metal anodes was therefore improved with dendritefree Li deposits in a working battery.
The nucleation and plating processes of metallic Li on NG-based and Cu foil-based current collector are schematically illustrated in Figure 1. Li ions start to migrate toward anode surface under the dual effect of the electric field and concentration gradient at the beginning of Li plating. The Li ions that reach the current-collector surface will acquire electrons and start nucleation. When employing Cu foil (a general control sample in the research of Li metal anodes) as

the current collector, the nucleation sites for Li plating are isolated and randomly distributed owing to the heterogeneous and rough surface of the Cu foil, which tends to induce a non-uniform Li deposition. Since the Cu foil is not lithiophilic, the overpotential for metallic Li plating on the Cu foil surface is much higher than that on a Li-metal surface. Thus on Cu, Li atoms are more likely to continuously deposit on existed Li nucleation deposits, hence resulting in a dendritic morphology.[10] In the following growth stage, Li nucleation deposits mainly grow in the direction away from the surface and eventually form large Li dendrites, controlled by the combined effect of the electric field and the concentration gradient.[11] When employing a N-doped graphene framework as the Li plating matrix, both the plating process and final morphology are significantly improved. The surface of N-doped graphene is full of lithiophilic functional groups, such as pyridinic, pyrrolic, and quaternary nitrogen atoms, offering much more uniform nucleation sites and a smaller nucleation overpotential than the Cu foil surface. Therefore, metallic Li deposits preferentially on the N-doped graphene surface. When complete, the surface of the NG will be covered with uniform and smooth Li deposits.
The NG employed herein was synthesized by treating graphene in ammonia under 600 8C for 4 h.[12] The as-obtained NG has a nitrogen content of 3.14 atom % as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The fitting result of the N 1s fine scan spectra exhibits three peaks (Figure 2 a), assigned to pyridinic nitrogen (pnN, 398.5 eV), pyrrolic nitrogen (prN, 400.2 eV), and quaternary nitrogen (qN, 402.1 eV). Quaternary nitrogen in the bulk phase (qnN) was not obtained according to XPS (Figure 2 b). Both pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen are the two main components among these N-containing functional groups in these NG scaffolds.
To probe the metallic-Li deposition process and the interactions between the Li atom and Cu or different functional groups, binding energy and charge density analyses were conducted based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Figure 2 c). There is only a weak interaction between Li atom and Cu slab (Figure 2 d and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In contrast, the edge and highcoordination sites in graphene and NG with functional groups are preferred for Li atoms adsorption (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Pyrrolic nitrogen and pyridinic nitrogen exhibit relatively larger binding energies of À4.46 and À4.26 eV than graphene of À3.64 eV and Cu of À2.57 eV. The local charge density between pyrrolic nitrogen and Li atom is increased (Figure 2 e,f), indicating the strong interaction between Li and N atoms. Note that there is one extra electron in the pyrrolic nitrogen group, in which N provides a pair of p-electrons to conjugated p bond, while there are lone-pair electrons in the pyridinic nitrogen. The NG nanosheets with extra pair of electrons are expected as electron-rich donors with filled p orbitals that naturally act as Lewis base sites to strongly adsorb Lewis acidic Li ions in electrolytes through acid–base interactions, guiding the metallic Li nuclei to uniformly distribute on the anode surface.[13] However, the quaternary nitrogen (both qN and qnN) with saturated electron orbitals is not able to afford extra lone-pair electrons for adsorbing Li atoms, resulting in a relatively weak binding energy (Fig-

ure 2 c). The main nitrogen-containing functional groups of the NG employed are pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen, thus, the surface of NG can have a strong interaction with Li atoms. A stronger binding energy of Li atoms can always lead to a better adsorption of Li ions (Figure S3). Therefore, Li ions are expected to adsorb and plate as metallic Li atoms on the lithiophilic sites related to these nitrogen-containing functional groups. In addition, according to our calculations the doped N atoms cannot react with plated Li atoms to form Li3N (Figure S2, Supporting Information), which means that the doped N atoms possess electrochemical stability in LMBs.
To directly demonstrate the lithiophilicity of such NG materials, surface wetting experiments of molten Li on Cu, graphene, and NG have been conducted (Figure S4). For NG material, the molten Li can wet and spread onto the NG surface giving a smaller contact angle than that on Cu and graphene surface.
Furthermore, nucleation overpotentials are employed to evaluate the degree of lithiophilicity on the electrode surface quantitatively. There is a certain overpotential between the two electrodes in the galvanostatic electrochemical deposition of metallic Li. A part of this overpotential is induced by

the mass-transfer resistance, which is present

throughout the whole metal-Li deposition process.

The mass-transfer overpotential is mainly affected by

the current density and the migration properties of Li

ions in electrolyte. The other part is the nucleation

overpotential, which exists only in the short nuclea-

tion stage at the beginning of deposition. The

nucleation overpotential is necessary for metallic Li

to deposit on the surface of the heterogeneous

electrode. The nucleation overpotential mainly

depends on the lithiophilicity of the electrode surface. Some metals, such as Au and Ag, that form an alloy with Li metal can provide a zero nucleation potential.[14]

smaller than that of Cu foil electrode. Owing to the

lithiophilic nitrogen containing functional groups in N-

doped graphene, the NG electrode exhibits lower resistance

for metallic Li to plate at the electrode surface, instead of

plating on Li deposits to form long dendrites.

Of note is that the specific surface area of NG is

380.7 m2 gÀ1 (Figure S5), which significantly reduces the

local current density to minimize the overpotential. To

exclude the effect of the high-surface-area of the scaffolds

on Li nucleation in the NG, the nucleation overpotential of

graphene (G, the raw materials for NG, with a similar specific

surface area of 380.2 m2 gÀ1) is measured to be 0.029 V at the

same current density of 0.05 mA cmÀ2. This nucleation over-

potential is between these of Cu foil and NG electrodes,

demonstrating that the introduction of nitrogen-containing

functional groups indeed facilitates the Li nuclei formation on

NG electrodes, not merely contributed by the high specific

surface area. Since the nitrogen-containing functional groups

endow NG with the lithiophilic surface, the N content directly

affects the lithiophilicity of NG. The surface of NG becomes

more lithiophilic with the higher N content, which brings

a lower nucleation overpotential. However, a too high N

content may destroy the conjugate structure of graphene and

then reduce the electrical conductivity, which is not beneficial

to Li deposition.

The nucleation potentials at different current densities ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 mA cmÀ2 were also investigated
(Figure 3 b and Figure S6). The mn on NG electrode increases from 0.017 to 0.036 V with the increase in current density,
which is much slower than that on Cu foil electrode from

energy of Li atom with Cu foil and N-doped graphene, we consider that some of the nitrogen containing functional groups like pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen play the key role in making N-doped graphene a lithiophilic matrix, which can lead Li ions to adsorb and Li atoms to deposit uniformly on the electrode surface.
In summary, we have performed proof-of-concept investigations on a novel matrix containing uniform lithiophilic sites to regulate metallic Li nucleation and suppress Li dendrite growth. With the lithiophilic nitrogen-containing functional groups, such as pyridinic nitrogen and pyrrolic nitrogen, the N-doped graphene can regulate the nucleation process of metallic Li electrodeposition. As a result, dendritefree Li metal deposits were obtained, which make the Ndoped graphene electrodes exhibit an impressive electrochemical performance. The Coulombic efficiency of the Ndoped graphene electrode at a current density of 1.0 mA cmÀ2 and a cycle capacity of 1.0 mA h cmÀ2 can be maintained at 98 % for nearly 200 cycles. The strategy emphasizes the importance of Li nucleation on the Li plating morphology, which can suppress Li-dendrite growth at a sprouting stage. The prospects presented herein can shed a new light on Li metal deposition and are instructional to other metal batteries as well.
