We improve the linear tetrahedron method to overcome systematic errors due to overestimations (underestimations) in integrals for convex (concave) functions, respectively. Our method is applicable to various types of calculations such as the total energy, the charge (spin) density, response functions, and the phonon frequency, in contrast with the Blo¨chl correction, which is applicable to only the ﬁrst two. We demonstrate the ability of our method by calculating phonons in MgB2 and fcc lithium.

I. INTRODUCTION
In calculations of periodic systems on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) [1], integrals of matrix elements over the Brillouin zone (BZ) are evaluated to obtain various physical quantities of solids including the total energy, the electron (spin) density, the density of states, response functions, and the phonon frequency. Since this integral with respect to the Bloch wave vector k is replaced with a summation over a range of points described by a discrete variable k, approximation schemes employed for this summation can signiﬁcantly affect the accuracy and computational costs. Accurate integration using a modest number of k points is even more important for hybrid-DFT [2] and GW approximations [3], because in these cases the computational cost is proportional to the square of the number of k points, whereas standard semilocal approximations have a linear dependence.
There are two kinds of schemes to perform such an integration over the k points, namely, the broadening method [4] and the tetrahedron method [5]. In the broadening method, we replace the delta function with a smeared function which has a ﬁnite broadening width; we have to check the convergences about both the broadening width and the number of k points to obtain accurate results. In the tetrahedron method, we perform analytical integration in tetrahedral regions covering the BZ with the piecewise linear interpolation of a matrix element. Unlike the broadening method, we have to check the convergence only about the number of k points. The tetrahedron method is applied to calculations of susceptibility [6], phonon frequency [7], phonon line width [8], and the local Green’s function as part of the dynamical mean ﬁeld theory in the Hubbard model [9].
However, the tetrahedron method has a drawback: if a matrix element Ak is a convex (concave) function of k, this method systematically overestimates (underestimates) its contribution to the integral due to the linear interpolation involved. Although this can be avoided by using the quadratic interpolation, we cannot perform analytical integration straightforwardly in such a case. The Blo¨chl correction [10] was invented to overcome this issue by utilizing the following two facts: (i) the difference between the linear interpolation integration and that using the quadratic interpolation is approximately proportional to the

second derivative of Ak integrated over the occupied region; (ii) although ∂2Ak/∂k2 cannot be evaluated within the framework of linear interpolation, we can perform the volume integral by replacing it with the Fermi surface integration of the ﬁrst derivative of Ak (which can be evaluated by linear interpolation) using the Gauß theorem. Using this method we can reduce the number of k points to obtain converged results for total energies and charge densities. However, in the calculation of response functions or phonon frequencies, the integral k< F d3kAk/( F − k) appears, where Ak is an arbitrary function of k. In this case, the Blo¨chl correction is inapplicable because we cannot perform the Fermi surface integration when ∂(Ak/( F − k))/∂k is singular.
In this work, we develop a newly improved tetrahedron method that is applicable to calculations involving integrations of functions with singularities on the Fermi surfaces. It is constructed by means of a higher order interpolation and the least-squares method. We apply our method to the BZ integration in calculations of phonon frequencies based on density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [11]. Following that we successfully calculate the frequency of phonons in MgB2 and fcc Li. In contrast, it is difﬁcult to achieve convergence in this calculation using conventional methods because the phonons in these materials couple strongly with electrons in the vicinity of Fermi surfaces [12,13]. In Sec. II, we describe our new tetrahedron method in detail after summarizing the conventional linear tetrahedron method and the Blo¨chl correction. Section III shows how our method improves the convergence about the number of k points in the calculation of phonons, followed by the conclusion in Sec. IV.
II. METHOD
In this section, we introduce our new tetrahedron method; we begin with the standard linear tetrahedron method and the Blo¨chl correction to explain why these methods are not necessarily efﬁcient in calculating response functions such as phonon frequencies.
A. The linear tetrahedron method and its drawbacks
We overview the general procedure of the tetrahedron method and its drawbacks. We calculate the integral

this subcell is partitioned with the uniform k-point mesh; for
convenience, we number the corners of each tetrahedron from
1 to 4 along speciﬁc edges of the subcell (see Fig. 1). The

However, linear interpolation has a drawback: if the matrix
element AT (s) is a convex function within the tetrahedron T , the interpolated function A1T (s) becomes A1T (s) AT (s) in T ; hence, the integral is systematically overestimated. If AT (s) is a concave function, the sign of the inequality is reversed [see
Fig. 2(a)].

B. The Blo¨chl correction and its limitation In the special case that the integral (1) becomes

(7)

we can overcome the drawback of the linear tetrahedron
method by considering the curvature of Ak within the framework of the linear interpolation [10]; this type of integration
appears in the calculations of total energies or charge (spin)
densities. In this case, we can evaluate the difference between the integral (7) with the linear interpolation of Ak (Alin) and that with the quadratic interpolation (Aquad) as follows. First,

C. A newly improved tetrahedron method applicable
to response functions
The systematic error of the tetrahedron method is a result of the linear interpolation. Although we can avoid this problem if we use higher order interpolation, the integral (2) becomes unsolvable analytically. The real question is, how can we improve the linear approximation of the matrix elements? The answer is to employ leveling rather than interpolating [see Fig. 2(b)]. The procedure is explained below.
(1) We construct the N th polynomial ANT (s) from Ak and k using the corners of a tetrahedron T and some additional surrounding points for sampling.

(2) We ﬁt a linear function

ALT SM (s) = A¯1(1 − x − y − z) + A¯2x + A¯3y + A¯4z (13)
into ANT (s) through the least-squares method (LSM); that is to say, we solve

(s).

(4) We evaluate integral (2) replacing AT (s) and T (s) with

ALT SM (s) and

LSM T

(s),

respectively.

(5) We repeat the above steps for all tetrahedra.

Although the approximated matrix element ALT SM (s) is discontinuous at boundaries of tetrahedra [see Fig. 2(b)], it is of

no concern because we are interested only in the integrated

value.

D. Implementation
We use a third-order polynomial A3T (s) as ANT (s) in our implementation. The sampling points used to construct A3T (s) are the corners of the tetrahedron T (4 points) and the other 16 points given in Table I and Fig. 3. As a result, A3T (s) becomes

III. COMPARISON WITH OTHER INTEGRATION SCHEMES FOR ACTUAL CALCULATIONS

We implement our method in an ab initio electronic

structure calculation code QUANTUM ESPRESSO [14] which uses

plane waves to represent Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals. Then, we

test the effectiveness of the method through calculations of

phonons in two systems, MgB2 [15] and fcc lithium at a high

pressure (20 GPa), based on DFPT [11] (Appendix A).

Magnesium diboride has the highest TC (about 40 K)

out of the known phonon-type superconductors. Many ab

initio studies have been performed since it was discovered

[12,16–19], revealing that the high TC is a result of the strong interaction between intralayer vibrations of B atoms

and their covalent bonding orbitals (σ bands) (Fig. 4). This

strong coupling also softens phonon frequencies due to the

screening of the ion-ion interaction; this screening occurs due

to linear responses of σ electrons in the vicinity of the Fermi

surfaces. We have to evaluate these responses accurately to

determine the phonon frequencies precisely. Lithium exhibits

a monatomic fcc structure at pressures between 7.5 and

39 GPa [20]. In this phase it becomes a superconductor. Its

TC increases with pressure up to 30 GPa [21–23] because

interaction. The lower couples with electrons

most strongly in this material [13]. In this test, we consider the

phonons of fcc Li at a pressure of 20 GPa.

We use norm-conserving pseudopotentials [24] in calcu-

lations of MgB2; the cutoff energy of plane waves is set

to 50 Ry. In the calculations of fcc lithium, we use an

ultrasoft pseudopotential [25]. We treat the electrons in the 1s

orbitals as valence electrons [26] and employ a cutoff energy

of 80 Ry. In both of these applications, we use the GGA-

PBE functional [27] and the ﬁrst-order Hermite-Gaussian

function [4,28] for broadening. We apply our method to the

calculation of the frequency of the intralayer vibrational mode

of B atoms at the A point in the BZ (Fig. 5, top left). The

result of the improved tetrahedron method converges faster

than that of the linear tetrahedron method; it converges with

approximately 123 k points. If we use a broadening method

with a small broadening width (0.01 Ry), the result converges

at an unrealistically large number of k points (about 503 k

points). On the other hand, using large broadening widths (0.03 Ry and 0.06 Ry), convergence occurs at a lower number of k points. However, results are far away from the one converged about the broadening width; the complicated dependence of the convergence on the broadening width is shown in the top-right panel of Fig. 5. The result cannot be represented by a simple function, so it is difﬁcult to extrapolate to a broadening width of zero.
The bottom left panel of Fig. 5 shows the k convergence of the lower transverse acoustic mode at the K point in the BZ for fcc Li at 20 GPa calculated with the different integration schemes. Our method achieves convergence very quickly; it requires only 163 k points. In this system, the result of the broadening method is very sensitive to the broadening width; the error due to broadening is more than 25% at a width of

0.05 Ry; hence, the broadening method is not suitable for this calculation.
We will show how the accuracy of the phonon calculations affects the prediction of the superconducting transition temperature within the framework of the following McMillan formula [29,30]:

gnqkνn k+q =

where Mτ is a mass of an ion, (ηqν)τα is the unit displacement pattern of the phonon (q,ν), |n,k is the KS orbital, and δvS/δRτα(q) is the linear response of the KS potential with respect to the distortion of the wave number q; τ and α are indices of an ion in the unit cell and a direction in the Cartesian coordinate, respectively. Although there are more precise methods to calculate TC such as density functional theory for superconductors [31,32], we use this simple formula because we are only interested in changes in the results due to the k integration in the phonon calculations.
To evaluate the integrals in (26) and (27), we use the linear tetrahedron method with a q grid of 6 × 6 × 4 (8 × 8 × 8) and a k grid of 24 × 24 × 18 (32 × 32 × 32) for MgB2 (fcc Li), respectively. Additionally, we calculate each ωqν and δvS/δRτα(q) with different k grids and different k integration schemes.
Figure 6 shows the result of λ, ωln, and TC from McMillan’s formula (μ∗ = 0.1); in both the MgB2 and Li cases, we obtain very fast k convergence using our method. Comparing the k converged result of our method to that of the broadening method with a width of 0.05 Ry, we can see a large overestimate of the phonon frequencies occurs when the broadening method is used, resulting in an underestimated λ and an overestimated ωln. Moreover, speeds of convergences about the broadening width for calculations of the λ and ωln are very slow; these results have not reach the convergence even for the broadening width of 0.01 Ry; if we use smaller broadening width (such as 0.005 Ry), we need an unrealistic number of k points to obtain the k-converged result.

IV. CONCLUSION
We introduced an improvement to the tetrahedron method based on the third-order interpolation and the least-squares method that reduces the number of k points required to obtain converged results of the BZ integrations. Our method is applicable to various kinds of k integration; in particular, it is efﬁcient for calculations of phonons and response functions because the associated computational costs are large and the Blo¨chl correction is not applicable to these calculations. We demonstrated this effectiveness through calculations of phonon frequencies in MgB2 and fcc Li.

APPENDIX A: CALCULATION OF WEIGHTS FOR DFPT

The integration weights for the DFPT calculations of phonon frequencies are different from those of the total energy, θ ( F − nk), or the density of states, δ( − nk). They are

Wn(1n)k

=

θ(

n k+q − F)θ ( F − nk − n k+q

nk) ,

(A1)

Wn(2n)k = θ ( F − nk)θ ( nk − n k+q ).

(A2)

In integrations with weights that contain products of two
step functions, only regions where both Heaviside functions

tetrahedra two times to cut out these regions (Fig. 7). We will explain how to calculate Wn(1n)k.
(1) We divide a subcell into six tetrahedra. (2) We cut out one or three tetrahedra T where θ ( F − nk) = 1 from tetrahedron T and evaluate nk, n k+q at the corners of T as

T i = Fij ( F − T 1, . . . , F − T 4) Tj ,

through linear interpolation (Appendix B). Here T 1, . . . , T 4
and T 1, . . . , T 4 are nk and n k+q , respectively, on the corners of T , where T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4.
(3) We cut out one or three tetrahedra T where θ ( n k+q − F) = 1 from tetrahedron T . The orbital energies are calcu-
lated as
