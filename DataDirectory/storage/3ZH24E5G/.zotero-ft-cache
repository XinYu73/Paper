Abstract

Li metal dendrite growth in LiPF 6 –propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte was observed in situ by a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) with a metallographic microscope. The development of the electrodeposited Li dendrite length was analyzed, and compared with dendrites grown in LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte solution. Different anions make different Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layers on the electrodeposited Li metal. This difference is one factor which causes the morphological variation and the different dendrite growth behavior of Li metal in these electrolytes. The relationship between the Li dendrite growth and Li + ionic mass transfer rate associated with the electrodeposition of Li metal is examined, and dendrite initiation and growth rate are discussed. The authors find that ionic mass transfer plays an important role in dendrite growth behavior.

1. Introduction

The establishment of a sustainable energy system is an imperative duty for humankind. Li secondary batteries are widely considered to be a good candidate for electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) power supply and also for electric storage devices in power systems. The established Li-ion batteries utilize graphite materials as the negative electrode. However, the theoretical capacity (372 mA h g −1 ) of current graphite electrodes is not sufficient for these future applications of Li secondary batteries. Li metal is a very attractive material due to the much higher energy density compared to graphite. In order to apply Li metal to the negative electrode of the batteries, it is necessary to control the morphology of electrodeposited Li metal. In particular, it is important to avoid any dendrite formation, which results in poor cycle characteristics and, in the worst case, the possibility of a safety problem because of short-circuiting phenomena. One reason why the dendrites form easily is non-uniformity of the surface film on Li metal. This surface layer is called the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) [1] . The SEI causes a nonuniform current distribution on the electrode surface during electrodeposition of Li metal corresponding to the charging operation. The SEI layer forms as a result of chemical reactions between Li metal and the electrolyte solution . Therefore, the SEI composition is dependent on Li salts and solvents in the electrolyte [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] . XPS measurement revealed that the chemical composition of the SEI layer changes with Li salts; the electrolyte solution containing LiPF 6 leads to LiF, and solution containing LiClO 4 yields LiOH, Li 2 O, Li 2 CO 3 and a small amount of LiCl. Furthermore, the solvents can react to form organic species, such as Li alkoxides and alkyl carbonate. Many investigations have been reported in the literature for the restriction of dendrite growth from the viewpoint of not only the electrochemistry , but also through the control of the SEI by means of additives [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] . According to those results, some additives can improve the flatness of the electrodeposited Li metal. Kanamura et al. showed that a small amount of HF improves the morphology of the electrodeposited Li metal by altering the composition of the SEI layer [9] , [10] , [11] .

To ensure long cycle lifetime of the Li metal electrode, it is necessary to suppress the dendrite formation in charging operations. Generally speaking, the dendrite growth has a close connection to the ionic mass transfer rate to the electrode surface in the electrochemical system. The depletion of the deposited species (mainly cation) induces dendrite-shape deposition. In case of Li electrodeposition, there are only a few reports which focused on the ionic mass transfer phenomenon [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] . In order to reveal the dendrite growth mechanism of Li metal, it is critical to understand the ionic mass transfer phenomenon, the morphological variation of the electrodeposited Li, and the surface state of the SEI layer. Our previous studies revealed the development of the concentration profile near the electrode surface during electrodeposition and electrochemical dissolution by using an in situ holographic interferometry technique [16] , [17] , [18] . Although the measurement of the electrode surface concentration was interrupted by the roughened Li metal dendrite, the development of the concentration boundary layer thickness was in good agreement with the theoretical calculation values.

In this study, in situ observation of the Li dendrite growth phenomenon in a LiPF 6 –propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte was conducted by using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) with metallurgical microscope [19] . The effects on the electrodeposited Li dendrite of the current density, concentration of Li + ion, and anion species are examined and discussed from the viewpoint of ionic mass transfer rate near the electrode surface.
2. Experimental

The cross-section of a Ni foil with 50  μm thickness (Nilaco Co.) was used as the working electrode for the electrodeposition of Li metal as mentioned in previous reports [19] . In previous research, it was found that a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) is very useful for in situ observation of dendrite growth, but the electrical flux lines were not uniform at the electrode surface because the working electrode surface was facing the objective lens of the microscope and the counter electrode was placed at the back of the working electrode. In this study, the cell configuration was revised, as shown in Fig. 1 . It is assumed that this configuration allows the Li dendrite to grow in a single direction towards the counter electrode during the initial stage of the electrodeposition. The counter electrode was a Li foil with 200  μm thickness (Honjo Metal Co., Ltd.), positioned parallel to and facing the Ni working electrode. The electrolyte solution was propylene carbonate (PC) containing LiPF 6 as Li salt (Kishida Chemical Co. Ltd.). The concentrations of the LiPF 6 salt were 0.25 mol dm −3 and 1.0 mol dm −3 . The initial content of water and HF as contamination were lower than 20  ppm. The cell body was an optical glass rectangular cell. The electrolytic cell was constructed in a glove box filled with purified Ar gas and sealed very tightly from atmosphere before being moved to the LSCM. Galvanostatic electrodeposition of Li was performed by using an automated electrochemical measurement system (HSV-100, Hokuto-Denko Co.).

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the electrodeposited Li metal surface morphology in LiClO 4 –PC(a) and LiPF 6 –PC(b), (c). The applied current density was 1.0 mA cm −2 , and the total amount of imposed electricity was 1.8 C cm −2 . Though the applied current density is small, the electrodeposited Li metal forms the typical whisker-like dendrites in LiClO 4 –PC solution. In LiPF 6 –PC solution, the electrodeposited Li metal forms hemispherical deposits at the center of the electrode. These morphological variations are in agreement with the reports by other researchers [20] . Using LiPF 6 as a salt in the electrolyte, it is expected to make same effect with small addition of HF because of the hydrolysis reaction as described below [21] ; LiPF 6 → LiF + PF 5 PF 5 + H 2 O → PF 3 O + 2 HF However, whisker-like dendrites were observed at the edge of the electrode even in LiPF 6 –PC solution because of edge effects. This suggests that the concentration of current density will cause the whisker-like dendrite growth even in LiPF 6 –PC solution.

Because SEM observation was done only ex situ , in situ LSCM observation was adopted in order to observe Li dendrite growth. In previous research, it was revealed that the morphology of dendrites, dendrite growth rate, and dendrite movement phenomena are affected by the Li + ionic mass transfer rate in correlation with the applied current density and bulk concentration in the LiClO 4 –PC solution system. Low current density promotes the localization of dendrite growth because there are fewer electrodeposition sites. Therefore, some large dendrites grow, although the applied current density is small. High current density promotes formation of whisker-like dendrites just after the electrodeposition starts, and high LiClO 4 concentration makes some whisker-like dendrites agglomerate to bush-like dendrites. In this study, we will discuss the effect of the ionic mass transfer phenomenon on dendrite growth in LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte and the effect of different Li salts (LiClO 4 and LiPF 6 ) on dendrite growth.
3.1. LiClO 4 –PC solution (previous research)

According to previous research, Li dendrites are formed before the Li + ion depletes at the electrode surface. The occurrence of Li dendrites is not strongly affected by the surface concentration, in contrast with the electrodeposition of other metals in aqueous solution system (e.g., Cu, Ag and so on). This behavior is typical of the electrodeposition of Li metal. However, once dendrite arms start to grow, the length grows proportionally to the square root of time. This linearity means that the Li + ionic mass transfer rate affects the growth of the Li dendrites. Furthermore, low concentration electrolyte solution enhanced the dendrite initiation and growth. Li + ionic concentration is an important parameter for Li dendrite growth, as is the state of the surface layer on the Li metal.
3.2. LiPF 6 –PC

Fig. 3 shows the time transient of the electrodeposited Li dendrite in 1.0 mol dm −3 LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte solution. The applied current density was 5.0 mA cm −2 . At 2 min after the start of electrodeposition, the localization of Li dendrite initiation is noticeable. In contrast to the whisker-shaped dendrite growth in LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte, the Li electrodeposited from LiPF 6 –PC solution forms hemispherical and agglomeration dendrites. The rotating and screwing movement of the dendrite arms was also observed during the dendrite growth, as is also the case in LiClO 4 –PC [19] , [22] . However, this movement is too small to distinguish in the static images.

In this study, because it is difficult to resolve single dendrites during the observations, the recorded images were divided into six parts evenly, and the dendrite length reported here is the length of the largest Li dendrite in each part. Fig. 4 shows the development of the dendrite length in each of the six partitions with respect to the imposed electricity in 1.0 mol dm −3 LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte. The primary dendrite arms grow with rounded shape and gradually get thick. Furthermore, late initiated Li dendrites were hardly observed. In the case of low current density (0.5 and 1.0 mA cm −2 ), shown in Fig. 4 a and b, the dendrite is relatively large in the initial stage of the dendrite growth. The number of dendrite initiation sites is less than that at higher current density (5.0 and 10.0 mA cm −2 ). The localization of current density distribution is more pronounced at low current density than under high current density conditions. In the low current density regime, the dendrite growth rate decreased after a certain amount of electricity was passed. This could be induced by the transition from a one-dimensional growth mode to a three-dimensional growth mode. This transition corresponds to an increase of the effective electrode surface area.

Fig. 4 . Dendrite growth with imposed electricity in 1.0 M LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte solution at various current density a: 0.5  mA cm −2 , b: 1.0 mA cm −2 , c: 5.0 mA cm −2 , and d: 10 mA cm −2 .

At 5.0 and 10.0 mA cm −2 , there are many dendrite initiation sites, and each dendrite competes to grow; the dendrite growth rate does not change drastically, as observed in Fig. 4 c and d. Imposing 5.0 mA cm −2 causes non-uniform Li dendrite growth, however, all of the electrode surface area seems to be electrochemically active for dendrite initiation at 10.0 mA cm −2 . The size distribution of the electrodeposited Li metal is relatively small in this observation time range. The theoretical growth rate is described under an assumption of uniform and compact electrodeposited film: (1) l ( μ m ) = i × M F × ρ × t ≈ 1.35 × i × t = 1.35 × q where l is the electrodeposited film thickness, i is the current density (A cm −2 ), t is the time for electrodeposition, M is the atomic weight, F is the Faraday constant, ρ is the density of Li and q is the electricity per unit area. From this equation, the theoretical growth rate of the electrodeposited film is 0.0135 μm s −1 at 10.0 mA cm −2 . The measured growth rate is constant at 10.0 mA cm −2 , but is several times larger than the theoretical value from (1) . Careful observation can also show some precursors of whisker-like dendrites at the tips of the electrodeposited Li metal as shown in the SEM images of Fig. 2 .

We focus on the ionic mass transfer phenomenon in the initial stage of the electrodeposition. The ionic mass transfer rate is assumed to be one-dimensional transient diffusion mode in the initial stage, as shown below: (2) c = c 0 - i ( 1 - t ∗ ) zF D 2 t π exp - x 2 4 Dt - x D erf x 4 Dt At the electrode surface ( x  = 0), (3) c s = c 0 - 2 i ( 1 - t ∗ ) zF π D t where c is concentration at distance x from the electrode surface, c 0 is bulk concentration, z is valence number, D is diffusion coefficient , t ∗ is transference number, and c s is electrode surface concentration. In this assumption, the electrode surface concentration varies linearly with the square root of time. In order to examine the relationship between the surface concentration and the initiation of the Li dendrite growth, the dendrite length is plotted against the square root of time, as shown in Fig. 5 . At each current condition, the development of dendrite length exhibits good linearity with the square root of time. This linearity means that the ionic mass transfer rate is one parameter for the dendrite growth of Li metal. Furthermore, by extrapolating this relationship to the horizontal axis, we can estimate the initiation time for each current density. The estimation was done only for some electrode partitions (see discussion of dendrite length measurements above), specifically those with the greatest dendrite growth rates. Fig. 6 shows the initiation time for Li dendrite growth against the applied current density. At 0.5 mA cm −2 , the initiation time is about 100 s after the electrodeposition starts. The initiation time drastically decreases with increased applied current density. From Eq. (3) , the surface concentration of Li + ion can be calculated. Table 1 shows the apparent Li + ion surface concentration at the initiation time of the dendrite growth for each current density. The initiation of Li dendrites does not require the depletion of Li + ions at the electrode surface in LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte, as is also the case in LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte [19] . This indicates that the surface concentration is not an important factor for the initiation of the dendrite growth. However, once the dendrite growth starts, it is controlled by the ionic mass transfer, indicated by the linear relationship between the dendrite growth and the square root of time, as shown in Fig. 5 . This estimation for the surface concentration is based on the assumption of uniform current density. Real current density is higher than that of the calculated value due to the non-uniform current density distribution, however, no fewer than 50 mA cm −2 is needed for the depletion of Li + ion during 100 s in 1.0 mol dm −3 LiPF 6 –PC solution. In previous research, the measurement of the surface concentration during electrodeposition was done by means of a holographic interferometer, and the surface concentration did not show such an extraordinary distribution, which would indicate the depletion of Li + at the initial stage of electrodeposition [18] .

Table 1 shows also the slope of the linear relationship between the dendrite length and the square root of time, shown in Fig. 5 . Three areas that showed intensive growth were chosen for making straight-line fits by the least-square method, and the averaged values of the slope for each current density are shown. Surprisingly, the largest value of slope occurs at 1.0 mA cm −2 . This will be affected by not only the applied current density, but also the number of electrodeposition sites. Generally speaking, high current density yields high over potential for the electrodeposition and a large number of nucleation sites. If the current density increases and the number of the electrodeposition sites also increases, the real current density does not change drastically. However, even if the number of electrodeposition sites does not change with an increase in current density, the real current density becomes larger. Such a relationship explains why the maximum value of slope occurs at 1.0 mA cm −2 in Fig. 5 . At low current densities (0.5 and 1.0 mA cm −2 ), the number of electrochemically active sites would be almost constant. In such a case, the current density is the more influential factor. In the high current density regime (above 1.0 mA cm −2 ), the number of the electrochemically active sites increases with the current density. As a result, the initiation time, shown in Fig. 6 , decreases with increase of applied current density.

Fig. 7 shows the Li dendrite growth in 0.25 mol dm −3 LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte solution. The applied current density is 5.0 mA cm −2 . Compared with the dendrites in 1.0 mol dm −3 solution, some Li dendrite grows very rapidly (represented by black circles). In such low bulk concentration solution, the relationship between the dendrite length and the square root of time also has good linearity, as shown in Fig. 7 c. The estimated initiation time for dendrite growth is about 11 s which is similar to that in 1.0 mol dm −3 electrolyte solution. However, the value of the slope is 3.3, which is much larger than 1.1 obtained in 1.0 mol dm −3 electrolyte solution. Focusing on the surface concentration, the concentration becomes about 0.17 mol dm −3 at the estimated initiation time and reaches 0 at about 120 s, according to the simple one dimensional diffusion model described by Eq. (3) . Furthermore, the dendrite growth is more ununiformly-distributed in 0.25 mol dm −3 electrolyte solution. Such a distribution will induce a steeper Li + ionic concentration gradient in the vicinity of Li dendrite growth and depletion of Li + ion. While Li + depletion at the electrode surface is not necessary for Li dendrite initiation, the depletion of Li + ion should promote growth.

3.3. Comparison LiPF 6 –PC system with LiClO 4 –PC system

Dendrites form without the depletion of Li + near the electrode surface in both electrolyte solutions. Hence, the initiation of Li dendrites is affected more by the surface chemical state than Li + ion concentration at the electrode surface. In LiPF 6 –PC solution, the frequency of the occurrence of the dendrites is smaller than that in LiClO 4 –PC system because of a difference of surface chemistry. Hemispherical dendrites are formed only initially and grow in LiPF 6 –PC, while whisker-like dendrites appear one after another in LiClO 4 –PC. The morphological variation of Li dendrites with respect to the concentration and current density is summarized in Fig. 8 . The difference in the SEI layer of the electrodeposited Li will induce morphological variation and differences in dendrite growth behavior. The LiPF 6 –PC system includes HF from the hydrolysis reaction of PF 6 - as mentioned above. The presence of HF preferentially forms LiF in the SEI layer on the Li metal surface, while the LiClO 4 –PC system has an SEI with Li 2 O, LiOH, Li 2 CO 3 as the primary constituents. The difference in SEI composition should affect nucleation of the electrodeposited Li metal and the morphological variation of the Li dendrite, as seen in Fig. 2 . Table 1 also gives the previous results for dendrite growth in LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte (shown in parentheses). The initiation time for dendrite growth in LiPF 6 –PC is larger than that in LiClO 4 –PC. This difference is also caused by the difference of SEI layer on the electrodeposited Li. The slope of the relationship between the dendrite length and the square root of time in LiPF 6 –PC is smaller than that in LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte. In the case of LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte solution, whisker-like dendrites form and often show the rotating and screwing movement. Furthermore, the dendrite growth starts one after another. In LiPF 6 –PC, on the other hand, electrodeposited Li metal forms hemispherical dendrites but the number of sites is fewer. Therefore, the slope of length vs square root of time is smaller.

Finally, the similarities of the dendrite growth in LiPF 6 and LiClO 4 –PC electrolyte solution are summarized below:

(1)

    The depletion of Li + ion near the electrode surface is not needed for the initiation of dendrite growth, but the surface state of the electrodeposited Li metal (SEI layer) is a very important parameter.
(2)

    Once dendrite growth starts, the dendrite length develops linearly with the square root of time. Dendrite growth is affected by the Li + ionic mass transfer rate to the electrode surface.

For further detailed discussion about these complicated Li metal dendrite behavior, we have to focus on one single dendrite growth phenomenon.
4. Conclusion

The Li metal dendrite growth phenomenon in LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte was observed in situ by using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Dendrite growth of electrodeposited Li was discussed in regard to the Li + ionic mass transfer rate associated with the electrodeposition , Li + bulk concentration, and the state of SEI layer depending on Li salt were focused.

Morphology was found to be strongly affected by the surface state of the SEI layer on the Li metal surface. Dendrite growth was found to be affected by not only SEI layer but also the Li + ionic mass transfer rate. Higher applied current density does not always promote larger dendrites because higher current density leads to an increase in the number of the electrodeposition sites. In other words, apparent current density may be significantly different from real current density value.

Low Li + ion concentration and localization of current density promotes dendrite growth, and the dendrite initiation time is smaller in LiClO 4 –PC than in LiPF 6 –PC electrolyte. The nature of the dendrite growth of Li metal is very complicated, and therefore, it is necessary to examine single dendrite growth behavior in the next study.
