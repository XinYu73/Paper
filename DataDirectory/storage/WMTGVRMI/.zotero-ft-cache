Abstract

We use first-principles density-functional theory to calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of TiF 3 using the full-potential-linearized augmented-plane-wave method. The local density approximation (LDA) predicts a fully saturated ferromagnetic metal and finds degenerate energy minima for high- and low-symmetry structures. The experimentally observed Jahn-Teller phase transition at T c = 370 K cannot be driven by the electron-phonon interaction alone, which is usually described accurately by the LDA. Electron correlations beyond the LDA are essential to lift the degeneracy of the singly occupied Ti t 2 g orbital. Although the on-site Coulomb correlations are important, the direction of the t 2 g -level splitting is determined by dipole-dipole interactions. The LDA+U functional predicts an aniferromagnetic insulator with an orbitally ordered ground state. The input parameters U = 8.1 eV and J = 0.9 eV for the Ti 3 d orbital were found by varying the total charge on the TiF 2 − 6 ion using the molecular NRLMOL code. We estimate the Heisenberg exchange constant for spin 1/2 on a cubic lattice to be approximately 24 K. The symmetry lowering energy in LDA+U is about 900 K per TiF 3 formula unit.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.
