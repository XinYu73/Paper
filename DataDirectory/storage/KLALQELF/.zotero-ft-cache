Abstract

Two mechanisms of melting are known, heterogeneous, where melting starts at surfaces, and homogeneous, where the liquid nucleates in the bulk crystal. If melting occurs homogeneously, a crystal can be superheated significantly above its melting temperature ( T m ) . At present, the physical meaning of the limit of superheating ( T LS ) is unknown. We demonstrate, by molecular dynamics simulations, that the total energy of a solid at T LS is equal to the total energy of its liquid at T m at the same volume. In the high pressure limit T LS and T m are connected by the constant k A B = ln 2 ∕ 3 via the relation k A B = T LS ∕ T m − 1 .

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

    The relation between the limit of superheating and the melting temperature of LJ solid at high (a) and low (b) pressures and embedded-atom model (EAM) of Cu (Ref. ) (c). The melting curve of a LJ fcc crystal (Ref. ) is shown by a solid line with open circles (a) and (b). The calculated isochores of the LJ are shown by solid curves with filled circles. Since the LJ melting curve was calculated in Ref. with a large step in , we performed two-phase simulations (Refs. , , ) to determine more precisely the at the pressures of 32.5 and . (The upper and lower bounds of are shown by inverted and right filled triangles, respectively; their numerical values at the are 2871 and and at the they are 5133 and ; after is reached the emerging, conditions are and and at higher pressure and .) One can see in (a) and (b) that the lower ends of the liquid parts of the isochores indeed correspond to the melting temperatures of the LJ solid. The same phenomenon holds for EAM Cu (c). After reaching the limit of superheating, the temperature of the system spontaneously drops to exactly (within the size of the symbols, which roughly represents the numerical error) the temperature of melting.
    The relation between and for Al (Ref. ) as a function of (open squares). The triangles represent the error bars for each point. The horizontal solid line indicates the numerical value of the constant [Eq. ()]. The inset illustrates the derivation of the constant [Eqs. (, , )].
