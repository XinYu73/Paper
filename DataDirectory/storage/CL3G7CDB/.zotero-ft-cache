We investigate the speed of disentanglement in the multiqubit systems under the local depolarizing channel, in which each qubit is independently coupled to the environment. We focus on the bipartition entanglement between one qubit and the remaining qubits constituting the system, which is measured by the negativity. For the two-qubit system, the speed for the pure state completely depends on its entanglement. The upper and lower bounds of the speed for arbitrary two-qubit states, and the necessary conditions for a state achieving them, are obtained. For the three-qubit system, we study the speed for pure states, whose entanglement properties can be completely described by ﬁve local-unitary-transformation invariants. An analytical expression of the relation between the speed and the invariants is derived. The speed is enhanced by the the three-tangle which is the entanglement among the three qubits, but reduced by the the two-qubit correlations outside of the concurrence. The decay of the negativity can be restrained by the other two negativity with the coequal sense. The unbalance between two qubits can reduce speed of disentanglement of the remaining qubit in the system, even can retrieve the entanglement partially. For the k-qubit systems in an arbitrary superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and W state, the speed depends almost entirely on the amount of the negativity when k increases to ﬁve or six. An alternative quantitative deﬁnition for the robustness of entanglement is presented based on the speed of disentanglement, with comparison to the widely studied robustness measured by the critical amount of noise parameter where the entanglement vanishes. In the limit of large number of particles, the alternative robustness of the Greenberger-H√orne-Zeilinger-type states is inversely proportional to k, and the one of the W states approaches 1/ k.

I. INTRODUCTION
Entanglement [1], which reveals essentially diﬀerence between quantum and classical mechanics, plays a vital role in many discussions on the fundamental issues of quantum mechanics. In recent years, it has been found as a resource of quantum communication and computation [2], such as quantum key distribution [3, 4], quantum teleportation [5] and quantum dense coding [6].
However, it’s impossible that a quantum system isolates from its environment completely, so the system unavoidably loses its coherence due to interactions with the environment. In composite systems, entanglement is an manifestation of quantum coherence, which will decay under the inﬂuence of decoherence. This dynamics of entanglement in the open systems has recently attracted the interest of many researchers [7–19]. It has been shown that in some cases entanglement can vanish in ﬁnite times. This phenomenon of sudden loss of entanglement is known as entanglement sudden death (ESD) [7–11, 20]. The experimental evidences of the interesting phenomenon have been reported for atomic ensembles [12] and optical setups [13, 14].
One of the topics in this direction is about the robustness of entanglement, in which the stability of an

entangled system is a major concern to the researchers. Recently, many investigations on the robustness, especially of the multiqubit quantum systems, have been reported. The concept for the robustness of entanglement has been introduced by Vidal and Tarrach [21] as a measure of entanglement corresponds to the minimal amount of mixing with separable states which washed out all entanglement. Then, in some articles [15–19], the robustness is deﬁned as the critical amount of decoherence, where the entanglement entanglement vanishes. In [15], the authors pointed out that, under depolarizing channels, the robustness of entanglement for multiqubit systems increased with the qubit number k. Aolita et al. [16] showed that the time, when the entanglement of a pure Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state system became arbitrarily small and useless as a resource, was inversely proportional to the particle number k, although its ESD time increased with k. In [17], Man et al. studied the entanglement robustness measured by the time when an entangled state became completely separable or remained entangled with a negligible entangled amount, and showed that entanglement robustness can be enhanced by local operation for the generalized kqubit GHZ-type states. Zhao and Deng [19] studied the multiqubit systems under local depolarizing channel, and found a residual eﬀect on the robustness of a three-qubit system in a superposition of GHZ state and W state.
Inspired by the results given by Zhao and Deng [19], the main purpose of this paper is to study the relation between the stability of an entangled system and its entanglement properties. However, the robustness, measured

2

by the critical noise parameters where the ESD occurs, is determined by the nature of the series of intermediate states from being entangled to separable under the process of decoherence. In addition, as shown in [16], the ESD time is irrelevant to assess the robustness of multiparticle entanglement in some channels. Therefore, we present the linear response of the entanglement under an inﬁnitesimal noise, namely the speed of disentanglement (SoDE), as a quantitative signature of the resistance of an entangled state. On the other hand, the behavior of the entanglement at the beginning of the decoherence process becomes very importance in the application for quantum information, since the coherence time of a qubit has been greatly prolonged in some recent schemes [22, 23]. It is not the ﬁrst time to concern about the time-derivative of the entanglement, for instance, the derivative of the tangle is studied in the investigation about the entanglement ﬂow in multipartite systems [24]. To exclude the properties of an entangled system aﬀecting the SoDE beside the entanglement, we adopt the model of a multiqubit system in which each qubit is coupled to its own depolarizing environment individually, the same as that in [15, 19]. The model is invariable under both the local unitary (LU) transformations and the permutations of the qubits. Furthermore, in the limit of large number of particles, the qualitative behavior of an entangled state is largely independent of the speciﬁc decoherence model [25].
As the ﬁrst trial, in the present paper, we only consider speed of the bipartition entanglement between one qubit and the remaining k − 1 qubits constituting the k-qubit system. We adopt the negativity N [26–28] to measure the entanglement, which is widely used in recent investigations of the entanglement dynamics in multiqubit system [15, 19, 29, 30]. Compared to other entanglement measurements, such as the concurrence C [31, 32], a distinct advantage of the negativity is its computability. Besides, for the arbitrary bipartite pure states, N > 0 is the necessary and suﬃcient condition for entanglement [32]. Most of the recent works about the robustness of entanglement in multiparticle system focus on the pure states case. It is certainly true that our deﬁnition of the SoDE is not restricted to the negativity. However, we ﬁnd the SoDE for concurrence are very close to the one for negativity, in some special cases where the concurrence or its bound can be calculated. The details are given in the conclusion and discussion section.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we make a brief review for the the decoherence model and the entanglement measurements, and give some general formulas for the SoDE. In Sec. III and IV, we study the SoDE for two-qubit arbitrary states and three-qubit pure states, respectively. In Sec. V, we give the result for several special states in multiqubit system, such as GHZ-type state, W-type state, etc. Conclusion and discussion are made in the last section.

II. DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL FORMULAS

A. Decoherence Model

Under local noise environments, without the interaction between the subsystems in the k-party system, the dynamics of each particle is governed by a master equation which depends on its own environment [29]. From the master equation, one can obtain a completely positive trace-preserving map εi which describes the evolution of the corresponding subsystem [29]: ρi(t) = εiρi(0), (i = 1, ..., k), and for the whole state ρ(t) = ⊗ki=1εiρ(0). In the Born-Markovian approximation, the channel can be described by its Kraus representation [19, 29, 33] as

M

εiρi(0) = Ejiρi(0)Ej†i

(1)

j=0

where Eji, j = 0, ..., M are the so-called Kraus operators needed to completely characterize the channel.
In detail, for the one-qubit quantum system, the Kraus operators of the partially depolarizing channel can be expressed as

E0 =

1 − p′I, Ej =

p′ 3

σj

,

(2)

where

I

is

the

unit

matrix,

p′

=

3p 4

with

p

being

the

depolarization parameter, and σj (j = 1, 2, 3) are the

corresponding Pauli matrices. In the Bloch sphere repre-

sentation for the qubit density operator, the map can be

written

as

ερ

=

1 2

(I

+ sr · σ),

where

s

=

1 − p.

Following

the Ref. [34], we consider the depolarization parameter

s = s(t) = e−κt, where κ is a decay constant determined

by the strength of the coupling to the environment and

t is the interaction time. Without loss of generality, we

set κ = 1 and s = e−t in the present work.

B. Entanglement measurements and invariants
Several concepts have been presented to quantify or describe the entanglement in quantum systems, such as the entanglement of formation [31], the entanglement cost [35], the distillable entanglement [36], the relative entropy of entanglement [37], and so on. Here, we brieﬂy review the concurrence [31] and negativity [26] for bipartition entanglement, and the entanglement invariants for three-qubit pure states, which are utilized in this paper.
The negativity as a measure of entanglement was introduced by Z˙ yczkowski et al. [28], base on positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion[27], which is necessary for separability, but suﬃcient only for 2 ⊗ 2 and 2 ⊗ 3 systems [38]. For a bipartite system described by the density ma-

3

trix ρ, the negativity is deﬁned as [27, 28]

N (ρ) = 2 |λj|,

(3)

j

where λj are the negative eigenvalues of ρT and T denotes the partial transpose operation on one of the subsystems. For a pure m ⊗ n (m ≤ n) state in the standard Schmidt form

|ψ = ai|µiνi

(4)

i

where ai ∈ [0, 1] (i = 1, ..., m) are the Schmidt coeﬃcients satisfying i a2i = 1, |µi and |νi are the orthonormal basis of the two subsystems, the negativity is given by [32]

2

N (|ψ ) =

ai − 1,

(5)

i

from which one can ﬁnd the fact that, N > 0 is the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the entanglement in pure states.
The concurrence originated in the investigation of the entanglement of formation [31]. The concurrence of a pure state |ψ in a bipartite system is given by [32]

C(|ψ ) = 2(1 − Trρ2A) = 2(1 − Trρ2B),

(6)

where ρA = TrB|ψ ψ| is the partial trace of |ψ ψ| over subsystem B, and ρB has a similar meaning. For a mixed state, the concurrence is deﬁned as the average concur-
rence of the pure states of the decomposition, minimized over all decompositions of ρ = j pj|ψj ψj |,

C(ρ) = min pjC(|ψj ).

(7)

j

For the two-qubit case, it is equivalent to the entanglement of formation [31] and can be expressed explicitly as

C(ρ) = max{0, λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4},

(8)

in which λ1, ..., λ4 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the operator R = ρ(σy ⊗ σy)ρ∗(σy ⊗ σy) in decreasing order and σy is the second Pauli matrix.
For an m ⊗ n (m ≤ n) arbitrary quantum state ρ, the negativity is proved to provide a lower bound of the concurrence as [32]

C(ρ) ≥

2 m(m −

1)

N

(ρ).

(9)

In the present work, we focus on the bipartite entanglement between the jth qubit and the remain k − 1 qubits constituting the k-qubit system. Under the two mea-

surements, it is denoted by Nj and Cj respectively. This corresponds to the case of m = 2 in (9), where the relation reduces to Cj(ρ) ≥ Nj(ρ). And for the k-qubit pure states Cj(|ψ ) = Nj(|ψ ), which can be obtained directly from their deﬁnitions in (5) and (6).
The entanglement invariants [39–41] of three-qubit pure states are ﬁve linear independent polynomials, which is invariance under LU transformations. For the three-qubit pure state ρ = |ψ ψ|, they are given by

,

I4 = 3Tr[(ρi ⊗ ρj)ρij ] − Trρ3i − Trρ3j ,

I5 = τ 2 = (Ni2 − Ci2j − Ci2k)2,

(10)

where ρi = Trjkρ (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3) are the one-particle density matrices, ρij = Trkρ are the two-particle density matrices, and Ni and Cij are the negativity and concurrence of the reduce states with the corresponding subscripts. The invariants I1,2,3 are equivalent to the one-qubit linear entropies, which characterize the entan-
glement between one qubit and the the remaining two
qubits. The last invariant I5 is equivalent to the threetangle τ , which describes the whole entanglement of the
three-qubit system [42, 43]. The remaining invariant I4 is related to the relative entropy of the two-qubit state
ρij relative to the product state ρi ⊗ ρj, and is a second measure of the entanglement of in the reduced states of
ρij, independent of the concurrence Cij which can be determined by N1,2,3 and τ [39].

C. SoDE and perturbation approach

Under the local noise channels, the SoDE we focus on in the present article is the one between the ith qubit and the other part of the whole system. Utilizing the entanglement measure negativity, it can be expressed as

ηi(ρ)

=

dNi(ρs) dt

,
t=0

(11)

where ρs = ⊗kj=1εjρ is the ﬁnal state with ρ being the initial one. To compare with the widely utilized deﬁnition of the robustness by the ESD noise parameter, we present an alternative deﬁnition of robustness of entanglement, which is

Rηi = 1 − Exp(−Ti∗),

(12)

where Ti∗

=

Ni ηi

is

a characteristic time

of the disentan-

glement.

We ﬁnd that the SoDE ηi can be derived with the perturbation theory [44]. We called the method as the perturbation approach. In quantum mechanics, the perturbation theory is applied to the systems whose Hamil-

tonian can be divided into

H = H0 + ǫW,

(13)

where ǫ is the smallness parameter, and H0 is the easily solvable unperturbed Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues and
eigenstates of H0 are given by

H0|φk = Ek(0)|φk .

(14)

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H can be expanded in powers of the perturbation parameter ǫ,

Ek = Ek(0) + ǫEk(1) + ǫ2Ek(2) + ...

(15)

For the state |φk without degeneracy, the ﬁrst approximation is given by

Ek(1) = φk|W |φk .

(16)

When the energy level Ek(0) is dk-fold degenerate, with the eigenstates |φjk , (j = 1, 2...dk), the corresponding eigenvalues of H in the ﬁrst approximation are

Ek,α = Ek(0) + ǫβk,α, α = 1, 2...dk,

(17)

where βk,α is the α-th eigenvalues of the dk × dk matrix Wk with the elements Wk,ij = φik|W |φjk . One can notice that, when dk = 1, βk,1 becomes the result for the
non-degenerate case in Eq. (16). And, the trace of Wk
satisﬁes

dk

TrWk =

βk,α =

α=1

j=1

(18)

Through the noise channel in an inﬁnitesimal time dt, the state of a system can be written as

ρs = ρ + σdt,

(19)

where ρ is the initial state, σ is an Hermitian operator with Trσ = 0. The negativity of the ﬁnal state is given by Ni(ρs) = Ni(ρ) − ηidt. Considering the partial transposed state ρTsi = ρTi + σTi dt as the Hamiltonian of a quantum system, and dt as the smallness parameter, we ﬁnd the SoDE ηi is determined by the ﬁrst-order response of the eigenvalues of ρTi under the perturbation σTi dt. Since the negativity is deﬁned as the sum of the nega-
tive eigenvalues of the partial transposed density matrix, only the eigenvectors of ρTi with the zero and the nega-
tive eigenvalues contribute to the speed ηi. Namely, the negativity of ρs is

Ni(ρs) = −2 λj,− − 2 λ(j1,−) dt − 2 λ(l,10),−dt,(20)

j

j

l

where λj,− are the negative eigenvalues of ρTi and λ(j1,−) are the ﬁrst-order response under the perturbation σTi dt,

4

and λ(l,10),− are the negative responses of the zero eigenvalue. Therefore, the speed can be divided into two parts as

ηi = ηi(−) − ηi(0),

(21)

where ηi(−) = 2 j λ(j1,−) and ηi(0) = −2 l λ(l,10),−. According to the relations in Eqs. (16), (17) and (18) the
ﬁrst term can be expressed as

ηi(−) = 2

ψk−|σTi |ψk− ,

k

(22)

where |ψk− , (k = 1, 2...d−) are the eigenvectors of ρTi with negative eigenvalues. And the second one corresponds to the eigenvectors |ψj0 (j = 1, 2...d0) with the zero eigenvalues is ηi(0) = l |λ(l,10)| − l λ(l,10), where λ(l,10) are the ﬁrst-order responses of the zero eigenvalues. It is
equivalent to

ηi(0) = σ0Ti − Trσ0Ti ,

(23)

where σ0Ti is the d0 ×d0 matrix with the elements σ0T,imn = ψm0 |σTi |ψn0 ,√and · stands for the trace norm deﬁned by G = Tr GG†.

III. TWO-QUBIT ARBITRARY STATES
First we explore the connection between the SoDE of a two-qubit quantum system and its entanglement properties. Since the entanglement is invariant under permutations of the two qubits, we omit the subscripts of the entanglement and the SoDE.

A. Pure states

The pure states of a two-qubit system are always equivalent to

|ψ(θ) = cos θ|00 + sin θ|11 , θ ∈ [0, π/4], (24)

under LU transformations, with the entanglement N [|ψ(θ) ] = C[|ψ(θ) ] = sin 2θ. The evolution of the negativity for the states under the local depolarizing channel can be calculated directly. But we are willing to give the the following steps to demonstrate the perturbation approach introduced in the above section. The partial transposed density matrix of the pure state (24) is given by

(28)

which is a linear function of the entanglement. It is interesting to notice η → 1 when N → 0, which indicates
the ESD occurs in the pure state of this model even with
a slight entanglement. In such a situation, the ESD time equals to the characteristic time TESD → T ∗ → N , and the robustness in (12) is given by Rη → N approaching the result given in [19].

For the arbitrary two-qubit states, since their entanglement can’t be completely described by one entanglement measure, it is very diﬃcult to derive an analytical expression for the relation between the SoDE and the entanglement properties. Therefore we explore the bounds of SoDE for a given value of negativity and the states achieve the bounds, which is called as the frontier states in this article.
Following the approach in [45, 46], we generate randomly a great number of two-qubit states and plot them in the η-N plane as shown in Fig. 1 (a). We fortunately ﬁnd the pure states are the frontier states with the maximum of SoDE. To derive the frontier states achieving the lower bound, we begin with the ansatz states [45, 46]

where x, y, a, b, γ ≥ 0 and x + y + a + b + γ = 1. The region of the ansatz states in the η-N plane is the same as the one of the arbitrary states. By trying to adjust the constrains imposed on the ansatz states without leaving

the lower bound, we ﬁnd the frontier states ρm on the lower bound when x = y = b = 0, namely

ρm = γ|ψ(π/4) ψ(π/4)| + (1 − γ)|01 01|, (30)

with the pure states |ψ(π/4) deﬁned in (24). To verify
the frontier state ρm, we randomly generate weighted random states, namely the mixtures of random states and ρm with random weights, and plot them in the η-N plane. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), the region of physically
acceptable states is encircled perfectly by the curve of the state ρm. The results of the two families of frontier states presented the lower and upper bounds of the SoDE in two-qubit system as

frontier states exactly is the ones in the comparison of the concurrence and negativity. Speciﬁcally, the pure states

which has the maximal SoDE achieves the minimal concurrence when the negativity is ﬁxed, and the states ρm with the minimum of SoDE has the maximum of concurrence for a given negativity. This results indicate that the concurrence reduces the attenuation of the negativity.
Then, a question arises: Is there a deﬁnite link between the extreme cases in the two topics? To explore the relations, we introduce four non-negative quantities as ξ1 = C − N , χ1 = 2N + 1 − η, ξ2 = N − N min and χ2 = η − ηmin, where ηmin is the lower bound of the SoDE in (31) and N min = C2 + (1 − C)2 + C − 1 is the minimal negativity for a ﬁxed concurrence satisﬁed by the frontier states ρm. Plotting the randomly generated states in the ξ1-χ1 and ξ2-χ2 planes as shown in Fig. 2, in the same approach for η-N , we obtain the frontier states in the two planes. They are the states ρm for the ﬁrst case, and
ρk = γ|ψ(π/4) ψ(π/4)| + a(|01 01| + |10 10|), (32)
with γ + 2a = 1, for the second, which are shown by the solid lines in Fig. 2. By straightforward calculations, one can ﬁnd that, ξ1(ρm) is a single-valued function of χ1(ρm), and equally true for ξ2(ρk) and χ2(ρk). Hence, the states ρm has the maximums of ξ1 for a given χ1. When χ1(ρm) = 0, it can be derived that ξ1(ρm) = 0.

Therefore, for arbitrary states, χ1 = 0 ⇒ ξ1 = 0. In other words, the concurrence reaching the minimum is a necessary condition for SoDE with the maximum. Similarly, one can ﬁnd that the concurrence reaching the maximum is a necessary condition for SoDE with the minimum. These demonstrates that there are other factors that aﬀect the SoDE in two-qubit system in addition to the concurrence and negativity.

C. Two-parameter states

To study the inﬂuence on the SoDE by the concurrence and other quantities related with entanglement, we consider three classes of two-parameter mixed states in the similar form as the ansatz states (29).
As an analytical example to show the relation between the SoDE and the concurrence, the ﬁrst two-parameter class of states we studied is

ρC = γ|ψ(π/4) ψ(π/4)| + a|01 01| + b|10 10|, (33)

with γ, a, b ∈ [0, 1] and γ + a + b = 1, which is the ansatz state with x = y = 0. When a = b, it returns to the states ρk in (32), whose concurrence and negativity have the same values. When ab = 0, it reduces the states with the maximal concurrence, such as ρm in (30). Its SoDE can be expressed in terms of N and C as

,

(34)

which can returns to the bounds in (31) in the two cases

of a = b and ab = 0 respectively. In the Fig. 3 (a),

one can notice in this family of states, when the other

entanglement measure is ﬁxed, the SoDE increases as the

negativity increases, but decrease with the concurrence

increasing.

Considering the frontier states ρm in (30) are precisely the maximally entangled mixed states in the region of

C ≥ 2/3 [45], we attempt to ﬁnd the relation between

the SoDE and the the degree of mixture, measured by

the linear entropy as SL(ρ) =

4 3

(1

−

Trρ2

).

Since, for a

given concurrence the pure states has the minimal linear

entropy, we choose the hybrid states of (24) and (30) as

ρSL = γ|ψ(θ) ψ(θ)| + (1 − γ)|01 01|.

(35)

In Fig. 3 (b), one can notice for a ﬁxed mixture in these states, the relation between the SoDE and negativity is approximately linearity. However, the SoDE does not clearly relate with the linear entropy SL.
Rather than the mixture of the whole state, we are interested in the quantities describing the relations between the subsystems. The total correlation in a bipartite quantum system has been deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the sum of the von Neumann entropies of the two subsystems and that of the whole system, called the

two-parameter states as

ρItot = ρansatz |y=0,C=f (N ),

(37)

where f (x) = −x/2 + x + 5x2/4. Here, actually, the choice of the function f (x) is quite arbitrary only requires f (x) ≥ x when x ∈ [0, 1]. With the above form of the function, the region of the states ρItot in (37) in the η-N plane is large enough, and the inﬂuence of the quantum mutual information can be shown clearly. In Fig. 3 (c), one can notice for a given N , of course the concurrence C is ﬁxed, the SoDE decreases with the Itot increasing. That is, the correlations other than the entanglement described by the concurrence also reduce the SoDE under a noise environment.

IV. THREE-QUBIT PURE STATES

In this section, we explore the SoDE of the three-qubit pure states, whose entanglement properties can be described by the invariants in (10). For a three-qubit system, there are two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, which are the GHZ state and the W state

|GHZ = √1 |000 + |111 , 2

|W = √1 |001 + |010 + |100 .

(38)

They can’t be transformed each other by stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) [48]. The GHZ state possesses a maximum tripartite entanglement characterized by the three-tangle [42], for which case τ (|GHZ ) = 1, but the residual bipartite entanglement of GHZ state is zero. However, the W state possesses zero three-tangle, with τ (|W ) = 0, and maximizes the residual bipartite entanglement.
In [19], the authors ﬁnd the most robust symmetrical three-qubit pure states under the partially depolarizing channel are the GHZ-like states [see below Eq. (40)], and ascribe the robustness to the three-tangle. Our question is whether the conclusion is established when we consider the SoDE as the signature for the stability of the entanglement. Furthermore, what role do the ﬁve entanglement invariants play in the SoDE respectively?

A. Symmetrical states
To answer the ﬁrst question, we start from the symmetrical pure states, which are invariable under the permutations of the three particles. In this part, the subscripts of the negativity and the SoDE are also omitted. Generally, an arbitrary symmetrical three-qubit entangled pure

the main result of the present subsection given in Eq. (48). We remark that the states |J are not equal to the W-like states in [19] under LU transformation.

For the state of |G , the partial transpose over the ﬁrst qubit is ρTG = a|000 000| + a(1 − a)(|011 100| + |100 011|) + (1 − a)|111 111|. The eigenstate with the negativ√e eigenvalue can be obtained as |φ−G = (|100 − |011 )/ 2, and the ones with zero eigenvalue are |001 , |010 , |101 and |110 . The corresponding matrix in (23) is positive semideﬁnite, which is written in the basis {|001 , |010 , |101 , |110 } as

Therefore, the eigenvectors with the zero eigenvalue do not have contribution to the SoDE, η(0)(|G ) = 0. Similarly, η(0)(|J ) = 0. Their SoDE are only determined by

|Φ = t1|000 + t2|W + t3|W ′ + t4|111 , (39)

are independent.

As the two-qubit arbitrary states case, we can determined the bounds of the SoDE in the present case. The region of the symmetrical three-qubit pure states in the η-N plane is shown by the randomly generated states in Fig. 4 (a). Following the approach in the case of the arbitrary two-qubit states, we obtain the two frontier states on the lower and upper bounds are the GHZ-type states and the W-type states respectively

However, it is very attractive to us that whether the robustness comes from the three-tangle. We can obtain the invariants in the two families of states as

N (|G ) = 2 (1 − a)a, τ (|G ) = 4(1 − a)a,
I4(|G ) = 1 − 3a + 3a2,

.

For a given value of negativity, they satisfy τ (|G ) ≥ τ (|J ) and I4(|G ) ≥ I4(|J ), in which the equalities hold when N = 0 or N = 1. This suggests that there exists another candidate, the fourth invariant I4, for the main factor aﬀecting the stability of the negativity.

To answer the above question, we consider the hybrid states of |G and |J , as

|Υ = c1|000 + c2|W + c3|111 ,

(44)

where cj (j = 1, 2, 3) are real and j c2j = 1. Its independent entanglement invariants (regardless of the nor-

directly. Substituting it and the eigenvector into (21),
we obtain the SoDE in terms of the coeﬃcients cj as η(c1, c2, c3). In this case, η(0) = 0 means the eigenvectors with the zero eigenvalue do not have contribution to the SoDE. Considering the relations τ = N 2 and I4 = 1 − 3N 2/4, satisﬁed by the GHZ-type states, we suppose the

(48)

Very fortunately, we ﬁnd the relation is also satisﬁed by the general symmetry states (39).

From the above relation between the SoDE and the entanglement invariants, one can clearly notices that, η decreases with the increase of I4, but increases as the three-tangle increasing. In other words, the entangle-
ment among the three qubits, quantiﬁed by the threetangle, can enhances the SoDE, but the two-qubit correlations described by I4 reduces the speed of negativity. Therefore, it is I4 but not the three-tangle τ making the GHZ-type states to be the most robust symmetric pure states. In the analysis of the Ref. [19], the states they
considered have no more than two independent parameters, which muddles up the inﬂuences of I4 and τ .

B. General states

The discovery of the analytic expression of the relation between the SoDE and the entanglement invariants in symmetrical states in (48) reveals the SoDE is an effective tool to explore the role of diﬀerent entanglement in the stability of multipartite entanglement. This motivates us to extend it to more general case, and study the inﬂuences of the other invariants on the SoDE.
The general form of three-qubit pure states is given by

|Ψ = c0|000 + c1|001 + c2|010 + c3|011 +c4|100 + c5|101 + c6|110 + c7|111 , (49)

where ci(i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7) are complex constants and i |ci|2 = 1. Without loss of generality, the analysis can
be restricted to the negativity between the ﬁrst qubit and the subsystem containing the other two qubits.
Following our schedule in the symmetrical states case, we ﬁrst derive the bounds of the SoDE for the arbitrary pure states. Plotting the randomly generated three-qubit pure states in the η1-N1 plane, we ﬁnd only the lower bound are diﬀerent with the one of the symmetrical states in the region of N1 > 1/2. And the altered lower bound corresponds to nothing but the result of the pure twoqubit state in (28). Thus, the frontier states on the lower bound of the SoDE for three-qubit pure states are the GHZ-type states when N1 ≤ 1/2, and the direct product states of an entangled state containing the ﬁrst qubit and a single partite state of the remaining qubit, such as |µ = |ψ(θ) |0 with the |ψ(θ) deﬁned in (24). Besides the symmetric pure states |J , we also ﬁnd the frontier states on the upper bound contain the family of states as

|Π = α|0 |ψ(θ0) + β|1 |ψ′(θ1) ,

(50)

where |α|2 + |β|2 = 1, |ψ′(θ) = (I ⊗ σx)|ψ(θ) and (θ0 − π/4)(θ1 − π/4) = 0.
To realize the ultimate aim of the SoDE for the arbi-
trary pure states, we consider the subclass of states of Ψ as

|Λ = c0|000 + c1|001 + c6|110 ,

(51)

where ci are restricted in the real numbers. It can be regarded a hybrid state of the two frontier states on the
lower bound of the SoDE, which becomes the GHZ-type state when c0 = 0 and returns to |µ with c1 = 0. Its ﬁve entanglement invariants can be derived as

There exist four eigenstates of the partial transposed density matrix of |Λ with the zero eigenvalue, which span the degenerate subspace {|111 , c1|100 − c0|101 , |011 , c1|000 − c0|001 }. And the matrix σ0T1 deﬁned in (23) in the subspace is given by

The criterion for the matrix σ0T1 having a negative eigenvalue is c41c26 − c40c26 < 0. From the relations in (52), we

ﬁnd it can be replaced by Θ = (I2 − I3)2 − τ 2/4 > 0,
which is veriﬁed as the universal criterion for nonzero η1(0) for arbitrary three-qubit pure states. By using the relations in (10), the criterion can be rewritten as |τ12 − τ13| − τ > 0, where τij = Ci2j are the two-tangle. The second part of the SoDE for |Λ can be written as

On the other hand, we calculate a class of states without the three-tangle as

where j |cj|2 = 1 with j = 0, 1, 2, 4. It can be considered as a generalization of the W-like states in [19] Similarly, for |Ω , following the perturbation approach and replacing cj by the invariants, we get the SoDE

By the numerical validation, the above uniﬁed form almost is fulﬁlled by most all the three-qubit pure states. Namely, we take ∆η = |η1 − ηm|, where ηm is the numerical solution by the ﬁnite diﬀerence method with ∆t = 10−9. We generate 200000 sets of data for the ∆η, which show that ∆η is less than 10−5 when N1 ≥ 10−5. When N1 < 10−5, since the emergence of the phenomenon of ESD, the ﬁnite diﬀerence method is no longer suitable.
From the form in (58), one can notice the conclusions about the inﬂuences of I4 and τ on the SoDE drawn from the symmetrical states also exist in the general case. The sum of the invariants I2 and I3 can enhance the SoDE. In the other words, the decay of the negativity between the ﬁrst qubit and the subsystem containing the other two qubits, can be restrained by the other two negativity with the coequal sense. The unbalance between the second

and the third qubits, shown by the diﬀerences (I2 − I3)2 and |τ12 − τ13|, can reduce the SoDE of the ﬁrst qubit. Especially when |τ12 − τ13| > τ , the vanishing negativity can be partially brought back, which reﬂected in nonzero η1(0).
V. MULTIQUBIT STATES
For the multiqubit system, in which the SoDE will be more complex, due to the absence of a uniform measure of entanglement, we only study some special symmetrical states.
The k-qubit GHZ-type states have been investigated widely as a family of exemplary states in the topic about the decay of entanglement in multiparty systems. It is

It is interesting to notice the SoDE given by (28) of the two-qubit GHZ-type states isn’t contained in the form of (60). Based on the results in (42), we present a possible explanation as, the slop in the SoDE (28) of the twoqubit state comes from its similarity with the GHZ-type states, but the intercept is related with its property of the W-type states, since they are the two diﬀerent generalizations of the two-qubit pure states to the three-qubit system. In the limit of large number of particles k → +∞, the robustness (61) and the corresponding characteristic time approach Rη → 1/k and T ∗ → 1/k, which conforms to the time at which such entanglement becomes arbitrarily small [16].

η increases with k for 2 ≤ k ≤ 4, but decreases with k

when k becomes large. By contrast, one can cho√ose the GHZ-type states (59)
with the negativity N = 2 k − 1/k, and derive the difference between the values of SoDE in (60) and (63). It is easy to ﬁnd the diﬀerence increases with increasing number of qubits, when k ≥ 4. This reveals, the aﬀection of the entanglement besides the negativity on the SoDE becomes more prominent as the number k increases. According to these results, the family of the states |Z(q, ϕ) k is not a good sample to explore the role of diﬀerent entanglement components in the stability of the entanglement in the systems with a large number of particles.
VI. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In the present study, we investigate the dynamical properties of entanglement of multiqubit systems under local partially depolarizing channels. In this model, each qubit is independent couples with its own environment. Our main concern is the bipartite entanglement between one qubit and its complementary subsystem, measured by negativity. The relations between the SoDE and the entanglement properties in an entangled state are explored.
In two-qubit system, for the pure states, we get the analytical expression of the SoDE, which is determined completely by the negativity. For the arbitrary states, using the form of the ansatz states, we gain the upper and lower bounds of the SoDE. The pure states has the maximal SoDE, and the mixture of mutually orthogonal a Bell state and a separable pure state as (30) achieves the minimum of SoDE. The minimum and the maximum of concurrence are shown to be the necessary conditions for the two bounds respectively. With the aid of some classes of two-parameter states, we ﬁnd the SoDE can be reduced by both the concurrence and the total correlation.
In three-qubit system, we derive the analytical expression of the SoDE in terms of the entanglement invariants for arbitrary pure states. The GHZ-type states are shown to be the most robust, which is consistent with the result in [19]. However, by the relation between the SoDE and the invariants, we ﬁnd the main reason for the robustness in the GHZ-type states is the two-qubit correlation described by the fourth invariant I4. On the contrary, the three-tangle among the whole system can enhance the speed of negativity under the local depolarizing channel. The decay of the negativity can be restrained by the other two negativity with the coequal sense. The unbalance between two qubits can reduce the SoDE of the remaining one in the three-qubit system. Especially when |τ12 − τ13| > τ , the vanishing negativity of the ﬁrst qubit can be partially brought back.
At last, we study k-qubit system with the aid of some families of exemplary states. For the k-qubit systems in an arbitrary superposition of GHZ state and W state, the inﬂuence of the entanglement outside the negativity becomes less noticeable when k increases to ﬁve or six.

In the limit of large number of particles, for the GHZtype states, the characteristic time and the corresponding robustness deﬁned in (12) base on the SoDE, is inversely proportional to k. This coincide with the result of the time at which such entanglement becomes arbitrarily small given in [16]. Under the same conditio√n, the robustness of the k-qubit W states approaches 1/ k. A similar behavior has been reported in [49], exhibited by the the negativity of the least balanced partitions, in the k-qubit system initial with the W states under the amplitudedamping channel. These results show the eﬀectiveness of the SoDE and the corresponding alternative robustness to quantize the stability of the entanglement in multipartite quantum systems.

Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the universality of our definitions and results, especially about the choices of the entanglement measures and the noise channels. The main reason for adopting the negativity as the entanglement measure in our present work about the SoDE is its computability, and fatherly its speed being also computable eﬀectively with the aid of perturbation theory. A computable quantity always has more advantages for physicists. Because of the necessity and suﬃciency of N > 0 for entanglement in pure states, the SoDE deﬁned in (11) and the related alternative robustness can be used to explore the stability of the entanglement in arbitrary dimensional multiparty pure states. In addition, although N > 0 only is the suﬃciency condition for entanglement in mixed states with the dimension larger than six, the speed of negativity can still be considered as a signature for stability of the entanglement in the states with a nonzero N . Meanwhile, the robustness related with the ESD noise parameter is suspect, because its practical computation is usually based on the PPT criterion.

In principle, on can choose any measures of entanglement and study the corresponding SoDE. We conjecture that, in the multiparty system with pure states, the qualitative conclusions for other entanglement measure are similar with the ones for negativity.

Taking the concurrence in (7) for instance, one can deﬁne its speed as the form in (11)

ηC

=

dC dt

.
t=0

(67)

From the relation in (9), it is directly to ﬁnd the speed of the concurrence for a pure state in multiqubit system satisﬁes

ηC ≤ ηN ,

(68)

where ηN denotes the corresponding SoDE in (11). Especially, for the two-qubit case,

ηC = 2C + 1 = ηN .

(69)

And, for the k-qubit GHZ-type states

kC

C 2

ηC

=

ηN ,

(70)

where the upper bound comes from (68), and the lower bound can be derived as following. After passage through the depolarizing channel, the ﬁnal state can be divided as

ρGs = [1 − δ(s)]ρe(s) + δ(s)ρd(s),

(71)

where ρe(s) is a state in the space of {|0 , |1 } ⊗ {|0 ⊗(k−1), |1 ⊗(k−1)}, ρd(s) is a separable diagonal state, and they together with the non-negative coeﬃcient δ(s) depend on the noise parameter s. By the convexity of concurrence,

C(ρGs ) ≤ [1 − δ(s)]C[ρe(s)]

(72)

which leads to the lower bound in (70). Moreover, based
on the bounds in (70), we can obtain the corresponding alternative robustness RCη = 1 − Exp(−C/ηC) → 1/k, when k → ∞, which is the same as the result for negativity. Then, the above results left a interesting question for us: Can we ﬁnd a explicitly expression for ηC of the multiqubit pure states?
However, for the mixed states, the speed of concurrence has a problem of singularity. For example, in the two-qubit system, the form of ansatz states (29) is held
under the local depolarizing channel. The speed of con-

currence can be obtained as ηC =

b a

∂a ∂t

+

a b

∂b ∂t

−

∂γ ∂t

,

which approaches inﬁnity when a > 0 and b → 0 (or

a → 0 and b > 0). This property also exists under other

local operations [50], which holds the form of the ansatz

states and drastically enforces full rank of the states when

a = 0 or b = 0. However the corresponding alternative

robustness RCη has a ﬁnite value.

In order to compare with the depolarizing channel, we

also calculate the SoDE of the GHZ-type states |G k under the local dephasing channel, which is described

by the Kraus operators as E0 = (1 + e−t)/2I and

E1 = (1 − e−t)/2σ3. The SoDE for both the concur-

rence and the negativity are

η = kC = kN ,

(73)

which also lead the alternative robustness Rη → 1/k, with k → ∞. This is in accord with the conclusion about
the limit of large number of particles in [25].
