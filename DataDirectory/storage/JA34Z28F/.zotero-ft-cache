We consider mixed states of two qubits and show under which global unitary operations their entanglement is maximized. This leads to a class of states that is a generalization of the Bell states. Three measures of entanglement are considered: entanglement of formation, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement. Surprisingly all states that maximize one measure also maximize the others. We give a complete characterization of these generalized Bell states and prove that these states for ﬁxed eigenvalues are all equivalent under local unitary transformations. Furthermore we characterize all nearly entangled states closest to the maximally mixed state and derive a lower bound on the volume of separable mixed states.

In this paper we investigate how much entanglement in a

mixed two-qubit system can be created by global unitary

transformations. The class of states for which no more en-

tanglement can be created by global unitary operations is

clearly a generalization of the class of Bell states to mixed

states, and gives strict bounds on how the degree of mixing

of a state limits its entanglement. This question is of consid-

erable interest as entanglement is the magic ingredient of

quantum information theory and experiments always deal

with mixed states. Recently, Ishizaka and Hiroshima ͓1͔ in-

dependently considered the same question. They proposed a

class of states and conjectured that the entanglement of for-

mation ͓2͔ and the negativity ͓3͔ of these states could not be

increased by any global unitary operation. Here we rigor-

ously prove their conjecture and furthermore prove that the

states they proposed are the only ones having the property of

maximal entanglement.

Closely related to the issue of generalized Bell states is

the question of characterizing the set of separable density

matrices ͓5͔, as the entangled states closest to the maximally

mixed state necessarily have to belong to the proposed class

of maximal entangled mixed states. We can thus give a com-

plete characterization of all nearly entangled states lying on

the boundary of the sphere of separable states surrounding

the maximally mixed state. As a by-product this gives an

alternative derivation of the well-known result of Zycz-

kowski et al. ͓3͔ that all states for which the inequality

Tr(

␳

)

р

1 3

holds are separable.

The original motivation of this paper was the following

question: given a single quantum-mechanical system consist-

ing

of

two

spin-

1 2

systems,

i.e.,

two

qubits,

in

a

given

state,

how can one maximize the entanglement of these qubits us-

ing only unitary operations? If not only unitary operations

but also measurements were allowed, it is clear that a Von

Neumann measurement in the Bell basis would immediately

yield a singlet. Here, however, we restrict ourselves to uni-

tary operations. Obviously, these unitary operations must be

global ones, that is, acting on the system as a whole, since

any reasonable measure of entanglement must be invariant

under local unitary operations, acting only on single qubits.

As measures of entanglement, the entanglement of formation

͑EOF͒ ͓2͔, the negativity ͓3͔, and the relative entropy of

entanglement ͓4͔ were chosen.

The entanglement of formation of mixed states is deﬁned

variationally as E f (␳)ϭmin͕␺i͖⌺ipiE(␺i) where ␳

Aϭ␳S␳*S,

͑3͒

Sϭ␴y ␴y .

͑4͒

H(x) is Shannon’s entropy function and ␴y is the Pauli matrix. It can be shown that f (C) is convex and monotonically
increasing. Using some elementary linear algebra it is furthermore easy to prove that the numbers ͕␴i͖ are equal to the
singular values ͓8͔ of the matrix ͱ␳TSͱ␳. Here we use the notation ͱ␳ϭ⌽⌳1/2 given ⌽⌳⌽†, the eigenvalue decompo-
sition of ␳. The concept of negativity of a state is closely related to
the well-known Peres condition for separability of a state ͓6͔. If a state is separable ͑disentangled͒, then the partial transpose of the state is again a valid state, i.e., it is positive. For 2ϫ2 systems, this condition is also sufﬁcient ͓7͔. It turns out that the partial transpose of a nonseparable state has one
negative eigenvalue. From this, a measure for entanglement follows: the negativity of a state ͓3͔ is equal to the trace norm of its partial transpose. We will adopt the deﬁnition of nega-
tivity as twice the absolute value of this negative eigenvalue:

EN͑ ␳ ͒ϭ2 max͑ 0,Ϫ␭4͒,

͑5͒

where ␭4 is the minimal eigenvalue of ␳TA. In the case of two qubits, this is equivalent to the trace norm of the partial
transpose up to an afﬁne mapping.

The relative entropy of entanglement was proposed by Vedral and Plenio ͓4͔ as a measure of entanglement motivated by the classical concept of Kullback-Leibler distance between probability distributions. This measure has very nice properties, such as being a good upper bound for the entanglement of distillation. It is variationally deﬁned as

ER͑␳ ͒ϭ min Tr͑␳ log ␳Ϫ␳ log ␴ ͒,

͑6͒

␴෈D

where D represents the convex set of all separable density operators.
We now state our main result. Theorem 1. Let the eigenvalue decomposition of ␳ be
␳ϭ⌽⌳⌽†,

where the eigenvalues ͕␭i͖ are sorted in nonascending order. The entanglement of formation is maximized if and only if a

global unitary transformation of the form

is applied to the system, where U1 and U2 are local unitary operations and D␾ is a unitary diagonal matrix. This same global unitary transformation is the unique transformation maximizing the negativity and the relative entropy of entanglement. The entanglement of formation and negativity of the new state ␳ЈϭU␳U† are then given by
E f͑ ␳Ј͒ϭ f „max͑ 0,␭1Ϫ␭3Ϫ2ͱ␭2␭4͒…,
EN͑ ␳Ј͒ϭmax„0,ͱ͑ ␭1Ϫ␭3͒2ϩ͑ ␭2Ϫ␭4͒2Ϫ␭2Ϫ␭4…,
respectively, while the expression for the relative entropy of entanglement is given by

The class of generalized Bell states is deﬁned as the states ␳Ј thus obtained. These states are the maximally entangled mixed states ͑MEMS’s͒.
We now present the complete proof of this theorem. The cases of entanglement of formation, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement will be treated independently. We start with the entanglement of formation.

As the function f (x) is monotonically increasing, maximizing the EOF is equivalent to maximizing the concurrence. The problem is now reduced to ﬁnding

with ͕␴i͖ the singular values of

Q ϭ ⌳ 1/2⌽ T U T S U ⌽ ⌳ 1/2.

͑8͒

Now, ⌽, U, and S are unitary, and so is any product of them. It then follows that

͑9͒

V෈U͑4͒

with ͕␴i͖ the singular values of ⌳1/2V⌳1/2. The inequality becomes an equality if there is a unitary matrix U such that the optimal V can be written as ⌽TUTSU⌽. A necessary

and sufﬁcient condition for this is that the optimal V be
symmetric (VϭVT): as S is symmetric and unitary, it can be written as a product S1TS1 , with S1 again unitary. This is known as the Takagi factorization of S ͓8͔. This factorization

is not unique: left-multiplying S1 by a complex orthogonal matrix O (OTOϭ1) also yields a valid Takagi factor. An

explicit form of S1 is given by

with O real orthogonal, indeed yields VϭV1TV1 . To proceed, we need two inequalities concerning singular
values of matrix products. Henceforth, singular values as
well as eigenvalues will be sorted in nonascending order.
The following inequality for singular values is well known ͓9͔.

The optimal unitary operations U are thus all of the form UϭS1†OV1D␾1/2⌽† with O an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. It has to be emphasized that the diagonal matrix D␾ will not have any effect on the state ␳ЈϭU⌽⌳⌽†U†.

This completes the proof of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 1. We now proceed to prove the second part of Theorem 1
concerning the negativity. This proof is based on the Rayleigh-Ritz variational characterization of the minimal eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix:

␭min͑ ␳TA͒ϭ min Tr ␳TA͉x͗͘x͉
x:ʈxʈϭ1

ϭ min Tr ␳͉͑x͗͘x͉͒TA.

͑19͒

x:ʈxʈϭ1

The eigenvalue decomposition of (͉x͗͘x͉)TA can best be de-
duced from its singular-value decomposition. Let ˜x denote a reshaping of the vector x to a 2ϫ2 matrix with ˜xijϭ͗ei   e j͉x͘. Introducing the permutation matrix P0ϭ⌺i jei j   e ji, the partial transpose can be written as follows:

͉͑x͗͘x͉͒TAϭ P0͑˜x  ˜x†͒.

͑20͒

The proof of this statement is elementary. We denote the Schmidt decomposition of the vector ͉x͘ by

˜x

ϭ

U

⌺

U

,

͑21͒

where the diagonal elements of ⌺ are given by ␴1 ,␴2 . Since x is normalized we can parameterize these as cos ͑␣͒ and sin
͑␣͒ with 0р␣р␲/4 ͑to maintain the ordering͒. We get

͉͑x͗͘x͉ ͒TAϭ P0͑ U1   U2͒͑ ⌺   ⌺ ͒͑ U2   U1͒†. ͑22͒

This clearly is a singular-value decomposition. The explicit
eigenvalue decomposition can now be calculated using the
basic property of P0 that P0(A   B)ϭ(B   A) P0 for arbitrary A,B. It is then easy to check that the eigenvalue decomposition of (͉x͗͘x͉)TA is given by

For the problem at hand, we have to minimize the minimal eigenvalue of (U␳U†)TA over all possible U෈U(4). Thus,
we have to minimize

where we have absorbed the eigenvector matrix ⌽ of ␳, as well as V(x)†, into U, yielding W. Now, the minimization
over W can be done by writing the trace in components

where d(␣) and ␭ denote the vectors containing the diagonal elements of D(␣) and ⌳, respectively. J(W) is a doubly

stochastic matrix formed from W by taking the modulus

squared of every element. The minimum over all W is at-

tained when J(W) is a permutation matrix; this follows from

Birkhoff’s theorem ͓8͔, which says that the set of doubly

stochastic matrices is the convex closure of the set of permu-

tation matrices, and also from the fact that our object function is linear. Since the components of ␴ and ␭ are sorted in descending order and ␭ is positive, the permutation matrix yielding the minimum for any ␣ is the matrix

ͩ ͪ0 0 0 1 0010 J0ϭ 0 1 0 0 .

͑27͒

Thus W has to be chosen equal to J0 multiplied by a diagonal

This immediately yields the conjectured formula for the optimal negativity.

We now have to ﬁnd the U for which this optimum is

reached. As V(x)†U⌽ϭW, it follows that the optimal uni-

tary transformation U is given by UϭV(x)J0D␾⌽†:

This is exactly the same U as in the case of entanglement of formation.
Next we move to the third part of Theorem 1 concerning the relative entropy of entanglement. We ﬁrst prove two lemmas.

MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED MIXED STATES OF TWO QUBITS

PHYSICAL REVIEW A 64 012316

T ͑ ␳ ͒ϭV diag͑ V†␳V ͒V†.
Here, diag(␳) is the superoperator that sets all off-diagonal elements of ␳ equal to zero while keeping the diagonal ones intact. This superoperator can also be written as
͚ diag͑␳ ͒ϭ Pi␳ Pi/2n, i
where Pi runs through all possible diagonal matrices having only ϩ1 or Ϫ1 on their diagonal ͓12͔. It follows that T is of the form mentioned in Lemma 1 and, furthermore, that it is a self-dual superoperator, i.e., T †ϭT.
It is obvious that all MEMS’s ͑with U1ϭU2ϭ1) are left invariant by T. We will now show that any such T maps separable states to separable states. Consider the pure product states only; if the proposition is valid for pure product states, it will be valid for all separable states ͑by linearity͒. The most general pure product state has the state vector ␺ ϭ(ac,ad,bc,bd), with a,b,c,d complex numbers. Then, since
V†␺ϭ„͑adϩbc ͒/&,bd,͑adϪbc ͒/&,ac…,
T ͑ ␺␺†͒ϭV diag͑ V†␺␺†V ͒V†ϭV⌳V†,
where the diagonal elements of ⌳ are, in order,
„͉͑ adϩbc ͒/&͉2,͉bd͉2,͉͑ adϪbc ͒/&͉2,͉ac͉2….
As these values are not necessarily sorted, T(␺␺†) need not be a MEMS. However, it is still possible to apply the formula for the negativity of MEMS’s which says that
EN͑ ␳ ͒ϭmax„0,ͱ͑ ␭1Ϫ␭3͒2ϩ͑ ␭2Ϫ␭4͒2Ϫ␭2Ϫ␭4….
As can be easily checked, the validity of this formula does not rely on the ordering of the ␭i , as long as each ␭i pertains to the ith column of V. In particular, using
␭1Ϫ␭3ϭ2 Re͓ab͑ cd ͒*͔,
␭2Ϯ␭4ϭ͉bd͉2Ϯ͉ac͉2,
we get for the negativity of T(␺␺†)

Hence, T(␺␺†) is separable, as we set out to prove, so that T maps separable states to separable states.
From the previous discussion it also follows that states of the form V⌳V† are separable if and only if the eigenvalues satisfy

ͱ͑ ␭1Ϫ␭3͒2ϩ͑ ␭2Ϫ␭4͒2Ϫ␭2Ϫ␭4р0.

͑29͒

Furthermore, states V⌳V† are obviously invariant under T. Hence, letting ␴ traverse all separable states of this form generates the same set of states T͑␴͒ as letting ␴ traverse all separable states without restriction. Therefore,

that the inequality must be an equality.
Actually, an even stronger result holds, as we can restrict ourselves in this minimization to states ␴ϭV⌳V†෈D where the diagonal elements appear in descending order (␭1у␭2 у␭3у␭4). In other words, ␴ may be taken from the set of separable MEMS’s. To see this, note that, as ␳ and ␴ are
both MEMS’s,

͚ S͑␳ʈ␴ ͒ϭ pi͑log piϪlog ␭i͒, i
where the pi are the sorted eigenvalues of ␳, and ␭i are the not necessarily sorted eigenvalues of ␴. It is easy to see that one always gets a lower relative entropy by permuting the ␭i into descending order ͓12͔. This ends the proof of Lemma 4.
It is now easy to prove the last part of Theorem 1: Because the ␴ are restricted to separable MEMS’s, this means that, for any global unitary U,U␴U† is still separable. Hence,
ER͑ ␳ ͒ϭ min S͑ ␳ʈ␴ ͒
␴ ෈ D പ MEMS
ϭ min S͑ U␳U†ʈU␴U†͒
␴ ෈ D പ MEMS
у min S͑ U␳U†ʈU␴U†͒
U␴U†෈D
ϭER͑U␳U†͒,
where the inequality arises because the minimization domain has been enlarged.
The explicit calculation of the relative entropy of entanglement of the maximally entangled mixed states is now a tedious but straightforward exercise, whose result is quoted in the theorem. This completes the proof of Theorem 1. ᮀ
Let us now analyze more closely this class of generalized Bell states. We already know that U is unique up to local unitary transformations. It is easy to check that the ordered

eigenvalues of the generalized Bell states for given entangle-

For a given EOF there is thus, up to local unitary transfor-

mations, a two-dimensional manifold of maximally en-

tangled states. In the case of concurrence Cϭ1 the upper and

the lower bounds on ␤ become equal and the unique pure

Bell states arise. Another observation is the fact that ␭4 of all

generalized Bell states is smaller then 61. This implies that, if

the

state is separable.

A natural question is now how to characterize the en-

tangled states closest to the maximally mixed state. A sen-

sible metric is given by the Frobenius norm ʈ␳Ϫ1ʈ2

ized Bell states at the boundary of entangled states where

both the concurrence and the negativity become zero. This

can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. A

straightforward calculation leads to a one-parameter family

The Frobenius norm ʈ␳Ϫ1ʈ2 for all these states on the

boundary of the sphere of separable states is given by the

exactly

equivalent

to

the

well-

known criterion of Zyczkowski et al. ͓3͔:

Here,

however, we have the additional beneﬁt of knowing exactly

all the entangled states on this boundary as these are the

generalized Bell states with eigenvalues given by Eq. ͑31͒.

Furthermore, Zyczkowski et al. ͓3͔ proposed a lower bound

on the volume of separable states by considering the ball of

states that remain separable under all global unitary transfor-

mations. Clearly,

the

criterion

⌺ i ␭ i2 р

can be strengthened

to ␭1Ϫ␭3Ϫ2ͱ␭2␭4р0. Some tedious integration then leads

to a better lower bound for the volume of separable states

relative to the volume of all states: 0.3270 ͑as opposed to

0.3023 of ͓3͔͒.

Further interesting properties of the maximally entangled

mixed states include the fact that the states with maximal

entropy for given entanglement all belong to this class. This

will be reported elsewhere.

In conclusion, we have generalized the concept of pure

Bell states to mixed states of two qubits. We have proved

that the entanglement of formation, the negativity, and the

relative entropy of entanglement of these generalized Bell

states cannot be increased by applying any global unitary

transformation. Whether their entanglement of distillation is

also maximal is an interesting open problem.
