ENERGY LANDSCAPES
The study of energy landscapes holds the key to resolving some of the most important contemporary problems in chemical physics. Many groups are now attempting to understand the properties of clusters, glasses and proteins in terms of the underlying potential energy surface. The aim of this book is to deﬁne and unify the ﬁeld of energy landscapes in a reasonably self-contained exposition. This is the ﬁrst book to cover this active ﬁeld. The book begins with an overview of each area in an attempt to make the subject matter accessible to workers in diﬀerent disciplines. The basic theoretical groundwork for describing and exploring energy landscapes is then introduced, followed by applications to clusters, biomolecules and glasses in the ﬁnal three chapters. Beautifully illustrated in full colour throughout, the book is aimed at graduate students and workers in the ﬁeld.

Cambridge Molecular Science
As we enter the twenty-ﬁrst century, chemistry has positioned itself as the central science. Its subject matter, atoms and the bonds between them, is now central to many of the life sciences on the one hand, as biological chemistry brings the subject to the atomic level, and to condensed matter and molecular physics on the other. Developments in quantum chemistry and in statistical mechanics have also created a fruitful overlap with mathematics and theoretical physics. Consequently, boundaries between chemistry and the other traditional sciences are fading and the term Molecular Science now describes this vibrant area of research.
Molecular science has made giant strides in recent years. Bolstered both by instrumental and theoretical developments, it covers the temporal scale down to femtoseconds, a time scale suﬃcient to deﬁne atomic dynamics with precision, and the spatial scale down to a small fraction of an Angstrom. This has led to a very sophisticated level of understanding of the properties of small molecule systems, but there has also been a remarkable series of developments in more complex systems. These include: protein engineering; surfaces and interfaces; polymers; colloids; and biophysical chemistry. This new series will provide a vehicle for the publication of advanced textbooks and monographs introducing and reviewing these exciting developments.

Preface

The motivation for writing this book was to produce a uniﬁed and reasonably self-contained account of how potential energy and free energy surfaces are used to study clusters, biomolecules, glasses and supercooled liquids. Making connections between these diﬀerent ﬁelds, where the same ideas frequently resurface in diﬀerent guises, will hopefully assist future research and interdisciplinary communication.
While this is essentially a theoretical book, I have tried to provide sufﬁcient background information and references to experiments to put the objectives in a proper context. Readers are assumed to be familiar with the basic ideas of quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and point group symmetry. Most other derivations are treated in suﬃcient detail to make them accessible to nonspecialists, graduate students and advanced undergraduates. A number of more peripheral topics are covered at an introductory level to provide pointers to further reading.
Some of this material has formed the basis of lecture courses on the subject of energy landscapes delivered to students at Cambridge and Harvard Universities, and at Les Houches Summer Schools, although it has all been rewritten in the current endeavour. I am particularly grateful to all the people who read initial drafts, and helped me to prepare ﬁgures.
No molecules were harmed in the writing of this book, although a number underwent signiﬁcant rearrangements.

1 Introduction

The structure and dynamics of atomic and molecular clusters, the folding of proteins (1, 2), and the complicated phenomenology of glasses are all manifestations of the underlying potential energy surface (PES) (3). In each of these ﬁelds related ideas have emerged to explain and predict chemical and physical properties in terms of the PES. In studies of clusters and glasses the PES itself is often investigated directly, whereas for proteins and other biomolecules it is also common to deﬁne free energy surfaces, which are expressed in terms of a small number of order parameters. Here, typical order parameters include the number of hydrogen-bonds in the ‘native’ (folded) state, and structural quantities such as the radius of gyration.
The term ‘energy landscape’ was probably ﬁrst introduced in the context of free energy surfaces (4–13). In particular, the surfaces obtained from models based on spin glass theory are discussed further in Sections 9.3 and 9.4. This approach is one aspect of ‘energy landscape theory’, but in this book a broader view is intended, which extends from the geometrical properties of potential energy surfaces to how these features determine the observed structural, dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Characterisation of a free energy surface often represents an important intermediate step in this analysis. The energy landscapes considered in subsequent chapters therefore include both potential energy and free energy surfaces. The calculation of thermodynamic and dynamic properties directly from these surfaces is a key aspect of this book.
The PES represents the potential energy of a given system as a function of all the relevant atomic or molecular coordinates. In general the PES is a highdimensional function compared to a free energy surface, which is obtained from the PES by averaging over all the other degrees of freedom for ﬁxed values of the order parameters. This averaging is repeated to provide an interpolation over the range for which the order parameters have physically

Introduction

interesting values. The PES is perhaps a more fundamental object, since there is no requirement for a subjective choice of order parameters. Free energy surfaces are also temperature dependent, whereas the PES is not.
A minimum on either a free or potential energy surface is a point from which a small displacement in any direction increases the energy. Just as for a basin surrounded by mountains on all sides, any step is uphill. For potential and free energy surfaces, the displacements correspond to changes in atomic coordinates and order parameters, respectively. The PES of even an apparently simple system may support very large numbers of local minima, and the lowest one is known as the global minimum. Whilst equilibrium thermodynamic properties only depend upon the relative potential energies of the local minima on the PES, and the volumes of conﬁguration space associated with them, the dynamical behaviour depends upon how these minima are connected. Understanding how some systems can relax eﬃciently to particular structures, such as a crystal or the native state of a protein, while others readily form glasses, requires a global view of the landscape. Even knowledge of the distribution of barrier heights that separate the local minima is not generally suﬃcient to understand the global dynamics, unless we also know which minima the barriers actually separate. In terms of free energy landscapes, local minima represent likely kinetic traps associated with ‘frustration’ (Section 9.4), which reﬂects competing and mutually exclusive interactions.
Characterisation of pathways between minima deﬁnes the connectivity of the PES, which is critical in determining relaxation dynamics. It is not enough simply to characterise a large sample of minima or investigate the eﬀects of a particular barrier height distribution.
Examples of potential and free energy surfaces are compared in Fig. 1.1 (13). For a collinear hydrogen exchange reaction, HA + HB − HC → HA − HB + HC, the potential energy surface is a function of just two internal coordinates, namely the two internuclear distances RAB and RBC (14, 15). However, the potential energy of a lysozyme molecule depends upon hundreds of internal coordinates, as well as the geometries of solvent molecules. In this case the schematic free energy surface in Fig. 1.1 is a function of two order parameters, Q and P , and was constructed simply to illustrate experimental observations for this system (13). The presence of distinct folding intermediates implies that there are other local free energy minima aside from the native and unfolded states. Furthermore, some lysozyme molecules refold quickly and others more slowly, suggesting that there is more than one distinct folding pathway on the surface (13). The pathways superimposed on the lysozyme free energy surface correspond to averages over ensembles of

Fig. 1.1. Comparison of potential and free energy surfaces, adapted with permission from reference (13). The potential energy, V , is an explicit function of just two internal coordinates for the linear hydrogen atom exchange reaction (top), namely the internuclear distances RAB and RBC (in ˚A). A trajectory that runs close to the valley bottom is marked in red. In contrast, the schematic free energy surface for lysozyme (bottom) has been constructed to match experimental observations by averaging over all the solvent and protein coordinates except for Q and P . G is the free energy, Q is the fraction of native contacts present, and P represents some measure of compactness (13). Three folding pathways are superimposed on the surface: the yellow trajectory represents fast folding, the green represents a slower path involving a higher free energy barrier, and for the red pathway the system ﬁrst explores a partly folded state before escaping to the route for fast folding.

Introduction

trajectories, whereas the path indicated for the hydrogen exchange reaction is a single dynamical trajectory.
Levinthal (16) ﬁrst pointed out in 1969 that the reversible refolding observed for some globular proteins (17) should be viewed as a remarkable achievement (Section 1.3.3), since the observed folding times were entirely incompatible with a random search of all the local minima on the PES. In the same year, the key role of the potential energy surface in determining the structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of glasses was recognised by Goldstein (18). Studies of homogeneous nucleation based upon the thermodynamic properties of clusters also began around this time (Section 7.1), and models were derived that accounted explicitly for the presence of diﬀerent local minima on the PES. Further progress was achieved by Stillinger and Weber, who addressed both the dynamics and thermodynamics observed in simulations in terms of local minima and the transitions between them (19, 20) (Section 7.1).
The potential energy, V , for a system containing N atoms in three dimensions, is a function of 3N spatial coordinates, which may be written as the components of a 3N -dimensional vector, X. The PES, V (X), is therefore a 3N -dimensional object embedded in a (3N + 1)-dimensional space, where the extra dimension corresponds to the value of the potential energy function.
Our ability to focus upon V (X), neglecting other degrees of freedom such as electronic coordinates, hinges upon the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (21), which is discussed in Chapter 2. Other quantum mechanical eﬀects, such as tunnelling (Section 4.5), will also be covered where appropriate, including the changes that result from utilising quantum mechanical partition functions in calculating thermodynamic and dynamic properties from the PES.
It is not diﬃcult to see how the PES determines the structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of any given system. The local minima of V (X) correspond to mechanically stable conﬁgurations, where the gradient of V vanishes, ∇V = 0, and hence so do all the forces. Elsewhere, the non-vanishing forces determine all the classical dynamical properties, while the thermodynamic properties depend upon V via ensemble averages. Even systems composed of hard spheres or discs have a potential energy surface, albeit an unusual one, since the potential energy is either zero or inﬁnity (22).
The theoretical advances that have occurred since some of the initial work mentioned above, coupled to the development of much faster and cheaper computers, now enable relatively complex problems to be addressed at the level of the underlying PES. Various aspects of this approach are described

in the following chapters. The remainder of the present chapter consists of material that is needed to make some of the discussions that follow accessible to readers from diﬀerent backgrounds, and provide an awareness of what has been achieved experimentally. Although the study of energy landscapes has evolved somewhat independently for clusters, proteins and glasses, the underlying principles are the same. Some of the introductory topics that are covered below are therefore provided in an eﬀort to make these connections as universally recognisable as possible.

1.1 Calculation of potential energy surfaces
This book is not intended to cover the calculation of potential energy surfaces. Nevertheless a few comments are probably in order, if only to provide pointers to alternative sources of information. As indicated above, the very notion of a potential energy surface depends upon separation of other degrees of freedom, such as those of the electrons, from the nuclear coordinates (Section 2.2). Ab initio or ﬁrst principles calculations generally include the electronic structure, although sometimes the nomenclature is used rather loosely. Most of these methods involve the approximate solution of a quantum mechanical Schro¨dinger equation, and many diﬀerent approaches have been suggested (23–26), which will not be reviewed here. In practice the sophistication of such models ranges from simple Hu¨ckel and extended Hu¨ckel theory (27), through semi-empirical approaches with acronyms such as PPP, CNDO, PNDO, INDO, MINDO, NDDO, PM3 and AM1 (28–31), Hartree–Fock self-consistent ﬁeld theory, perturbational approaches to electron correlation such as Møller–Plesset theory (32), various implementations of density functional theory (33), up to quantum Monte Carlo methods that include accurate treatments of electron correlation (34).
To produce a surface as a function of the nuclear coordinates using ab initio methods it is necessary to repeat the electronic structure calculations over a grid in conﬁguration space. Fitting or interpolating between these grid points to produce a continuous surface is an important area of research in its own right. Alternatively, the potential energy surface may be calculated quantum mechanically ‘on-the-ﬂy’, in other words, as it is needed (35). This approach forms the basis of ‘ab initio’ dynamics, and requires a particularly eﬃcient solution of the electronic structure problem, preferably one that scales linearly with the number of atoms in the system, i.e. O(N ) (36, 37).
Although quantum mechanical calculations are now possible for systems containing hundreds and even thousands of atoms, they are still prohibitively expensive, in terms of computer time, for many purposes. Alternative, and

Introduction

often less accurate, approaches are therefore commonly used, especially for large systems. Such methods employ interatomic or intermolecular potentials that are functions only of the nuclear coordinates, and are generally based on data obtained from experiments or ab initio calculations (38–47). A potential such as this is commonly known as a ‘force ﬁeld’, which reﬂects the early utilisation of force constants obtained from spectroscopy in such work.
A general force ﬁeld can be written as a series of terms representing the interactions between increasingly large sets of atoms, starting from two-body and three-body terms (23, 48):

surfaces corresponding to diﬀerent electronic states become close in energy

a proper treatment actually requires a matrix representation (Section 2.4),

where each element of the matrix is written in the above form.

In a valence force ﬁeld V (X) is written as a function of bond lengths,

bond angles and dihedral angles (or torsions), which are deﬁned in Fig. 1.2;

this representation implicitly includes some three- and four-body terms. The

bond length and bond angle terms are often quadratic functions such as

kr(r − re)2 and kθ(θ − θe)2, where re and θe represent equilibrium values and the k’s are force constants. When interactions are included between

atoms that are not covalently bonded the potential is known as a Urey–

Bradley force ﬁeld, and these terms are usually also represented by a simple

harmonic form involving the distance between atoms sharing a common

covalently bonded neighbour. Dihedral angles are deﬁned by two planes, as shown in Fig. 1.2, and usually involve four atoms in sequence. The corresponding energy terms typically include either a harmonic expression for improper dihedrals, kφ(φ−φe)2, or a short expansion, n kφ,n[1 + cos(nφ + δ)]. Improper dihedral angles are the ones used to maintain planarity or chirality.
A general expansion would include terms that couple together diﬀerent internal coordinates, such as rAB × rBC, and the corresponding force constants are termed oﬀ-diagonal . It may be important to include such terms if the potentials are to be used for systems that they were not ﬁtted to (49), and without this element of transferability valence force ﬁelds would be of little use. Systems that can be reasonably described in terms of pairwise interactions, or with only small contributions from many-body terms involving more than two atoms, are usually the easiest to treat in calculations. The anisotropy introduced by the many-body interactions in systems with strongly directional interatomic forces generally makes V (X) more time-consuming to evaluate, and has important implications for geometry optimisation strategies (Section 6.4).
Nonbonded interactions beyond a bare valence force ﬁeld typically include electrostatic terms, such as contributions corresponding to point charges, dipole moments or higher order multipoles, as well as terms designed to model quantum mechanical eﬀects, such as dispersion. Detailed analysis of these eﬀects belongs to the ﬁeld of intermolecular forces (50,51). Some force ﬁelds also include speciﬁc functions designed to model hydrogen bonds, while others treat certain molecular fragments as rigid, or combine a number of centres into united atoms (52, 53).
One of the ﬁrst empirical potentials designed to cover a variety of molecules was probably the molecular mechanics (MM) force ﬁeld of Allinger (38, 54), which was followed by reﬁnements such as MM2, MM+, and MM3 (38, 55–58). Other popular models currently in use include AMBER (59) (Section 9.7), CFF (60), CHARMM (40,61), Discover (62), ECEPP (63–65), ENCAD (66, 67), GROMOS (68), OPLS (43), Spartan (69), TINKER (70), UNRES (71, 72), and X-PLOR (73).
Mixed quantum–classical methods have also been developed, with the aim of treating certain parts of a large system using a relatively accurate quantum mechanical approach, without wasting computer time on less important regions, which are treated at a lower level of theory. The most commonly used is probably the QM/MM approach (74–82), although there are many other techniques such as EVB (83–86), MC-MDQT (87, 88), DME (89, 90), EFP (91, 92), and ONIOM (93, 94).

Introduction

1.2 Clusters
The term ‘cluster’ has been used for a very wide variety of diﬀerent systems, whose only common feature is probably their ﬁnite size. Clusters can generally be described as aggregates of atoms and molecules, but there is no particularly useful distinction between a large molecule and an atomic cluster. Examples such as buckminsterfullerene and the numerous covalently bonded boranes, carboranes, metalloboranes and ligated metal clusters of inorganic chemistry can equally well be described as molecules or clusters. This section will therefore provide a brief overview of various systems that have been termed clusters, with reference to the structural motifs observed, some of the experiments involved, and theoretical approaches. Particular examples are considered in more detail in Chapter 8.
For the purposes of the present book, it is the inﬂuence and accessibility of a number of local minima that is of most interest. Such eﬀects are not usually of primary concern in inorganic chemistry, perhaps because the energy diﬀerences and barriers to interconversion from the most stable isomer are accentuated by ligation of the surface atoms. In fact, rearrangements of ligated clusters have been studied, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, for example, and ﬂuxionality of boranes, carboranes and transition metal and organometallic clusters has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically (95–97).
Since it is possible to form clusters of atoms and molecules from elements belonging to almost any part of the periodic table, the scope of this ﬁeld is enormous (98–107). The following sections simply provide some indication of the possibilities available. The continued interest in such systems is partly due to their intermediate position between single atoms or small molecules and bulk material, as well as the unique properties that characterise the ﬁnite size regime (108). Of course, these properties must ultimately change to bulk values. The question of how large the system needs to be for this limit to be reached, perhaps ﬁrst posed by Lord Kelvin (109), depends sensitively upon which property is considered and the composition of the system. The high proportion of surface atoms in clusters that contain even thousands of atoms means that there are some common areas of research between clusters and surface science. Some of these areas, such as the catalytic activity of supported clusters, are clearly of commercial interest, and the emerging ﬁeld of ‘nanotechnology’ seeks to embrace these potentially useful properties. However, clusters also provide a convenient testing ground for many theories in chemical physics, and have been used in this way in a large number of studies.

The convergence of cluster properties to a bulk limit can sometimes be approximated quite well by correction terms that scale as 1/N 1/3 or 1/R, where R is the cluster radius, which reﬂects the ratio of the number of surface to bulk atoms. Examples are provided by the behaviour of the ionisation energy for alkali metal clusters and the melting temperature of gold clusters as a function of size (107). However, such scaling laws are generally an average over nonmonotonic behaviour, especially for small sizes, where properties can change signiﬁcantly from N to N + 1 atoms because the favoured geometry is diﬀerent, or the gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals is particularly large.
The existence of ‘magic numbers’ in mass spectra for cluster sizes with particular thermodynamic or kinetic stability (see Chapter 8) provides an important example of where clusters may produce insight into other, more complicated systems. If we can understand why the formation of a particular cluster size is favoured, in terms of the underlying PES, then this result may help to explain how other systems can relax to a particular structure reliably, while others do not. Magic numbers can be observed for many of the clusters discussed in the sections below, which follow a brief overview of experimental techniques (107, 110).

1.2.1 Cluster experiments
The invention of molecular beam techniques has provided both experimentalists and theoreticians with the opportunity to study ‘free’ gas-phase clusters composed of elements covering the full range of the periodic table. The distribution of cluster sizes is usually interrogated by mass spectroscopy, following ionisation if necessary, using a combination of electric or magnetic ﬁelds for deﬂection of the ions. Of course, the distribution of ion sizes may diﬀer from the neutral clusters, and ionisation can also lead to fragmentation. More detailed information can often be obtained using spectroscopic techniques that probe rotational, vibrational or electronic degrees of freedom, with or without mass selection. Mass-selected clusters may also be deposited on surfaces and then investigated using the methods of surface science, such as x-ray or electron diﬀraction techniques, atomic force microscopy or scanning and transmission electron microscopy. It has also proved possible to deposit clusters in an inert gas matrix, where various spectroscopic methods may be applied, including electron spin resonance, infrared and ultraviolet techniques. Crystalline solids composed of gold clusters passivated by thiol ligands have also been prepared and characterised by x-ray diﬀraction

Introduction

methods (111–113). ‘Quantum dots’ can also be regarded as interacting clusters with potentially interesting electrical, magnetic or optical properties (114–116).
The production of clusters in a molecular beam generally requires initial vaporisation of an atomic or molecular source, followed by cooling and condensation of the resulting fragments via nucleation, which may involve the capture of single atoms or the coalescence of larger clusters. Aggregation must also be stopped before the clusters grow too large. Thermal evaporation can be used for materials with large enough vapour pressures, while sputtering or laser vaporisation is employed for other systems. Cooling is achieved either by a supersonic expansion or a cold buﬀer gas. Materials with low vapour pressures may condense at room temperature, and most systems are found in the solid or liquid phase below 77 K, the boiling point of N2. Exceptions include the rare gases, for which supersonic expansions are used. To prepare small clusters a rapid decrease in vapour density may be required to quench the aggregation process. This decrease can be achieved either by a supersonic expansion or by careful selection of the conditions in gas aggregation experiments.
A low ﬂux of clusters travelling at subsonic velocities can sometimes be produced by heating a volatile liquid or solid in a Knudsen cell, which has a small aperture through which evaporated species can escape. Alternatively, supersonic nozzles (or free jet condensation) may provide a more intense source. For inert gases and volatile metals such as mercury, the beam is usually produced by expansion through a small nozzle into a region of low pressure. For other materials a carrier gas may be required to provide an eﬃcient cluster source. Another common technique combines pulsed laser ablation of a target with a supersonic jet expansion; in a pulsed-arc source the laser vaporisation is replaced by an intense electrical discharge.
Sputtering sources are somewhat diﬀerent, in that a target is bombarded with high energy inert gas ions, while spray sources are used to generate clusters from liquids and solutions. Large clusters can be produced by gas aggregation techniques where the products of evaporation are mixed with a cold inert gas to quench them. In each case the size distribution that is obtained can depend quite sensitively upon factors like the diameter of the aperture or nozzle and the temperature and pressure of the carrier gas.
Cluster ions can be produced in several ways. Impact with thermal electrons or a focused electron beam may produce positive ions, as well as fragmentation of the initial cluster (107). Photoionisation using a laser source is generally more controllable than methods involving electron impact or

electrical discharges, while anionic clusters may be generated by electron transfer between atoms with diﬀerent ionisation energies, or via capture of low energy electrons by a neutral atom or molecule.
Mass selection or detection of ionic clusters can be achieved using timeof-ﬂight mass spectrometry, separate magnetic and electric ﬁelds, a Wien ﬁlter, with crossed homogeneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds, a quadrupole mass ﬁlter, with alternating and static electric ﬁelds, or cyclotron resonance spectroscopy, where the ions are conﬁned in a trap using a static electric ﬁeld and a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Ion traps have also been combined with electron diﬀraction experiments to obtain direct insight into the structure of charged clusters such as (CsI)N Cs+ (117) and C+60 (118). Neutral clusters can be mass selected by deﬂection using an intersecting beam of inert gas atoms, or by reneutralising ions that have previously been mass selected (119).
High resolution spectroscopy can provide exceptionally detailed information in favourable cases, and far-infrared vibration–rotation tunnelling spectroscopy (120–123) has had a particularly important impact on the study of small water clusters. The resolution achieved in such experiments is comparable to that of microwave spectroscopy. However, lower resolution techniques, such as photoelectron spectroscopy, photofragmentation, collisioninduced fragmentation or dissociation can also be valuable.
A number of other imaginative techniques have been used to obtain indirect and even direct structural information. For example, in ﬂow-reactor experiments small molecules such as N2, H2 and CO are used to ‘titrate’ the surface binding sites of transition metal clusters (124–127). ‘Ion chromatography’ experiments are based on the mobility of cluster ions as they are dragged through a buﬀer gas by an applied electric ﬁeld; the higher the collisional cross-section, the slower the cluster moves. This technique has been applied to a variety of systems, and has provided new insight into the formation of fullerenes, for example (128–131). These studies, as well as Coulomb explosion experiments (132), electron diﬀraction results on clusters in molecular beams, and x-ray diﬀraction results for deposited clusters, usually require a structural model to interpret them, thus providing gainful employment for theoreticians.

1.2.2 Structures based on multilayer polyhedra
Some of the common packing schemes exhibited by atomic clusters are based on the ﬁve Platonic solids, namely the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, pentagonal dodecahedron and icosahedron, or on the rhombic dodecahedron

and rhombic triacontahedron, which were ﬁrst described by Kepler (Fig. 1.3) (103, 137). The latter two polyhedra have 12 and 30 rhombic faces, respectively. A rhombic dodecahedral shell of atoms can be cut from a bodycentred-cubic (bcc) lattice, while metallic growth on a C60 molecule may produce a triacontahedron (103).
Kepler also introduced the face-centred-cubic packing scheme, and commented that it provided the densest possible packing of hard spheres, namely a packing fraction of 0.74. Although the densest packing of four spheres is a tetrahedron, it is not possible to pack ﬁve regular tetrahedra around a common edge or twenty regular tetrahedra around a common vertex, without leaving a gap (Fig. 1.4). However, it is possible to maximise the number

of nearest-neighbour contacts for seven and thirteen spheres using ﬁve or twenty distorted tetrahedra, respectively. The polytetrahedral structures obtained by adding successive distorted tetrahedra to the pentagonal bipyramid so as to maximise nearest-neighbour contacts, shown in Fig. 1.5, are common structures for a variety of ligated and bare atomic clusters (134,138). The geometries based on distorted tetrahedra are subject to strain or frustration (139,140) (Section 9.4), because not all the nearest-neighbour contacts can have the same distance, and hence some contacts are stretched relative to the separation that would be favoured by optimising purely local interactions. The concept of strain plays a key role in understanding how the range of a pair potential determines the most favourable geometrical packing, as discussed in Section 8.4.1.
Many diﬀerent clusters can be described as layers of close-packed atoms stacked on top of each other. The two most commonly encountered cubic close-packing schemes are the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) and facecentred-cubic (fcc) patterns shown in Fig. 1.6. Multi-shell cuboctahedra and octahedra with Oh point group symmetry can both be cut from an fcc lattice, as shown in Fig. 1.7. However, the cuboctahedra expose {100} faces, where the atoms have relatively low coordination numbers, while the octahedra have large surface areas, and so the most favourable fcc packing scheme for clusters is usually based on truncated octahedra (Fig. 1.7).
In fact, structures based on icosahedral packing are often more favourable for a variety of clusters, if the strain energy is not too large (Section 8.3.1 and Section 8.4.1). Complete Mackay icosahedra (146) expose only {111} close-packed type faces, as shown in Fig. 1.8. The total number of atoms in

which produces the sequence 13, 55, 147, 309, 561, 923, 1415, . . . The vertex coordinates f√or a regular icosahedron can be written in terms of

Hence, for an icosahedron with an atom in the middle the radial distance must be about 5% less than the nearest-neighbour distances in the icosahedral shell itself, which provides a quantitative indication of the strain. Aside from clusters, icosahedra also occur naturally in virus capsids (147, 148) and self-assembling lipid bilayers in salt-free solutions of

anionic and cationic surfactants (142). Icosahedral packing of B12 subunits has also been characterised in boron suboxide (143) (Fig. 1.9). A general geometrical construction due to Coxeter enables atomic coordinates for structures belonging to icosahedral point groups to be constructed systematically (149, 150).
A sequence of complete decahedra can be constructed from the sevenatom decahedron in Fig. 1.3, and the total number of atoms in this case is 5(n + 1)3/6 + (n + 1)/6 (103). However, although the exposed faces are all close-packed, the surface area is relatively high, and truncated decahedra that expose {100} faces, known as Ino decahedra (144), are more favourable. The number of atoms in the sequence of complete Ino decahedra with square {100} faces is also given by equation (1.2). In fact, the same numerical sequence occurs for cuboctahedra with square and triangular faces (Fig. 1.7), and there is a relatively simple deformation pathway that links these structures to Mackay icosahedra of the same size (Fig. 4.8). Squarefaced Ino decahedra and Mackay icosahedra can also be interconverted by a half-twist about any of the six ﬁve-fold axes (151). It is therefore not surprising that several studies have compared the relative energies of these clusters (152–155) for various model potentials, even though more favourable

decahedral and close-packed geometries are probably available (156–160). Marks decahedra with reentrant {111} faces (145) (Fig. 1.10) and truncated octahedra with hexagonal and square faces (Fig. 1.7) are likely to lie lower in energy (Section 8.3.1), although complete geometries with high symmetry do not occur at the same sizes. Figures 1.7, 1.8 and 1.10 were constructed using geometries obtained in reference (161).

Similarly, complete rhombic dodecahedra contain 4n3 + 6n2 + 4n + 1 atoms, i.e. 15, 65, 175, 369, . . . for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (103). Some other structural motifs based on polytetrahedral packing (162) and the 98-atom Leary tetrahedron are considered in Section 3.6 and Section 8.4.4, respectively.
Examination of mass spectra as a function of cluster size usually reveals systematic features corresponding to high and low intensity, and the high intensity features are often referred to as ‘magic numbers’, a term borrowed from nuclear physics. The best known example is probably the C60 peak observed by Kroto et al. (164) in a mass spectrum generated from laser vaporised graphite (Fig. 1.11), which ultimately led to the birth of fullerene science (Section 8.6). However, some caution is generally advisable in associating the peaks in a mass spectrum with structures of special stability, since the spectrum may change signiﬁcantly with the experimental conditions. The distribution may also reﬂect kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, stability, as found for clusters of C60 molecules (Section 8.4.4), or it may correspond to fragmentation products. Plotting the intensity peaks as a function

Distinguishing between diﬀerent packing schemes usually requires more than just a couple of magic number peaks to be identiﬁed. For example, a series of peaks at N = 13, 55, 147, . . . corresponds to complete icosahedra, cuboctahedra with square and triangular faces, as well as square-faced Ino decahedra. However, intermediate structures with relatively high stability in these three families occur at diﬀerent sizes, and further analysis of this subshell structure often reveals a growth scheme based on icosahedra (103, 165–184). Decahedral and icosahedral structures are commonly observed for metal clusters supported on surfaces (160), and other packing schemes have also been found in the gas phase, some of which are mentioned in the following sections, as well as Section 8.4.4.
1.2.3 Clusters of rare gas atoms
Rare gas clusters were among the ﬁrst to be examined experimentally, and remain a favourite system for both experimentalists and theoreticians because they are relatively easy to study (107, 184). For example, the interatomic potential is primarily due to dispersion forces, which can be modelled quite successfully by the Lennard-Jones potential (Section 6.7.1, Section 8.3) (135). Accurate descriptions are available from more sophisticated functions (185), which may also include many-body terms (186).

Introduction

Rare gas clusters can be prepared by supersonic expansion into a vacuum, and are generally detected as cations, which are formed by electron impact or photoionisation. The observed abundances may therefore reﬂect the stability of the cations rather than the neutral clusters. Experimental results for rare gas clusters show clear evidence for a growth scheme based upon icosahedra up to more than a thousand atoms (165–175,184,187); some example spectra are reproduced in Fig. 1.12. This interpretation is also supported by evidence from electron diﬀraction experiments (188–190).
The results for xenon clusters in Fig. 1.12 are particularly easy to interpret. First there are the intense peaks at N = 13, 55 and 147 corresponding to complete Mackay icosahedra. The smaller features at N = 19 and 23 correspond to double and triple icosahedra, which are formed by growth of an anti-Mackay overlayer (Fig. 1.13), where the atoms occupy hcp-type sites (Fig. 1.6). This overlayer is completed at 45 atoms to give a rhombic triacontahedron (Fig. 1.3), which can also be described as an icosahedron of interpenetrating icosahedra. Hence structures based on the anti-Mackay packing scheme have also been described as ‘polyicosahedral’ (188,189,192). For most systems the Mackay overlayer, which corresponds to fcc-type sites (Fig. 1.6), becomes more favourable well before the rhombic triacontahedron is reached at N = 45. An exception to this rule appears to occur for a C60 molecule covered by alkaline earth atoms (193). Favourable anti-Mackay overlayers have also been found in ab initio calculations for lithium clusters up to Li45 (194), and in tight-binding calculations for sodium clusters up to Na34 (195). These crossovers for relatively large anti-Mackay overlayers are favoured for longer-ranged interatomic potentials, as discussed in Section 8.4.1 (196). The prominent peak at Xe+71 in Fig. 1.12 is probably due to an

anti-Mackay structure that corresponds to coverage of ﬁve faces surrounding a vertex of the Mackay icosahedron at N = 55.
Helium clusters are qualitatively diﬀerent from clusters of other rare gases because of the relatively weak binding energy and high zero-point energy, caused by the low atomic mass. Superﬂuid He-II occurs below 2.18 K and 0.003 K for bulk 3He and 4He, respectively, and helium clusters also exhibit a number of other interesting properties (107, 197), particularly when they have been doped with a chromophore such as SF6 (198–203) or the water hexamer (204, 205).

1.2.4 Clusters of molecules
Molecular clusters can be obtained as aggregates of species such as H2O, CO2, N2, H2, methanol, benzene and even C60 (Section 8.4.4), and may contain anything from two to hundreds or thousands of molecules (100– 103, 107, 206, 208–212). These systems are of particular interest in the study of intermolecular forces (50, 51), and high resolution spectroscopy of small complexes containing two or three atoms or molecules has provided useful data in this area.
Larger molecular clusters are important in atmospheric chemistry for studies of ozone depletion, climate change and acid rain. Clusters doped with a single ‘solute’ molecule may also provide insight into the solvation process, which can then be studied as a function of the number of solvent molecules. Successive enthalpies of hydration have been measured experimentally for halide and alkali metal ions bound to water clusters, and similar measurements have been performed for other solvents (107, 206, 213). Chemical reactions may also be promoted and studied in clusters, and some experiments ﬁrst generate cationic systems using electron impact ionisation (107, 206, 210).
Water clusters deﬁne a ﬁeld in their own right (123,214–217), and a number of examples are discussed in subsequent chapters, especially in Section 8.7. Explaining the tunnelling splittings revealed by high resolution studies of small neutral water clusters requires a detailed analysis of the underlying rearrangement mechanisms (Section 4.5).
A magic number in the mass spectra of protonated water clusters, (H2O)N H+, appears at N = 21 under a range of experimental conditions (Fig. 1.14) (218–220). For mixed clusters with trimethylamine (TMA) the optimum number of TMA molecules coordinated to (H2O)21H+ is ten, suggesting a dodecahedral structure with the H3O+ hydronium ion in the middle, leaving ten free hydrogen atoms on the surface for binding to TMA

1.2.5 Clusters of metal atoms The study of metal clusters can be traced back at least as far as Michael Faraday, who investigated the optical properties of colloidal gold particles

(222). Theoretical treatments range through the liquid drop model, which treats the cluster as a uniform conducting sphere, ‘jellium’ models, which consider an electron gas interacting with a uniform positively charged sphere, empirical potentials, in which the electronic structure is subsumed into an analytical force ﬁeld, up to high level ab initio treatments (99, 100, 107, 221, 223–225).
The liquid drop model is essentially a classical electrostatic treatment, which predicts that both the ionisation potential and the electron aﬃnity of the cluster should vary as the inverse of the radius (or as 1/N 1/3). These trends are both reproduced quite well experimentally (226), although quantum eﬀects due to the completion of electronic shells and features that depend upon details of the nuclear geometry are obviously not included. For example, even–odd alternations in the ionisation potential of small sodium clusters and magnetic eﬀects in iron and nickel clusters are not reproduced. Mie developed a classical electrodynamical theory, based on the liquid drop model, to predict that the shift and line width of the surface plasmon frequency relative to that of the bulk metal should also scale inversely with the radius (227). The surface plasmon is a collective electronic excitation, which carries nearly all the oscillator strength in larger metal clusters, giving a single peak in the electronic spectrum. It corresponds to a correlated motion of the valence level electrons relative to the nuclear framework.
The ﬁrst mass spectra obtained for alkali metal clusters (228–232) revealed magic number peaks for N = 2, 8, 10, 40, 58, . . . (Fig. 1.15). To account for these results a quantum mechanical treatment of the electronic structure is needed, and the jellium models that resulted basically amount to ﬁnding the energy levels for a one-electron Hamiltonian with an eﬀective radial potential, V (r). Diﬀerent potentials, such as a harmonic well or the Woods– Saxon form, V (r) = −V0/ (1 + exp [(r − r0)/a]), where V0, r0 and a are parameters, can give slightly diﬀerent orderings for the resulting states. In fact the basic order of the low-lying levels can largely be predicted using the spherical symmetry, by counting nodes in the wavefunctions for a free electron in a sphere. A typical calculation gives (228, 229):

1s < 2p < 3d < 2s < 3f < 3p < 4g < 4d < 3s < 5h,

(1.3)

where the 4d function, for example, has principal and angular quantum numbers n = 4 and l = 2, with two angular nodes and one radial node, in a notation analogous to that used for atomic orbitals. An alternative notation for the principal quantum number, which is more conventional in nuclear physics, is also commonly used. Although the true eigenfunctions for a radial

potential that varies with r are no longer the free electron wavefunctions, the perturbation of the free electron energy levels for these low-lying states is relatively small, and the mixings that occur can easily be predicted. Closed shells therefore occur for 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40, 56, 58, . . . electrons, in accord with experiments. Magic number peaks for alkali metals, noble metals, and divalent metals, such as zinc and cadmium (231), have all been explained in this way (107). For copper, silver and gold intensity maxima occur at N = 9, 21, 35, . . . (231, 233), but since the cations have one less electron than the neutrals these results are consistent with the same pattern of oneelectron states. The agreement is not so good for trivalent metals, which is not surprising in view of the likely participation of atomic p orbitals in the bonding of such systems. Stone’s tensor surface harmonic theory (97, 234– 236), which includes both quantum and structural eﬀects explicitly, suggests that wavefunctions based on tensor spherical harmonics are needed in this situation. This approach has been successfully applied to a wide variety of clusters (97). The jellium model itself can be improved by allowing for non-spherical geometries (237, 238).
For larger alkali metal clusters two sources of periodicity have been observed in mass spectral intensities (239–243). These eﬀects are most clearly revealed by plotting a shell index, which counts the dips in relative intensity, against N 1/3, as shown in Fig. 1.16. The structure below about 2000 atoms corresponds to near degeneracies that occur for jellium energy

Fig. 1.16. Plotting the shell index for NaN clusters against N 1/3 reveals two types of ‘shell’ structure.

levels with large n or l quantum numbers having the same value of 3n − 2l, using the atomic orbital deﬁnition of the principal quantum number (107,224). These degeneracies can be explained using semi-classical theories (223,224,239,241), and the resulting bunchings in the energy level spectrum have been termed supershells.
The periodicity in the mass spectral intensity variation for larger alkali metal clusters corresponds to the results expected for geometrical shells of atoms based on Mackay icosahedral packing, or the alternative schemes with the same magic numbers, discussed in Section 1.2.2. The mass spectra of alkaline earth metals (103,107,180,181,244–246), i.e. beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium, and various other experiments (177,179,182) and calculations (159) for nickel and cobalt clusters, also provide evidence of icosahedral structure in both small and larger clusters. Small aluminium and indium clusters show some magic numbers that have been interpreted in terms of electronic shell closings, while clusters with more than about a thousand atoms exhibit geometric shell structures based upon octahedra (103, 247–251).

Introduction

The development of properties such as conductivity and magnetism in metal clusters has also proved to be a fruitful area of research. For example, experiments on HgN clusters have been interpreted in terms of a transition from van der Waals to metallic bonding over the size range N = 13–70 (252–255). Such metal–insulator transitions (256) are of interest for the construction of new materials, and have also been observed for compressed monolayers of silver ‘quantum dots’ (116) and gold clusters (257).
The magnetic properties of free iron, cobalt and nickel clusters have been studied using Stern–Gerlach-type experiments where a molecular beam is deﬂected by an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (258–264). The deﬂection of larger clusters in a single direction has been explained using a superparamagnetic model, where all the magnetic moments are aligned with the applied ﬁeld if the temperature is not too high. The eﬀective magnetic moment is µ [coth(N µB/kT ) − kT /N µB], where µ is the magnetic moment per atom, B is the applied magnetic ﬁeld, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature. The large moments observed for nickel clusters are signiﬁcantly reduced by the adsorption of a single CO molecule on the surface (265). Rhodium (266,267) and manganese (268) clusters have also been found to exhibit superparamagnetic behaviour.
High level ab initio calculations are feasible for small metal clusters (225, 269). Larger systems are commonly treated using either empirical potentials or density functional theory (DFT) (33). Empirical potentials include the Finnis–Sinclair (270, 271), Sutton–Chen (272), embedded-atom (273–276), Murrell–Mottram (277), Gupta (278), bond-order (279), and effective medium (280–284) forms. These functions often incorporate manybody eﬀects using a term that represents the square root of the electron density, as suggested by the second moment approximation of tight-binding theory (285). For example, Sutton–Chen potentials are deﬁned by

c is a dimensionless parameter, is a parameter with dimensions of energy, a is the lattice constant, and m and n are positive integers with n > m.
DFT calculations have been used to predict disordered global minima for zinc, cadmium and gold clusters (286, 287) and to analyse gold clusters passivated by thiol and thiolate ligands (288–290). X-ray diﬀraction patterns obtained for powder and thin ﬁlm samples of these passivated clusters (111)

have been interpreted in terms of both Marks decahedra (145) and truncated octahedra, depending on the size. However, some calculations suggest that the underlying gold clusters should be unsymmetrical (289).

1.2.6 Clusters of non-metal atoms
In this section a few examples will be chosen from the wide variety of clusters involving main group atoms that have been studied experimentally and theoretically. The ability of carbon to form clusters is amply demonstrated by the growth of research into fullerenes and carbon nanotubes (291, 292); the potential energy surface of buckminsterfullerene itself is considered in Section 8.6. Incorporation of atoms such as lanthanum, uranium and potassium into a fullerene cage was achieved in early experiments (293) by laser vaporising a graphite sample treated with a solution of an appropriate metal salt. Such endohedral complexes are written as La@C60, for instance. Laser irradiation of endohedral fullerenes with an intense source leads to sequential loss of C2 fragments from the carbon cage until the metal becomes ‘shrink-wrapped’ (294, 295). It is also possible to coat fullerenes with metal atoms such as calcium, strontium and barium and main group atoms such as sulphur and phosphorus (103, 296–299). Particularly strong peaks were observed for Ca32C60 and Ca37C60, suggesting that one metal atom sits over each fullerene face in these clusters. Larger clusters are probably based on icosahedral packing, but the structures are diﬀerent from Mackay icosahedra (103). Clusters of fullerenes are discussed in Section 8.4.4.
Evidence of a structural transition between prolate and oblate shapes for silicon clusters has been obtained from comparison of calculations with ion mobility experiments. (300–303). The prolate geometries may be based on stacks of trigonal prisms. Germanium clusters exhibit the same intensity peaks in mass spectra for small sizes, but drift tube measurements suggest that the structures diverge from those of silicon clusters above a certain size (304).
Small alkali halide clusters are discussed in Section 5.2 and Section 8.5. The mass spectra contain peaks that correspond to complete cuboids, which expose only {100} faces (305–308). Metal chalcogenide clusters, such as cadmium selenide, are interesting because they may undergo pressure-induced structural transformations from wurzite to rocksalt and zinc blende to rocksalt structures (309–312).
The ﬁnal clusters that will be mentioned in this section are the metallocarbohedrenes, or ‘met-cars’, which are cage compounds whose vertices are

composed of a mixture of carbon and metal atoms (314–316). The ﬁrst metcar observed as a high intensity peak in a mass spectrum was Ti8C12 (314), and compounds containing titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, chromium, molybdenum and iron have also been prepared, including mixed metal clusters. Met-cars with the formula M8C12 appear to be particularly stable, and both dodecahedral and tetracapped tetrahedral structures (Fig. 1.17) have been proposed (313, 317, 318).
1.3 Proteins
Proteins are unbranched polymer chains formed from chemical bonding between amino acid building blocks with the general formula NH2CαRHCO2H (319). In cells they are synthesised on ribosomes, and they are involved in functions ranging from catalysis of diverse chemical reactions to maintaining the chemical potential across cell membranes. The four-fold coordinated α carbon atom is sp3 hybridised and is connected to an amino group, NH2 (NH for proline), a carboxylic acid group, CO2H, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain, R, by σ bonds. Most proteins are composed of just 20 diﬀerent amino acids, which are distinguished by the identity of the side chain (Fig. 1.18). In these α amino acids the carboxyl and amine groups are attached to the same carbon. There is also one naturally occurring β amino acid, β alanine H2NCH2CH2CO2H, where the amine group is connected to the ﬁrst carbon atom of the side chain, rather than to the α carbon atom.

It is often helpful to divide these commonly encountered amino acids into three classes, depending upon whether the side chain is hydrophobic (Section 1.3.4), charged, or polar:

hydrophobic:
charged: polar:

alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, tryptophan aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine serine, threonine, tyrosine, histidine, cysteine, asparagine, glutamine

Glycine, where the side chain, R, is just a hydrogen atom, is usually considered in a class on its own, or is added to the set of hydrophobic structures. Both three- and one-letter abbreviations for the amino acids are commonly used, as shown in Fig. 1.18. In all the amino acids, except for glycine, the Cα carbon atom is joined to four diﬀerent groups, and these structures are optically active, because they cannot be superimposed on their mirror images. Most chemical reactions in biological systems are highly speciﬁc for diﬀerent structures, and naturally occurring proteins contain only L optical isomers for each amino acid, rather than the D forms (Fig. 1.19). In terms of absolute conﬁguration all the natural amino acids are classiﬁed as ‘S’, except for cysteine, which is ‘R’.
The covalent linkage between two amino acid residues is known as a peptide bond (Fig. 1.20). The formation of a peptide bond may be written as a condensation process between the amino group of one residue and the carboxyl group of the other:

NH2CαRHCO2H + NH2CαR HCO2H → NH2CαRHCONHCαR HCO2H + H2O

Six atoms around each peptide bond are constrained to lie in a plane because the adjacent nitrogen and carbon atoms in the −NH−CO− unit are sp2 hybridised. In contrast, rotation about the Cα−CO, Cα−NH, and Cα−R bonds is hindered mainly by steric interactions between nonbonded atoms. The corresponding angles are conventionally labelled ψ, φ and χ, as shown in Fig. 1.21. An angle ω is sometimes also deﬁned for the CO−NH peptide bond, to describe any deviation from planarity. All the peptide bonds in Figs. 1.20 and 1.21 correspond to ω = 180◦, where the two Cα groups are in

Introduction

the trans conﬁguration. Cis conﬁgurations with ω = 0◦ and the Cα carbons closer together are usually energetically unfavourable because of steric interactions between the side chains. The distance between the Cα carbons is about 3.8 ˚A in the trans conﬁguration, but falls to only about 2.8 ˚A in the cis conﬁguration. Proline residues provide an exception to this rule, since here the cis and trans conﬁgurations are generally closer in energy because the nitrogen atom is bonded to two carbons instead of a carbon and a hydrogen, i.e. it is an imino, not an amino, acid. In unfolded proteins it is usual to observe about 10% of the proline groups in the cis conﬁguration. Isomerisation to the correct form may exhibit a half life of between 10 and 100 s at room temperature, which is relatively slow, and in vivo this process can be catalysed by peptidyl prolyl isomerase enzymes (319). Cis prolines are also found for some native protein structures in regions where the polypeptide chain bends sharply.
For most combinations of φ and ψ angles the amino acid side chains encounter overlap or unfavourable steric interactions with the main polypeptide chain. Plotting observed ψ and φ angles against each other in a Ramachandran plot (322) reveals that the favoured combinations are clustered in particular regions (Fig. 1.22). The most probable {φ, ψ} combinations visible in Fig. 1.22 are associated with β strands and α helices, as discussed in Section 1.3.1. Only glycine, for which steric interactions are generally much smaller, has more freedom to explore the {φ, ψ} dihedral angle space, and this residue can therefore permit more unusual main chain conformations to appear. Two proteins are homologous if they are derived from a common precursor (2), which usually means that they exhibit similarities in structure and sequence, but may have diﬀerent functions. Because of the unique role that glycine can play in determining the folded structure it is often conserved in homologous proteins. A high degree of sequence similarity may therefore point to a common ancestral gene.
Cysteine residues in diﬀerent parts of a polypeptide chain can also play a distinct role in determining the folded structure of a protein by combining to form disulphide bridges. The cysteine residues are oxidised in this process, which can be represented schematically as

In fact this process usually takes place via exchange of sulphide bonds with the monomeric and dimeric forms of glutathione in an oxidising cellular environment (319).

The probability distribution takes its largest values in the regions shaded red and decreases through the yellow regions into the least probable {φ, ψ} combinations, which are shaded white. The three distinct maxima are associated with β strands, right-handed α helices and left-handed α helices (labelled L), which correspond to elements of secondary structure, as discussed in Section 1.3.1.

1.3.1 Basic elements of protein structure
The primary structure of a protein is deﬁned as the sequence of amino acids from which it is built, and is encoded by triplets (codons) of the nucleotides adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine in DNA. The primary sequence is considered to run from the N-terminus to the C-terminus, which have free amine and carboxylic acid groups, respectively, or corresponding derivatives. The main chain of the protein contains relatively polar peptide bonds where the −NH−CO− sequence is regularly repeated. In the unfolded state, where

the protein backbone is accessible to solvent, the NH and CO groups act as hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, respectively. To form a compact folded structure new interactions are required to replace these favourable solvent interactions. Proteins solve this problem by forming α helices and β sheets, where the main chain NH and CO groups form intramolecular hydrogen-bonds with each other, and these elements of secondary structure are recognisably similar in virtually all natural proteins, although they vary in size and amino acid composition.
The existence of the α helix was ﬁrst predicted in 1951, based upon geometrical considerations and analysis of peptide bonds in small molecules (325, 326). This prediction received immediate support from the x-ray diﬀraction patterns observed for keratin and haemoglobin (327), and later from the high resolution structure obtained for myoglobin, where all the secondary structure consists of α helices (328, 329). Helices are formed by linking NH hydrogen-bond donors and CO hydrogen-bond acceptors at regular intervals for groups between two and ﬁve residues apart along the main chain (Fig. 1.23). Most helices in naturally occurring proteins are righthanded α helices (Fig. 1.24) where the repeat unit includes 3.6 residues per turn, corresponding to a distance of about 5.4 ˚A, or 1.5 ˚A per amino acid. Left-handed α helices and 27 helices are rarely observed, but 310 and 516 (π) helices do occasionally occur, although the diﬀerent repeats make these structures rather strained, and so they are normally only found at the end of an α helix, or as single turns. If amino acids were constructed from D- rather

than L-amino acids then the most favourable α helix would be left-handed instead.
α helices in globular proteins may contain anywhere between four and about forty residues, and the average length is about three turns, which corresponds to ten amino acids and a distance of about 15 ˚A. Ala, glu, leu and met are the most common residues in helices, while pro, gly, tyr and ser are the least common. α helices are responsible for the local maximum in the probability density around {φ, ψ} = {−60◦, −50◦} in a Ramachandran plot. Because the peptide nitrogen atom in proline is already part of a ring it cannot participate very well in further hydrogen-bonding. Prolines therefore cause a signiﬁcant bend in a helix unless they are part of the ﬁrst turn, and are often referred to as helix breakers.
Since the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are more electronegative than the carbon and hydrogen atoms, each CO· · · HN sequence corresponds to partial charges of the form δ+, δ−, δ+, δ−, and the helix is associated with a dipole moment directed along its axis with the positive end at the N-terminus, as deﬁned in Fig. 1.23. α helices are usually found on the outside of proteins, with one side facing the core of the folded structure and the other facing the solvent. The side chains protrude from the helix, and it is energetically favourable for charged and polar groups to interact with a polar solvent, such as water, while the nonpolar hydrophobic side chains face the core. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues therefore commonly repeat every three or four residues to give an amphipathic α helix. Helices where every seventh residue is leucine can pack against each other to bury these

hydrophobic residues and form ‘leucine zippers’ (319). α domain proteins with a coiled-coil structure also exhibit heptad repeats (319).
The other common element of secondary structure in a protein is the β sheet, and here the hydrogen bonding is less local because the donor and acceptor NH and CO groups may be separated by relatively large distances along the polypeptide chain. The main chain conformation is locally extended, corresponding to {φ, ψ} pairs that are concentrated in the top left of the Ramachandran diagram in Fig. 1.22. These β strands are aligned adjacent to one another so that hydrogen-bonds can form between the NH donors of one strand and the CO acceptors of the other. When several strands are involved the result is a ‘pleated’ β sheet, where the Cα atoms and their side chains lie successively above and below the plane (Fig. 1.25).
There are two ways for the β strands to align themselves. In an antiparallel β sheet the NH and CO groups of one peptide unit form hydrogenbonds to make rings containing ten atoms in total, which contain no other atoms aside from two Cα carbons (Fig. 1.26). In a parallel β sheet the rings contain twelve atoms, including additional nitrogen and carbon atoms

Introduction

only account for about 20% of observed β secondary structure in natural proteins (319). β sheets are generally twisted due to an inherent twist in each strand, which is energetically favourable (330, 331).
Most proteins can be described in terms of discrete α helices and β sheets connected together by loop regions, which vary in their length and shape. These loops are usually found on the surface of the protein because they lack complementary residues in the protein with which to make additional hydrogen bonds. Hence loop regions are often rich in polar or charged amino acids. When the sequences of homologous proteins are compared the loop regions are generally found to exhibit the most insertions or deletions, since these can be accommodated without disrupting the packing between the elements of secondary structure (319). A β hairpin is formed from two aligned antiparallel β strands and the loop that connects them. Short hairpin loops are called reverse turns, or just ‘turns’, because they enable the main chain to change direction.
Reduced representations of α helices and β sheets are shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25, where the helices appear as cylindrical coils and the strands of a sheet as arrows, which conventionally point from the amino to the carboxyl end of the protein. The intervening regions are simply represented by ribbons. Such diagrams are a much more useful guide to protein structure than an all-atom diagram, where the main chain and secondary structure can be very diﬃcult to discern (332).
A motif, or supersecondary structure, is a combination of secondary structural elements that is found in a number of diﬀerent proteins. Identiﬁcation of motifs is useful because they are often associated with a particular function. For example, helix-turn-helix motifs are associated with binding to calcium or DNA (319) (Fig. 1.27). The simplest motif involving

β structure is the β hairpin containing two antiparallel strands separated by a loop (Fig. 1.28), while four antiparallel β strands are often found to be arranged in a ‘Greek key’ motif (Fig. 1.29). The simplest motif containing both α and β structure is probably the β-α-β motif illustrated in Fig. 1.30. More complicated motifs can often be regarded as combinations of simpler motifs.

is termed a domain, and the tertiary protein structure refers to the way that the motifs are arranged into one or more domains. A number of proteins consist of subunits, each of which is formed from one or more domains corresponding to a single polypeptide chain, and the arrangement of the subunits deﬁnes a quaternary structure (Fig. 1.31). Although most proteins can be described as globular, structural proteins are often ﬁbrous with extended conﬁgurations.
Protein domains are often further classiﬁed as α, β, α/β or α + β when the protein is composed of α helices, antiparallel β sheets (usually two sheets packed against each other), β-α-β motifs that form a predominantly antiparallel β sheet structure with α helices on the outside, or α and β secondary structure that is separated in space (333).
α domain proteins include coiled-coil proteins, where two α helices wind around each other, the globins myoglobin and haemoglobin, and four-helix bundles (Fig. 1.32) (319). The coiled-coil arrangement allows hydrophobic side chains to be packed together to give ﬁbrous proteins such as keratins, which occur in skin, hair and feathers, and the muscle protein myosin (Fig. 1.32). β domain structures probably involve the widest range of functions, and include enzymes, antibodies and transport proteins. The number of β strands involved ranges from about four to ten, and the inherent twist that occurs in each strand can produce an overall barrel-like structure (Fig. 1.33). α/β proteins are further classiﬁed into barrel, horseshoe and open sheet structures (319). The barrel structure was ﬁrst characterised in

triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), and is therefore sometimes called a TIM barrel (Fig. 1.34); the β strands form a parallel β sheet with the α helices outside. Open sheet structures contain an open twisted β sheet surrounded by α helices, while horseshoe structures contain a repeated pattern of leucine residues and exhibit a curved parallel β sheet with the α helices outside (Fig. 1.34). The α/β class is the one most commonly encountered for enzymes. The α + β protein staphylococcus nuclease is illustrated in Fig. 1.35.
Domain structures, such as those described above, are sometimes referred to as tertiary motifs, architectures, or simply ‘folds’ (334). The term ‘structure’ may also be used in a more restricted sense to describe only the main chain geometry. Hence, two proteins with essentially superimposable main chains may be said to have the same ‘structure’ (or ‘topology’) even if they have diﬀerent amino acid sequences. Topologies that are found

It has been estimated that the number of diﬀerent domain structures in naturally occurring proteins is of the order of a thousand (339–341), a factor of about a hundred less than the total number of sequences in the human genome.
An alternative classiﬁcation scheme for proteins is based on sequence similarities, and this approach is useful because of the implications for protein

diﬀraction. The latter technique can provide a high level of structural resolution, but the experimental conditions are much more elaborate. However, it has also been used to study dynamics by monitoring the exchange of NH protons with deuterons from a labelled solvent (2). A summary of some of the experimental techniques available for investigating proteins is illustrated in Fig. 1.36. NMR spectroscopy has also been used to study the rate of exchange of amide hydrogens (342–344), and this information can be used to infer details of the folding pathway if we assume that the exchange rate decreases as the amide group becomes less accessible to the solvent. This approach revealed that the rate at which amide groups become shielded from exchange is rather diﬀerent for the two structural domains of lysozyme (345, 346). The NH protons are protected from 2H/1H isotope exchange either by involvement in stable secondary structure, or simply because they are buried in a hydrophobic core. NMR relaxation data can also provide an indication of the dynamical properties of both backbone and side chain groups, and has been used to estimate conformational entropies (347).
In model peptides α and β elements of secondary structure generally appear to form in a few hundred nanoseconds (348) and a few microseconds, respectively (Chapter 9) (349–351), i.e. formation of helices is about ten times faster. The overall rate constants involved in protein folding typically lie in the range from 1 s−1 to 107 s−1, and the experimental techniques used to measure them include rapid mixing and sampling methods, such as continuous-ﬂow, stopped-ﬂow and quenched-ﬂow, ﬂash photolysis for suitable reactions, such as dissociation of carbon monoxide from

pulses at closely spaced intervals to excite tryptophan ﬂuorescence, although additional diagnostics may also be needed (358).
The ‘dead time’ associated with mixing experiments is also being progressively reduced by improved techniques (359), and these advances are especially important for systems where collapse occurs rapidly (360). Stopped-ﬂow optical experiments were used to complement hydrogen exchange measurements for lysozyme (360–363), including circular dichroism (CD) studies, which reveal the degree of secondary structure formation. Folding rates are usually obtained by ﬁrst unfolding the protein with a chemical denaturant such as guanidinium chloride or urea, and then diluting the denaturant to begin the refolding process.
The formation of disulphide bridges in protein folding requires oxidation of cysteine residues, a process that is generally assisted catalytically by enzymes. The corresponding pathways can be investigated in some detail in vitro by introducing variable concentrations of a disulphide, RSSR, and the reduced thiol, RSH, and studying the distribution of products as a function of time by quenching (364,365). Such experiments have yielded considerable insight into the folding of the 58-residue protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), which contains three disulphide bridges in the native state (Fig. 1.37) (365–367). Intermediates with one or two disulphide bonds can be isolated; formation of the ﬁnal disulphide bond on the surface of the folded protein is rapid once the other bonds have formed (365).
Another probe of folding that involves a fortuitous property of one particular amino acid is ﬂuorescence quenching of tryptophan residues. Tryptophans typically absorb radiation in the range 275 to 295 nm, and emit it again at lower energy in the range 330 to 340 nm (Section 2.4). However,

the ﬂuorescence can be repressed, or quenched, by small molecules in the solvent, such as iodide ions, oxygen and nitroxides, if the tryptophan is solvent accessible. Residues that are buried typically exhibit limited quenching and a blue shift that results from the relatively nonpolar environment in the protein core. Following the ﬂuorescence of diﬀerent tryptophan residues as a function of time may permit inferences to be made about the folding pathway, and this approach has been used for hen egg white lysozyme, which contains six such residues (346,368,369). Fluorescence energy transfer kinetics have been used to follow the distribution of donor and acceptor labelled residues in cytochrome c as a function of time, and hence to map out an experimental free energy landscape (370).
Detection of folding intermediates can provide important information about pathways, but a combination of techniques may be needed to show that a particular structure is really involved in the folding mechanism (2). In fact, thinking of an intermediate as ‘on’ or ‘oﬀ’ the folding pathway (371,372) may not always be appropriate, since it suggests a one-dimensional picture of the mechanism where every folding path must pass through a particular state. In some cases there will probably be alternative paths for folding, although they will generally correspond to diﬀerent rate constants. A number of potential energy surfaces will be examined in subsequent chapters where relaxation to the global minimum involves both a fast direct component along with slower components; the system ﬁrst explores a kinetic trap and then escapes on a longer time scale. Alternative pathways such as this have been observed for lysozyme (13, 346, 373), where the kinetic heterogeneity is not simply due to isomerisations of the protein backbone, such as cis–trans proline interconversions (361, 374, 375).
New experimental approaches such as electrospray ionisation mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) (376), drift tube measurements, and atomic force microscope (AFM) pulling have already provided new insight into protein folding. For example, electrospray ionisation has been used to investigate the kinetics of folding in lysozyme (376), reactions involving the enzyme xylanase (377), the dynamics of subunit exchange in small heat shock proteins (378), and the structures of intact ribosomes (379) and virus capsids (380). Drift tube ion mobility measurements have been used to investigate the sequential solvation of peptides and proteins in the gas phase, as well as the kinetics of α helix formation (381–389). In AFM pulling experiments a protein is subjected to a time-dependent force, which can be used to unfold it (390–400). It may be possible to construct equilibrium free energy proﬁles from such experiments (401), as well as from laser tweezer stretching (402, 403).

Introduction

The advent of genetic engineering has had a tremendous impact on the study of proteins (2). Using recombinant DNA techniques it is now possible to produce proteins in much larger quantities for experimental investigation. Amino acid sequences can be obtained rapidly from DNA sequences, which can be selectively mutated to alter particular residues of the corresponding protein. The DNA double helix can be cleaved at particular sites using restriction endonuclease enzymes, and appropriate fragments can be rejoined with DNA ligase. The polymerase chain reaction can be used to amplify genetic material; dissociated DNA strands are cooled in the presence of excess oligonucleotides to about 55 ◦C after heating to 94 ◦C. The dissociated strands are then replicated in the presence of a suitable DNA polymerase using the nucleotide substrate material. This process can be repeated using successive heating, cooling and replication steps (2). This ampliﬁcation procedure is a key element in forensic science, enabling individuals to be identiﬁed from small samples of genetic material.
Gene cloning, where a selected DNA sequence is inserted into a vector that replicates autonomously in a suitable host organism, can be used to produce large quantities of the corresponding protein. For example, certain plasmids replicate themselves when introduced into the Escherichia coli bacterium. To obtain a particular protein it is possible to use genome sequence data directly or employ gene libraries where thousands of diﬀerent DNA sequences are cloned into a suitable vector. The library must be screened to see if the required sequence is present (2).
Mutation of a particular amino acid can be achieved using oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis (2). A short oligodeoxynucleotide must be synthesised that is complementary to part of the gene containing the triplet of nucleotides that codes for the amino acid in question. The oligodeoxynucleotide is a correct match for the required sequence of DNA, except for the triplet in question, which is diﬀerent. It is then possible to replicate the rest of the strand and employ the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the required mutant. Random mutagenesis has also been employed in combination with a suitable selection procedure to produce proteins with new and potentially useful properties (2).
Systematic mutation can be used to investigate mechanistic details of how an enzyme functions, and the ﬁrst two systems to be treated in this way were tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (404) and the serine protease subtilisin (2). In this work the shift in the eﬀective binding energy was measured from changes in the rate constant. Structural information may be obtained in a similar way using Φ-value analysis (2, 405, 406). The eﬀect of a mutation on the native,

where the primes denote values for the mutant (Fig. 1.38). If the mutation destabilises the native state much more than the transition state, then Φ = 0; alternatively, if it destabilises the transition state and the native state by the same amount then Φ = 1. Values of zero and unity are therefore associated

Introduction

with residues for which the local environment in the transition state is similar to that of the denatured or native states, respectively.
Fractional Φ values must be interpreted with care (2). They could result from intermediate destabilisation of a relatively uniform transition state ensemble (Section 1.3.6), or they could represent the average over a heterogeneous set of structures. Studies of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), a 64-residue protein, involving more than 100 mutants (407, 408), revealed Φ values typically in the range 0.2 to 0.5. These fractional Φ values have been interpreted in terms of intermediate destabilisation, rather than parallel pathways (409), for a nucleation–condensation (408,410,411) or nucleation– collapse (351, 412) folding mechanism, as discussed in Section 9.3. Experiments on CI2 fragments of increasing size indicate that the α helix does not form until the protein is nearly complete (413, 414). Analysis of this protein therefore suggests that elements of secondary structure are relatively unstable in the absence of long-ranged tertiary interactions (2).
For the small ribonuclease protein barnase, with 110 residues, refolding has been studied from a stable intermediate by measurements on more than 130 mutants (2,405,415,416). In contrast to CI2, where the structure of most regions changes simultaneously on folding and unfolding, diﬀerent parts of barnase exhibit Φ values ranging from zero to unity. The results suggest that the rate-determining step involves docking of a pre-formed α helix and β sheet, which coincides with the formation of a hydrophobic core. The change of folding rates for mutants with metal ion binding sites as a function of metal ion concentration (Ψ-analysis) has also been used to distinguish between sets of pathways that contain common structural elements, and those that are unrelated (417).
Intermediates in protein folding, such as those observed for lysozyme and barnase, could result either from kinetic traps, which slow the folding process, or simply from additional free energy minima along the pathway, which could speed up the reaction (13, 418–421). In either scenario folding is no longer a simple two-state, ﬁrst-order-like transition. Evidence that both types of intermediate may occur (13), depending on the protein, is provided by experimental results for ubiquitin (422) and cytochrome c (423). Changing the balance between entropy and enthalpy can produce a change in behaviour from rapid folding, without an intermediate, to mechanisms involving collapsed intermediate states or traps (13). Experimentally, such eﬀects are achieved by creating mutants with more hydrophobic groups in the core of the protein (422), and in simulations the hydrophobic interaction can simply be changed, or the temperature increased, to reduce the weight of the entropic contribution (424–426). Larger hydrophobic terms increase the

chance that an intermediate free energy minimum will exist, corresponding to a relatively compact state or molten globule.

1.3.3 Levinthal’s paradox
If a protein can be crystallised then the atomic structure may be determined by x-ray crystallography. This analysis generally yields a single, speciﬁc structure, perhaps with some unresolved regions, which may correspond to alternative conﬁgurations. How do we know that this x-ray structure has any connection with the native state (or set of states (356,427)) in solution? The answer comes from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which generally reveals that the structure is essentially the same as for the crystal. Solution structures are deduced indirectly using distance constraints derived from the nuclear Overhauser eﬀect (NOE). Strong, intermediate and weak NOE interactions for 1H atoms generally mean that the two nuclei are separated by less than 2.5 ˚A, 3.5 ˚A, and 5 ˚A, respectively. Resonances are ﬁrst assigned to particular protons, making use of the observed chemical shifts and ﬁne structure due to through-bond spin–spin coupling between nuclei. NOE constraints are then applied to discover which protons are close in space. NMR experiments also reveal that the protein structure is not static, and that a number of closely related conﬁgurations may be sampled in solution (319). The resolution aﬀorded by NMR decreases for larger systems, even when other nuclei such as 15N and 13C are probed and multidimensional techniques are used. However, for proteins that have not yet been crystallised successfully, i.e. the majority, it remains the most useful technique available, and has also been used to study folding in real time (428–430).
Levinthal ﬁrst recognised in 1969 that the location of speciﬁc folded structures for a protein must involve a search that potentially involves an exponentially large number of local minima (16). Around this time the ﬁrst attempts were also being made to predict the folded structure of a protein from its sequence alone. Anﬁnsen had shown that some denatured proteins, such as ribonuclease A and staphylococcal nuclease, could be folded and denatured repeatedly in the laboratory (17, 431, 432). Levinthal noted that a protein with r amino acid residues, each of which can adopt n stable conﬁgurations, would probably have around nr local minima. If minima are sampled on the fastest possible time scale, corresponding to a typical vibrational period of 10−12 s, the time taken to search through all the conﬁgurations is enormous compared to the observed folding times of less than a second, even for the modest values of r = 100 and n = 2. This discrepancy is Levinthal’s

Introduction

‘paradox’. A more detailed analysis suggests that the number of local minima on a potential energy surface will generally scale exponentially with the system size (Section 5.1).
Anﬁnsen’s ‘thermodynamic principle’ (9, 432) holds that the native state of a protein is the most favourable in thermodynamic terms, so that protein folding corresponds to an overall reduction in free energy. In fact some exceptions are known (433, 434), such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, where the active state converts to an inactive form (presumably with lower free energy) on a time scale of hours (435). Recently it has become apparent that alternative structures can also be formed by the aggregation of many polypeptide chains into ﬁbrils (or plaques), which are based on β sheet-type packing. Understanding the formation and structure of these aggregates is now an active area of research due to possible connections with a variety of prion diseases (436–439) and inherited traits (440, 441). It is now known that amyloid can be formed by many diﬀerent proteins under suitable conditions (437, 442, 443). In prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeld–Jakob disease, the actual disease mechanism may be a self-propagating conformational change in the prion protein PrP, whose cellular function is unknown (444). Although inherited prion diseases, such as fatal familial insomnia, have been linked to mutations in PrP, a detailed understanding of these diseases is still lacking (445). A number of post-translational modiﬁcation and cellular transport processes are probably involved (444,446,447). However, it is clear that conversion of PrP from a mostly α-helical to a β-sheet structure is an essential step in prion propagation. Several noninfectious diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s have also been linked to the aggregation of misfolded proteins (437, 438).
Unassisted refolding can generally be observed for relatively small water soluble globular proteins with less than about three hundred residues. Exceptions may arise for proteins that are chemically modiﬁed after biosynthesis, such as insulin and chymotrypsin, where internal segments are removed by proteolysis. For larger proteins, especially those belonging to higher organisms, spontaneous refolding does not usually occur in vitro (448, 449). Between 10 and 15% of proteins require the participation of molecular chaperones to assist the folding process. These complexes are found throughout the cytosol of a cell, as well as in various subcellular compartments delimited by membranes (450–458). Diﬀerent classes of chaperone play a role in protein folding, preventing misfolding and aggregation, and stabilising unfolded polypeptides for the process of translocation across membranes (451, 459–463).

1.3 Proteins

The chaperones belonging to families known as Hsp60 and Hsp70 (heatshock proteins) assist folding by binding, releasing and rebinding proteins that have not yet reached their native state (448). They achieve this task by binding sequences of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains, which are no longer exposed when the protein has folded correctly. The functioning of some of these chaperones is quite well understood, especially two members of the Hsp10 and Hsp60 family in the Escherichia coli bacterium, where they form the chaperonin complexes GroES and GroEL, respectively. GroEL consists of 14 subunits, each containing 547 amino acids, arranged into two seven-membered rings that stack one on top of the other to leave a central channel where substrate proteins bind. The mass of each subunit is about 60 000 atomic mass units or daltons, sometimes written as 60 kDa; hence the name of the family, Hsp60. GroES binds to one end of the cylinder, closing it oﬀ and inducing a conformational change in GroEL that reduces the aﬃnity of the remaining open end for GroES (319).
Experimentally, globular proteins are only marginally stable in their folded state (2,319). Small changes in pH or temperature can cause the biologically active native state to be denatured into an inactive unfolded form, and the free energy diﬀerence between these states may be only 20−60 kJ/mol, the equivalent of a few hydrogen-bonds. In terms of the ﬁrst-order phase change picture of two-state folding, discussed below, the near cancellation of entropy and enthalpy might suggest that the system is near a critical point (464). Such entropy–enthalpy compensation is actually quite a common phenomenon (465, 466). Denaturing is usually achieved either by raising the temperature, changing the pH, increasing the pressure, or using a chemical agent such as guanidinium chloride.
Under some conditions it is likely that both the folded and unfolded states constitute local free energy minima, with a barrier between them. To distinguish the two forms we require an order parameter , say Q, which has diﬀerent values in the two regions of conﬁguration space. Q may also serve as a reaction coordinate that tells us how far along the folding pathway any given conﬁguration lies (Section 6.6.3). Plotting the free energy as a function of Q will then reveal whether two minima exist at the folded and unfolded extremes, and the height of the barrier that separates them. The folding process can then be viewed as a competition between entropy and potential energy or enthalpy, with the low enthalpy, low entropy state favoured at low temperature, and the high entropy, high enthalpy state favoured at high temperature. Under physiological conditions the balance lies just in favour of the folded state, if there is indeed more than one free energy minimum. This situation corresponds to the ﬁnite system analogue of a

Introduction

ﬁrst-order phase change (467), like the freezing or melting transition in a cluster. The characteristics of such ﬁnite size transitions are discussed in detail in Section 8.1.
An obvious question is why evolution has led to folded proteins that are only marginally stable, and the answer probably lies in the necessity for regulation. The required quantity of any given protein in a living cell varies over time, and so it is necessary to degrade proteins and remove them, as well as synthesise and fold them. In fact there is quite a rapid turnover of globular proteins in a living cell (319). Changes of conformation are also commonly required for proteins to perform their required functions, and so some structural ﬂexibility is clearly necessary. There is also some evidence for a balance between stability and activity (2, 468, 469), especially in the active site of an enzyme.
Unfolded proteins have greater conformational freedom, while the native structure has lower internal energy because of favourable non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen-bonds, Coulombic attraction between polar groups carrying opposite charges, and dispersion forces between neutral electronic distributions. However, the situation for a protein in an aqueous environment is more complicated, because we must also consider the entropy and enthalpy changes of the solvent. For example, whilst intramolecular hydrogen-bonding is maximised in the folded state, hydrogen-bonding between the NH and CO groups of the protein and water molecules is maximised for unfolded conﬁgurations. The T ∆S and ∆H changes between the two states amount to hundreds of kJ/mol, but largely cancel out under physiological conditions to produce the relatively small free energy diﬀerence ∆G = ∆H − T ∆S.
Of course, thermodynamics is just one aspect of the problem, for it is often possible to characterise systems that are not in their most favourable thermodynamic state but instead occupy a locally stable state, perhaps over very long time scales. Glasses provide an obvious example, as discussed in Section 1.4. In order for the thermodynamically favourable state of a protein to perform a useful biological function it must also be kinetically accessible. Some molecular chaperones also prevent aggregation of intermediate conﬁgurations with exposed hydrophobic groups, or the formation of incorrect disulphide bridges or incorrect proline conﬁgurations, which might otherwise present kinetic traps.

1.3.4 Hydrophobic collapse
At a coarse-grained level, the folding of many (but not all) proteins can be described in terms of a rapid collapse from the extended unfolded state

into a partly organised molten globule, which contains some of the correct secondary structure, but little tertiary structure (319). Direct evidence for such collapse has been inferred from ﬂuorescence studies of various proteins (13,470) and small-angle x-ray scattering studies of myoglobin (471). Experimental results for α-lactalbumin suggest that the collapsed state contains a signiﬁcant amount of secondary structure (472,473), some of it native-like (418, 474), before the structure compacts further on forming native tertiary interactions. Collapse to a molten globule state may require only milliseconds, and the remaining steps that lead to a more compact native state may take up to a second. If the molten globule state is another local free energy minimum then a further free energy barrier must also be surmounted.
The thermodynamic driving force that leads to the native state is often described in terms of the hydrophobic eﬀect and the burial of hydrophobic side chains in the core of the protein (475–479). This eﬀect was recognised as soon as the detailed x-ray structure of myoglobin became available (328,329). Using NMR spectroscopy a network of hydrophobic clusters stabilised by cooperative, long-ranged interactions with a particular tryptophan residue has been revealed in the unfolded state of hen lysozyme (368, 369).
Although the hydrophobic nature of many nonpolar molecules is quite obvious from the way they fail to mix with water in bulk, the precise details of the balance between entropy and enthalpy that cause this nonmixing are still an active area of research (480–490), and several models have been proposed (483, 488, 491–495). The free energy barrier to transferring small hydrocarbon molecules, such as benzene and hexane, from their own bulk liquid phase into water at 298 K is largely entropic in origin (496). The T ∆S term is typically more than ten times greater in magnitude than ∆H, and is consistently unfavourable, whereas ∆H usually amounts to only one or two kJ/mol and can be positive or negative (496). However, the heat capacity change for the same process, ∆C, is relatively large and generally positive, so that the entropy change for solvation in water becomes more favourable, but the enthalpy change less favourable, as the temperature rises.
Water is a relatively structured liquid, as evidenced by a narrow ﬁrst peak in the oxygen–oxygen pair correlation function and a relatively large entropy of vaporisation (497). The large negative entropy change that constitutes most of the hydrophobic eﬀect at room temperature is probably due to further ordering of water molecules around hydrophobic solutes (498–500). The most extreme example of this ordering occurs in gas hydrates, where water molecules form polyhedral cages, each containing a single hydrocarbon molecule, such as methane. These clathrate compounds can solidify and block gas pipelines.

Introduction

Since a hydrophobic solute cannot form hydrogen-bonds with the ﬁrst solvation shell of water molecules, there are fewer favourable orientations for molecules in this layer compared with the bulk. When the temperature increases some of the less favourable orientations with fewer or weaker hydrogen-bonds in the ﬁrst solvation shell become more accessible, which contributes to the heat capacity of the system. This ‘iceberg’ model (498) also suggests that the small contribution of ∆H to the hydrophobic eﬀect at room temperature may arise because the hydrogen-bonds within the ﬁrst solvation shell are relatively strong. Here the ‘iceberg’ refers to the comparatively ordered and tightly bound ﬁrst solvation shell. Support for such ideas comes from the experimental observation that ∆S, ∆H and ∆C for the solvation of hydrophobic molecules in water are roughly proportional to the surface area (500).
The overall thermodynamics of protein folding is obtained by combining the contributions expected from the hydrophobic eﬀect with the additional terms that result from internal entropy and enthalpy changes of the protein. The increased entropy of the solvent from the hydrophobic eﬀect is outweighed by the loss in conformational entropy of the protein, and so ∆S for folding is negative. The packing of side chains in the folded state is enthalpically favourable, and so ∆H for folding is also negative. Since the heat capacity change on folding, ∆C, is large and negative, as expected from the hydrophobic contribution, both ∆S and ∆H for folding decrease with increasing temperature. If ∆C is temperature independent then ∆S and ∆H decrease as ∆C ln T and T ∆C, respectively. Since they change at diﬀerent rates the free energy diﬀerence exhibits a minimum value (for ∆C < 0) of ∆H(T0) + T0∆C(exp(−∆S(T0)/∆C) − 1) at T = T0 exp(−∆S(T0)/∆C), where T0 is a reference temperature. Both heating and cooling can therefore lead to denaturation if the system moves suﬃciently far from the temperature at which the folded state corresponds to a minimum in ∆G. Denaturation on heating is a well-known phenomenon, and cold denaturation can also be achieved for some proteins (501), especially in the presence of the chemical denaturant urea.
Empirically, most of the variation in the thermodynamics of protein unfolding has been shown to correlate with the buried surface area (502). Structural information can then be inferred about the folding pathway from a series of equilibrium experiments with varying concentrations of denaturant, if we assume that the free energy change is proportional to the area of the hydrophobic region that is solvent accessible (2, 503). However, this assumption should only be considered as a ﬁrst approximation.

Solvent separated hydrophobic molecules can also be stable (494, 504–508), but this eﬀect usually occurs only for small solutes (509).
The denaturant guanidinium chloride is generally found to lower the barrier to unfolding, and raise the barrier to folding, as an almost linear function of concentration. The eﬀective rate constants for folding and unfolding, kf and ku, are expected to depend exponentially on the corresponding barriers, and hence ln kf and ln ku will depend linearly on the denaturant concentration with positive and negative coeﬃcients, respectively. Simple two-state dynamics is associated with exponential decay towards equilibrium with an overall rate that is the sum of the forward and backward rates (Section 7.2.3 and equation (6.80) in Section 6.6.3). For high and low concentrations of denaturant, [d], this decay rate, kobs, will be dominated by ku and kf , respectively, and ln kobs will vary linearly with [d], but with negative and positive slopes. The overall result is a V-shaped or ‘chevron’ plot.
Folding and unfolding transitions are also sometimes described as ‘cooperative’ and ‘all-or-none’ (449). Here, the term ‘cooperative’ refers to an abrupt change in some observable property (449, 467, 500) such as the populations of two states, A and B, as a function of an external parameter such as temperature, while an ‘all-or-none’ change refers to the ﬁnite system analogue of a ﬁrst-order phase transition (Section 8.1). A simple model may help to illustrate these eﬀects, which can result from competition between entropy and enthalpy. Consider a system with n sites, nA of which are in state A and nB in state B, where nA + nB = n. Let the contribution of each site in state A to the potential energy be − − γnA/n and the contribution of each B state be zero, and let each B state have m alternative substates with the same energy. Hence the system can maximise its entropy if nB is large, or minimise its potential energy if nA is large. Cooperativity arises from the energetic term in γ, which couples the energy of each site in state A to the mean occupation of this state, nA/n, and leads to a quadratic term in the total internal energy, E. The entropy and the internal energy are

We can now deﬁne a free energy, A(T, nA), as a function of temperature and the order parameter nA, as described in Section 6.5.1 and Section 8.1.
Some results for this model are shown in Fig. 1.39. For γ = 1 the free

As the cooperativity is decreased to γ = 0.8 all these features become less pronounced, and for γ = 0 all the changes become smooth and A(T, nA) exhibits only a single minimum as a function of nA over the full temperature range. This model therefore illustrates how the ﬁnite system analogue of a ﬁrst-order phase change may arise from cooperativity in the balance between entropy and potential energy. More sophisticated

theories of helix to coil transitions in polymers also incorporate the notion of cooperativity (510–513). However, since there is a continuous spectrum of behaviour in the observable properties of a ﬁnite system it may be diﬃcult to determine experimentally whether there is a double minimum in the free energy (514, 515).

1.3.5 Nucleation
In fact, the formation of magic number clusters and crystals also involves searches through exponentially large numbers of local minima, and statistically such events are at least as impressive as the folding of a protein (9, 516, 517). Furthermore, the identiﬁcation of protein folding with the ﬁnite analogue of a ﬁrst-order phase change, involving competition between entropy and enthalpy, suggests that Levinthal’s paradox might be overcome in the same manner as for clusters and crystals. For a bulk system, the free energy diﬀerence between solid and liquid phases must scale extensively with the system size, but the same cannot be true of the barrier between the phases, or freezing and melting would be impossible. Instead, a nucleation and growth model applies (518–521): a ﬁnite nucleus of the new phase is ﬁrst formed, and as it grows the free energy initially rises. However, if growth continues until a critical nucleus is reached then the free energy achieves a local maximum, and further growth then leads downhill to the new phase. This scenario corresponds to the existence of a double free energy minimum, as for the simple model examined above. Some alternative free energy proﬁles are discussed in terms of the random energy model in Section 9.4.
When a solid phase crystallises from a bulk liquid the critical nucleus can initially start to grow anywhere, since the liquid is homogeneous on average. If crystallisation occurs from more than one centre then a polycrystalline material is formed. Since ﬁnite systems, such as clusters, polymers (522) or proteins, are not homogeneous, it is likely that a nucleation-and-growth-type mechanism would preferentially involve atoms or amino acids in particular spatial locations.
How does a nucleation mechanism avoid the Levinthal paradox? An exponentially large number of local minima are associated with the conﬁgurations of a denatured protein or the liquid-like phase of a cluster. The initial ensemble of paths that lead to the alternative free energy minimum must also involve an exponential number of states, or the Levinthal paradox would apply. A critical nucleus, or free energy transition state, corresponding to a barrier that scales intensively with system size, must involve restrictions on

Introduction

a ﬁnite number of atoms. If the remaining degrees of freedom are essentially unrestricted then the number of states associated with these coordinates will also be exponential, and the search for the start of the nucleation path is tractable. As the nucleus grows the entropy associated with this region continues to fall, but stronger interactions lead to a favourable decrease in enthalpy. Further growth from the critical nucleus leads to a decrease in free energy because the enthalpy falls faster than the entropy.

1.3.6 Energy landscape theories
It is generally recognised that the ﬂaw in Levinthal’s original analysis is to regard the search through conformational space as random, which corresponds to a ﬂat potential or free energy surface. However, the introduction of an energy bias towards the native state has a profound eﬀect upon the kinetics, and can reduce the relaxation time scale to a realistic value in simple models (516, 523, 524).
Potential and free energy surfaces that are biased towards the global minimum are obtained in a variety of theoretical frameworks. One approach, based on ideas from spin glass theory and a random energy model (REM), employs the concept of minimal frustration, as discussed in Section 9.4. Although naturally occurring proteins can fold to a well-deﬁned native state, artiﬁcial proteins composed of random amino acid sequences are not expected to (4, 525–529), because there is no structure in which a majority of the possible favourable interactions can occur at the same time. Bryngelson et al. suggested that naturally occurring proteins have evolved to minimise such frustration as far as possible (9), and so the native state is a low-lying free energy minimum. This idea is similar to the ‘harmony principle’, which was proposed on the basis of simulations (530, 531).
The presence of a well-deﬁned free energy minimum for the native state is not in itself suﬃcient for a protein to fold eﬃciently, since the minimum must also be kinetically accessible (4, 516, 532). Leopold et al. proposed that the native state of a naturally occurring protein may correspond to the terminus of a collection of convergent kinetic pathways, and envisaged a ‘folding funnel’ where the free energy decreases systematically in the vicinity of the target structure (7). Eﬃcient folding also requires the absence of local free energy minima that would act as kinetic traps and prevent relaxation to the native state (516). The free energy folding funnel concept has been developed in a number of further studies (8–10, 356, 426, 464, 533–538). One particular schematic view of a folding funnel based upon a minimalist

lattice model is shown in Fig. 1.40 (3, 7, 8). The lattice representations in question do not involve explicit solvent, and so the (horizontal) entropy and (vertical) potential energy (or enthalpy) correspond directly to conﬁgurations of the model. To extend this picture to a solvated protein the entropy and potential energy coordinates can be interpreted as the internal entropy of the protein alone and a solvent-averaged potential energy (or enthalpy) (11, 539), which must implicitly include hydrophobic eﬀects. Local minima in the envelope of the funnel represent possible traps (7–9, 464), and a local free energy minimum corresponding to a disordered globule state was indeed observed for one lattice model that inspired the picture in Fig. 1.40 (8). However, the path to the global free energy minimum was essentially downhill once the system passed the transition state (540), as in a simple nucleation picture.
Of course, it is not feasible to represent all the subtleties or diversities of free or potential energy surfaces in such a ﬁgure (11, 539). It is also important to realise that the detailed local structure of a free energy surface

Introduction

calculated as a function of a few order parameters may not be physically meaningful. For example, a localised barrier that appears in one coordinate might disappear if the deﬁnition of the order parameter were changed slightly. It is gross features such as well-deﬁned double minima separated by a signiﬁcant barrier that are likely to be realistic. Local free energy minima may certainly exist, but they are unlikely all to be representable in terms of the same global order parameters. Instead we could start from the underlying potential energy surface before any averaging is performed, and consider each local minimum as a possible trap. A model that starts from this viewpoint is described in Section 10.5.
Various alternatives for representing and coarse-graining a PES are considered in Chapter 5. In particular, potential energy surfaces that correspond to convergent kinetic pathways have been visualised for a number of systems, and provide well-deﬁned examples where the corresponding free energy surface is expected to have ‘focusing’ or ‘funnelling’ properties.
For an ‘ideal’ system, where all the native interactions are attractive and equally strong, the energy of any conﬁguration would be proportional to the number of native contacts (538). There would be no frustrated interactions and no possibility of trapping behind an energetic barrier, although a free energy barrier based on entropy could still exist between ordered and disordered local minima. The ideal funnel limit has therefore been associated with a completely uniform distribution of Φ values in the transition state ensemble (538, 541). It is important to realise that this picture does not require all the interactions to be of comparable strength in every transition state conﬁguration, for this would suggest a barrier height that grows extensively with system size. Instead, the uniform distribution associated with an ideal system refers to an average over all the members of the transition state ensemble.
As a corollary of the ideal funnel model, nonuniform Φ values for the transition state ensemble have been associated with increasing energetic frustration and additional local free energy minima, as well as increasing restrictions and speciﬁcity for the conﬁgurations that make up the transition state ensemble (541). However, for ﬁnite heterogeneous systems such as real proteins, some speciﬁc interactions are probably inevitable in the transition state conﬁgurations, and nonuniform Φ-value distributions will result (538).
The notion of a funnelling landscape composed of a set of convergent kinetic pathways has also been used to extend the funnel picture to potential energy surfaces (Section 5.3) (516, 542, 543). Regions of the PES have been identiﬁed for a number of systems where pathways to the lowest potential

energy minimum involve only local minima with monotonically decreasing potential energies and relatively low potential energy barriers. Rapid relaxation to minima with lower potential energy occurs within such a structure over a wide range of temperature, as illustrated for a number of examples in following chapters. The higher resolution aﬀorded by direct analysis of the PES therefore allows regions of conﬁguration space with locally ‘funnelling’ properties to be identiﬁed even for glassy landscapes, where many such features compete to trap the system (Section 5.3).
One way to incorporate both kinetic and thermodynamic considerations into a theoretical analysis is to deﬁne a folding temperature, Tf , below which the native state becomes the global free energy minimum, and a temperature, Tg, where the kinetics become slower than some observation time (534, 544). Tg is often referred to as a ‘glass transition’ temperature, since below this point the system is unlikely to escape from a local trap on the time scale in question. However, it is important to remember that natural proteins have probably evolved to reduce the possibility of trapping, although some relaxational behaviour has been interpreted in terms of ‘glassy’ dynamics (Section 1.4.2). In contrast, for good glass formers trapping is a virtual certainty (Section 1.4.1), due to the presence of many local free energy minima that diﬀer from the global potential energy minimum, all separated by signiﬁcant barriers (545–548). Folding is expected to be most eﬃcient when the ratio Tf /Tg is large, for then the native state has a signiﬁcant occupation probability at temperatures where it is still kinetically accessible (4, 532, 549, 550). This situation may also correspond to ‘minimal frustration’ (4, 5), as discussed in Section 9.4. An alternative suggestion is that Tg should be compared to the collapse temperature, rather than to Tf (551).
The description of protein folding suggested by some lattice model simulations (Section 9.3) (552, 553) has been referred to as a ‘new view’ (554). In this context the ‘old view’ was described in terms of ‘an analogy between protein folding and an ordinary chemical reaction that has a deﬁned series of intermediates and a single rate-limiting step’ (554). A contrast was therefore made between the single pathway of this ‘old view’ (344, 555–557) and the multiple pathways found for lattice models. As noted above, simple considerations of the entropy and potential energy, as exempliﬁed by a nucleation model, also indicate that the number of possible starting points for folding must scale exponentially with system size, otherwise the Levinthal paradox would apply. Multiple pathways are also implicit or explicit in other treatments of free energy landscapes (5, 9, 516, 531, 538, 558–560), and in the notion of a folding funnel as a set of kinetically convergent pathways (7).

Introduction

One way to think about the ‘old’ and ‘new’ views simply corresponds to recognising the increasing complexity of the potential energy surface that is associated with systems containing many degrees of freedom. For small molecules the local minima and transition states of the PES may correspond closely to minima and transition states of the free energy, but in a large system some processes must be described in terms of ensembles of structures (Section 4.1, Section 6.6.3, Section 7.5) (9, 13, 538, 539, 561). The correspondence between the ‘structure’ associated with minima and transition states of the free energy and single stationary points of the potential energy is then broken, but if we permit the states to be formed from a superposition of local potential energy minima (Section 7.1) then results such as the twostate picture with simple exponential dynamics are recovered, if appropriate. We can also continue to speak of a reaction pathway if we simply extend the deﬁnition to include an ensemble of paths, which all lead to some given free energy minimum (562).
The theoretical methods required to treat the ensembles of structures and pathways that are encountered in large clusters, proteins and glasses, are necessarily founded on statistical treatments. Interpretations of protein folding involving the random energy model (4–9, 11) (Section 9.4), and approaches based directly on stationary points of the PES, such as the superposition approximation (for thermodynamics, Section 7.1) and discrete path sampling (for dynamics, Section 7.5), are examples of such ‘energy landscape theories’. Of course, only one structure or pathway is encountered at a time experimentally; statistical theories involve the probability distribution for this sampling of the free or potential energy surface. As emphasised above, it is still possible to describe the system in terms of ensembles corresponding to free energy minima and pathways. To determine whether relaxation occurs via distinct pathways then requires a more subjective criterion to deﬁne what is meant by ‘distinct’. One way to do this is to group together paths corresponding to transition state conﬁgurations that share certain elements of structure, but ambiguities may arise in practice. Real systems have no obligation to exhibit behaviour that falls into convenient, well-deﬁned categories.

1.4 Glasses and supercooled liquids
Many liquids fail to crystallise on cooling through the melting temperature of the crystal at Tm (563, 564), and the resulting supercooled liquid may be metastable with respect to the crystal over long time scales. As the temperature falls the viscosity continues to rise, and the relaxation time associated

with a variety of observable properties increases. Depending on the time scale of observation, a temperature is ﬁnally reached at which the system is properly described as a noncrystalline solid, or glass (521, 547, 565–577).
Questions of equilibrium, nonergodicity and metastability are key issues in this area, and it is important to deﬁne what they mean. The association of equilibrium with a state that is unchanging over a particular observation time scale is especially important, as discussed by Ma (578). For example, an old painting hanging on a wall can reasonably be said to exist in an equilibrium state over a short time scale of a few seconds, or even days (578). However, over a period of hundreds of years the pigments will oxidise, the hanger may deform, and the wall may fall down. Only an idealised state can be thought of as in equilibrium over an inﬁnite time scale. Equilibrium is also a macroscopic concept, and refers to length and time scales that are much larger than those that characterise individual atomic motion, such as vibration. Equilibrium is therefore characterised by average values of physical quantities that do not change within the observation time. A supercooled liquid can therefore be viewed as an equilibrium state in both experiments and simulations if such averages are unchanging. However, below the melting point of the crystal the liquid phase has a higher free energy, and is therefore said to be metastable. For systems where the melting point is unknown it is still possible to identify a supercooled regime from characteristic anomalies such as deviation from Arrhenius behaviour.
One deﬁnition of ergodicity is that ensemble averages and time averages should give the same result. For a system in a metastable state the equilibrium averages on the given time scale will not agree with an average taken over the whole of phase space. However, if the phase space average is restricted to the relevant region of phase space then the results can once again agree. It may therefore be helpful to think of a supercooled liquid in terms of a locally ergodic equilibrium for a certain time scale and region of phase space. The dependence of the experimentally observed glass transition upon factors such as cooling rate is symptomatic of a breakdown in equilibrium and ergodicity even within the phase space corresponding to disordered structures. Below the glass transition, equilibrium on the experimental time scale corresponds to a more restricted region of phase space, and this region depends on details of the experiment, since trapping may occur into any of an exponentially large number of similar states.
Elliott has suggested the following deﬁnitions in relation to the study of glasses (565). An amorphous material is one that lacks the long-range order of a crystal, and a solid is simply deﬁned as a material with a shear viscosity in excess of 1013.6 Ns/m2, which corresponds to a relaxation time of one

Introduction

day (565). Alternative thresholds in the viscosity around this value are also used (572). A glass can then be deﬁned as an amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition, where derivative thermodynamic properties such as the heat capacity change abruptly (565). The rapid decrease in the heat capacity from liquid-like to crystal-like values is an important experimental signature of this phenomenon (572). However, variation in such properties with factors such as the cooling rate highlights the problem that this experimental transition does not correspond to equilibrium, but rather to trapping in a noncrystalline region of conﬁguration space on the experimental time scale.

1.4.1 Glasses and the potential energy surface
As mentioned in Section 1, it was Goldstein who ﬁrst pointed out that the properties of a glass are all derived ultimately from the underlying potential energy surface (18), although Gibbs also associated glassy behaviour with a decrease in the number of accessible potential energy minima on the PES (579). From this point of view the formation of a structural glass corresponds to trapping in a region of conﬁguration space that is distinct from the crystal. Here we immediately separate structural glasses from spin glasses, which correspond to systems with spin degrees of freedom distributed over ﬁxed sites, where the low temperature state is disordered (546, 548). Experimentally, spin glasses may be formed from dilute solutions of magnetic transition metal atoms as impurities in an otherwise magnetically inactive host metal. As the name suggests, spin glasses may exhibit many properties that are analogous to those of structural glasses. However, spin glass phases are generally a consequence of ﬁxed, randomly chosen interaction parameters between sites in the Hamiltonian, and this ‘quenched disorder’ is somewhat diﬀerent from the situation in a structural glass. In fact models have been proposed that generate randomness internally (580–582). Nevertheless, since the main focus of the present book is upon the role of the potential energy surface considered as a continuous function of atomic coordinates, it is structural glasses that are of primary interest.
Goldstein realised that at low enough temperature it should be possible to separate the fast motion corresponding to vibrations around a local minimum from the slower jumps over potential energy barriers that separate diﬀerent minima (18). The fast vibrational motion is sometimes referred to as the ‘microscopic process’ or ‘cage-rattling’ from its appearance in modecoupling theory (Section 10.1.4) (583). However, at higher temperature the system will generally be able to cross potential barriers so rapidly that equilibration within each local minimum does not occur.

Identifying glass formation with trapping on the PES enables comparisons to be made with ﬁnite systems such as clusters and proteins, where kinetic traps usually correspond to competing morphologies (Section 5.3). If the thermodynamic properties associated with these competing structures are suﬃciently diﬀerent then we expect to see the ﬁnite system analogue of a ﬁrst-order phase transition, as discussed in Section 8.1, with rounded discontinuities in properties such as the internal energy. On supercooling a liquid, however, the conﬁguration space associated with the crystal, if it exists, becomes kinetically inaccessible, and the ﬁrst-order freezing transition is avoided. On further cooling the system eventually becomes kinetically trapped in a disordered state. In general there will be an exponentially large number of disordered states to choose from, all with similar thermodynamic properties, and so if a phase transition can be identiﬁed it is not expected to be ﬁrst-order (Section 10.5) (584). In this sense the glass transition is fundamentally diﬀerent from a ﬁrst-order transition to an alternative, metastable crystal, or from trapping in the icosahedral region of conﬁguration space for the LJ38 cluster (Section 8.3.5). The PES in the region of conﬁguration space corresponding to disordered local minima will not have the funnelling characteristics expected in the region of a low energy crystal. Instead there will be a large number of disordered minima with very similar energies, even at the lower bound of the distribution of amorphous minima.
Even if the glass transition corresponds to an underlying phase transition, which is a subject of debate (Section 10.1.1) (547), the experimentally observed glass transition that occurs on cooling is governed by kinetics (572,575). Free volume theory (Section 10.1.3) predicts that the dependence of the experimental Tg on the cooling rate, q, is (585)

(1.6)

where C is a constant of order 3 × 10−5 K, and q0 varies over many orders of magnitude for diﬀerent systems (565). Typical cooling rates for good glass formers are of order 0.01 K/s, but far higher rates can now be achieved, and have led to the characterisation of new materials such as metallic glasses (Section 1.4.2). As a rule of thumb, Tg is often found to be about 2Tm/3 when it is deﬁned experimentally as the temperature at which the heat capacity starts to increase rapidly on heating in diﬀerential scanning calorimetry or diﬀerential thermal analysis experiments (572).
Two main areas of study can be distinguished in terms of understanding the role of the PES in glasses. First, there is the question of why some materials, such as TiO2 and Al2O3, are diﬃcult to obtain in a glassy state

Introduction

(586), while others, such as SiO2 and B2O3, readily form glasses. As noted in Section 1 and Section 1.3.5, the location of an ordered crystalline state from an exponentially large number of disordered alternatives can also be viewed as a ‘paradox’ (9, 516, 517). In one sense the paradox is resolved by a simple nucleation and growth model, but the application of homogeneous nucleation theory to predict minimum cooling rates for glass formation is not straightforward (547), and a more fundamental understanding in terms of the geometry of the PES is also desirable. The second main line of research is how some characteristic properties of glasses (577, 587, 588), such as deviations from the Arrhenius law, ‘stretched exponential’ relaxation, and excess low frequency vibrational states, arise from the PES.
Computer simulations of glassy systems may be complicated by the need to obtain well-deﬁned averages that correspond to local rather than global ergodic sampling. Furthermore, some of the properties that are measured experimentally, such as dielectric relaxation in systems composed of relatively complicated molecules, are diﬃcult to obtain in simulations. The large system sizes required to represent a bulk material, and the complicated intermolecular forces between molecules that possess important intramolecular degrees of freedom represent a signiﬁcant challenge. The accessible time scales in conventional simulations also make the glass transition a less welldeﬁned process (572, 589, 590), although in compensation, crystallisation is unlikely to be observed. Nevertheless, signiﬁcant insights have been obtained from simulations of simple atomic glass formers, and analysis of the corresponding potential energy surfaces.
As described in Section 7.1, attempts to describe thermodynamic properties in terms of contributions from local minima of the PES date back at least to early cluster studies of homogeneous nucleation. The extension of this approach to dynamical properties, using transitions between local minima, enabled Stillinger and Weber to provide a direct realisation of Goldstein’s separation of local vibrational motion and slower rearrangements corresponding to the crossing of potential energy barriers (18). In this context the local minima were referred to as ‘inherent structures’ to reﬂect the fact that there is always a potential energy surface underlying the dynamics, even though it may be obscured by vibrational motion (19, 20). The transition rates were also found to exhibit appropriate scaling with system size (591).
One of the most popular models for simulation studies is a binary LennardJones system containing two diﬀerent types of atom, which is described in more detail in Section 10.2. Molecular dynamics results corresponding to ergodic sampling of the glassy conﬁguration space have been used to test

the predictions of mode-coupling theory (MCT) (Section 10.1.4) for this system (593–595). Some of these results appear to complement studies of the underlying PES, since they suggest that potential energy barriers start to have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the dynamics below a temperature of about 0.9 reduced units (596). Analysis of the average energy of local minima sampled in cooling trajectories for the same system shows that lower energies are achieved for slower cooling rates (592, 597), as expected, and similar results have been obtained for silica (598). Relaxation was also monitored in terms of the autocorrelation function for atomic positions. At high temperature there is relatively little variation in the potential energy of the local minima that are sampled. However, below a temperature of around 0.9 the average potential energy of the minima starts to fall (Fig. 1.41). Relaxation also becomes nonexponential below this temperature, as expected for fragile glass formers (Section 1.4.3), and the system enters a ‘landscape inﬂuenced’ regime (592). On further cooling the system reaches a low temperature plateau, the ‘landscape dominated regime’ which sinks to lower

Introduction

energy for slower cooling rates, and corresponds to a breakdown in equilibrium for the conﬁguration space corresponding to disordered structures on the MD time scale. Structural changes on cooling were previously identiﬁed in a monatomic model glass former, where increasing icosahedral order appeared at lower temperatures (599).
The above results are consistent with the thermal sampling of a roughly Gaussian distribution of energies for the local minima (Section 5.1) (600– 603). A ﬁrst approximation to the most likely value of the energy for a Gaussian probability distribution with mean value µ and standard deviation σ at temperature T is µ − σ2/kT (Section 9.4), which tends to µ as T → ∞. For ﬁnite cooling rates the system simply appears frozen lower down the PES, in agreement with calculations based on a model PES (Section 10.5) (603).
A roughly Gaussian distribution for the energy density of the local minima, and other stationary points (603), is the likely outcome of applying the central limit theorem to any model problem (604). For example, describing the conﬁgurational excitations of amorphous systems in terms of a bond lattice model containing broken and unbroken bonds (605) enables thermodynamic properties to be calculated if the excitations are treated as noninteracting (587). This model has two parameters, namely the excitation energy and entropy, and can reproduce the simulation results in Fig. 1.41 quite well when these values are chosen appropriately (587). However, the behaviour of the predicted heat capacity does not seem to agree with experiment (587). The variation in the potential energy of local minima sampled at diﬀerent temperatures illustrated in Fig. 1.41 can also be ﬁtted by another two-state type model (606).
Detailed studies of the elementary rearrangement mechanisms and the corresponding barrier height distributions have been presented for binary Lennard-Jones and other model glass formers (607, 608). These results suggest that a wide spectrum of barriers exist, ranging from processes where one or more atoms change their nearest-neighbour coordination shell to mechanisms where all the nearest neighbours remain the same. The latter mechanisms, which generally have low barriers, suggest that diﬀerent local minima can still be accessed at temperatures below the glass transition, so that the entropy still contains contributions from more than one local minimum, as well as from vibrational degrees of freedom (Section 10.5). The resulting picture appears consistent with Angell’s view of the glass transition as the temperature where structural relaxation, involving diﬀusive motion via escape from nearest-neighbour cages, is not seen on the experimental time scale, but ‘rattling’ motion, which does not involve cage breaking, still persists (569,572). It is also consistent with the existence of ‘islands of mobility’

(565), where rearrangements between ‘similar’ minima are possible, but not long-range ﬂow.
An outline of various theories for the glass transition and the properties of glasses is given in Chapter 10, along with a more detailed account of computational results that characterise the potential energy surfaces of model glasses. An overview of glass forming systems and their complex phenomenology is provided in the following sections.

1.4.2 Glassy materials
The glass transition is important not only for preparing window glass and optical devices, but also in preserving food (609) and for desert insects in times of drought (610). Volcanic glass is a well-known natural material, and it has recently been suggested that comets may contain glassy water, formed by low temperature condensation (611). Although many substances can be captured in a glassy state by suﬃciently rapid cooling of a liquid phase, this is by no means the only preparative route available. Glassy silica, SiO2, can also be obtained by vapour condensation, and other experimental routes to glasses include sputtering, electrolytic deposition, cold compression, heavy particle bombardment, irradiation, grinding a crystal, solvent evaporation, and hydrolysis of organosilicon compounds followed by drying. To obtain glass of suﬃcient purity for use in optical ﬁbres, vapour-phase chemical reactions followed by condensation are employed. For some glasses, such as B2O3, a component of Pyrex glass, crystallisation does not occur even if crystalline seeds are introduced into the melt. Some familiar oxide glasses are used as precursors in the preparation of glass-ceramic materials by devitriﬁcation and crystallisation.
Structural glasses may be obtained for a wide range of materials aside from the most familiar oxides mentioned above, including systems composed of organic molecules such as o-terphenyl (OTP), binary ionic mixtures such as KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 (CKN), hydrogen-bonded systems including KHSO4, water and aqueous solutions of salts such as LiCl, polymers such as polycarbonates and polyvinyl chloride, and metallic alloys such as Zr–Cu and Ni–Nb. Chalcogenide glasses are covalently bonded solids such as As2Se3 and Se, which can be prepared by melting together sulphur, selenium or tellurium with elements such as antimony, arsenic, germanium and silicon. Glassy behaviour has even been characterised for proteins and biopolymers (356, 612–624).
Experimentally, good glass formers have low crystal nucleation probabilities at all temperatures down to Tg. Empirically, molecular liquids with melting points less than half their boiling points can usually be supercooled

Introduction

without crystallisation (625–627), and a number of other semi-empirical criteria for glass formation have been suggested (628,629). Systems that readily form glasses are often characterised by a strong depression in the freezing point for a liquid mixture compared to the pure components, corresponding to a deep eutectic point in the phase diagram (565). Another characteristic feature of good covalently bonded glass formers is the existence of a large number of crystalline polymorphs, as for silica. Low average coordination numbers (586) or a balance between the number of mechanical constraints and the number of degrees of freedom (630) may also underlie glass forming ability (Section 10.1).
Amorphous materials are not necessarily regarded as glasses (631). For example, amorphous silicon, a-Si, exhibits tetrahedrally coordinated silicon atoms as for the crystal, but without any long-range order. The structure is therefore diﬀerent from the liquid phase, where a wide range of coordination numbers are generally observed. A glass with similar structure would be dense and metallic, in contrast to the semiconducting properties of the amorphous solid. a-Si cannot be prepared by quenching a melt (632); instead it is obtained by vapour deposition, where the crystal is heated to evaporate atoms at the lowest possible temperature, and a ﬁlm is grown on a low temperature substrate. Hydrogen-doped a-Si, a-Si:H, can be prepared by chemical vapour deposition from silane vapour, and by reactive sputtering.
In fact, amorphous silicon can be converted to a metallic liquid by ﬂash heating (633), and in computer simulations (634), in accord with thermodynamic expectations (635, 636). This transformation has been described in terms of a weak ﬁrst-order melting transition, and similar processes may occur in supercooled water, liquid germanium and other network systems such as GaSb and AlP (587).
For proteins, glassy characteristics have been investigated in terms of the heat capacity, as monitored by diﬀerential scanning calorimetry. Experiments for native and denatured proteins, either dry or with a small amount of water, have revealed a signiﬁcant heat capacity peak for the denatured state, which has been interpreted in terms of a glass transition (572).
Metallic glasses, or amorphous metallic alloys, can be obtained for a wide range of compositions and have particularly interesting magnetic and mechanical properties, such as metallic conduction but high resistivity (637–641). The ﬁrst reported metallic amorphous materials include thin ﬁlms deposited on liquid helium cooled substrates (642), and a system with composition Au75Si25 obtained by rapid cooling of the liquid (643). High cooling rates of the order 105 to 106 K/s are usually required for glass

formation in materials of this type, and clean conditions are needed to exclude possible nucleation centres (641). However, there are some alloy compositions, such as Pd40Ni40P20, where a glass can be formed with much slower cooling rates of less than 1 K/s (644). The most appropriate compositions for glass forming are those that stabilise the liquid phase relative to crystalline phases, and the atomic diameters of the diﬀerent components generally need to diﬀer by less than 10% (645). Increasing the number of components also appears to inhibit crystallisation (641). In contrast to some of the more conventional oxide glasses, metallic glasses tend to devitrify and crystallise on reheating below Tg via a nucleation and growth mechanism (Section 1.3.5).
The most appropriate structural reference system for metallic glasses appears to be the dense random packing model discussed in Section 1.4.6; descriptions based on microcrystalline aggregates are generally less successful (641). Models that account for some degree of chemical ordering have been shown to provide good ﬁts of experimental data (646). However, it has also been suggested that some apparently amorphous alloys are really aggregates of nanoscale quasicrystals (641), since some aluminium-based alloys such as Al83Mn17 devitrify to give quasicrystals (Section 3.6). Some experiments for metallic glass formers suggest that two distinct types of mechanism contribute to transport processes (647).

1.4.3 The strong/fragile classiﬁcation scheme
The Arrhenius law, where an observable property scales with temperature as exp(±A/T ) for constant A, is ubiquitous in the physical sciences. This functional form is expected whenever a transport or rate process encounters a potential or free energy barrier. However, the temperature dependence of relaxation times or transport properties in some glasses is stronger than the Arrhenius law would suggest. Such behaviour is often termed ‘superArrhenius’, and is also observed in protein dynamics (Section 9.3, Section 9.4). One interpretation of super-Arrhenius behaviour is that the barrier involved grows as the temperature falls, and this picture emerges within both the random energy model (Section 9.4) and treatments based on the PES (Section 10.5). The Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) equation (1.7) (648– 651) is commonly used to ﬁt such behaviour,

τ = τ0 exp[A/(T − T0)],

(1.7)

where τ is a property such as relaxation time, A is a constant, and T0 is a nonzero temperature, at which the relaxation time would apparently

diverge. The Williams–Landel–Ferry equation (652), which was developed for polymers, is equivalent to the above function, and another form is τ = τ0 exp [DT0/(T − T0)], in which the parameter D governs the deviation from Arrhenius behaviour (572, 653). The VTF form is often a good ﬁt over two to four orders of magnitude in τ in the temperature range approaching the glass transition (654, 655). However, the Ferry (656) or Ba¨ssler form (657), which also arises in the random energy model (Section 9.4),

τ = τ0 exp [A/T 2],

(1.8)

can often ﬁt the experimental data equally well without a discontinuity; various other functional forms have also been used (588). The VTF ﬁt is particularly good for glycerol (654, 658), but generally deteriorates for more fragile systems, as deﬁned below.
The degree of super-Arrhenius behaviour was used by Angell (569) to suggest a classiﬁcation scheme for supercooled liquids, as indicated in Fig. 1.42. ‘Strong’ materials have Arrhenius temperature dependence, and include many network glass formers such as silica, while fragile materials, which

are often bound by weaker and less directional forces, exhibit deviations from the Arrhenius law (572, 659, 660). Spin glasses, such as Cu–Mn, as well as proton, vortex and dipole glasses, may exhibit very fragile behaviour when viewed according to this classiﬁcation scheme (572, 661). Optimally ‘constrained’ glasses (630, 662, 663) such as Ge–Se and Ge–As–Se, with 2.4 nearest neighbours on average, tend to exhibit strong characteristics, as do Zr-rich Zr–Cu alloys (664). This behaviour can be quantiﬁed by ﬁtting to the VTF form, above, and deﬁning a strength parameter as A/T0, or D from the alternative VTF expression. This parameter tends to plus inﬁnity for strong systems where T0 = 0. A pressure-dependent strength parameter can be deﬁned in an analogous fashion (665, 666). An alternative quantitative measure of fragility has been deﬁned in terms of the ‘steepness index’ (667),

m=

∂ ln τ ∂(Tg/T )

,
T =Tg

(1.9)

where τ is again a relaxation time or a property such as viscosity. The above measures of fragility are based on dynamical properties, and
other ways to represent these data have been explored (588). In fragile liquids the glass transition is often also associated with a signiﬁcant peak in the heat capacity at Tg, while strong liquids exhibit smoother changes in thermodynamic properties (Fig. 1.43). However, as mentioned above, we must also remember that measurements around Tg may depend upon experimental details such as the cooling rate. Angell has suggested that the larger feature in the heat capacity for fragile liquids is due to a higher density of local minima on the PES as a function of the potential energy (572). This direct connection to the PES is supported by a more detailed model (Section 10.5) (668), along with the suggestion that fragile systems have smaller barriers to diﬀusion. Stillinger has hypothesised that the super-Arrhenius behaviour of fragile liquids is due to a potential energy landscape in which the minima are arranged into ‘craters’ (669). This structure is probably equivalent to a set of alternative funnel-like (Section 1.3.6) features on the PES. An eﬀective activation energy that increases with decreasing temperature can then result because the system is more likely to be found at the bottom of a funnel (Section 8.3.5, Section 9.4, Section 10.5).
Systems composed of tetrahedrally coordinated networks, such as water, silicon, germanium and silica, may exhibit complicated phase behaviour including glassy behaviour (572,653,670,671). For example, in addition to the usual form of amorphous ice, compression vitriﬁcation of water produces a higher density amorphous form (672–675), and evidence for polyamorphism

in other systems has also been discussed (588, 653). Characterising transitions between such polyamorphs, and between the corresponding supercooled liquids (653), provides another challenge for both experimentalists and theoreticians (587, 676–684). For example, the discovery of distinct amorphous regions with diﬀerent densities in a quenched melt of Y2O3– Al2O3 (685) may suggest that a transition, perhaps weakly ﬁrst-order, between supercooled liquids with diﬀerent densities and fragilities was arrested by the quench (653). The transformation between diﬀerent vitreous polyamorphs of water may have similar characteristics (Section 10.2).

where E is the internal energy and C the heat capacity. For a system at constant pressure the enthalpy H replaces the internal energy E. Thermodynamically fragile systems must therefore have either a larger heat capacity diﬀerence, a smaller internal energy diﬀerence between the liquid and the crystal, or a relatively high melting point (Section 10.5).
The above thermodynamic deﬁnition of fragility is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by properties of the crystal through the value of the melting point, Tm. An alternative deﬁnition uses Tg rather than Tm for the reference temperature (688),

as illustrated in Fig. 1.43; the slope of this plot at Tg is ∆C(Tg)/∆S(Tg) (668). Some fragilities calculated from viscosity data are collected in Table 1.1.
The appearance of corresponding strong or fragile behaviour in both dynamic and thermodynamic properties requires a non-trivial correlation, which poses interesting problems for theories of the glass transition (Chapter 10) (668,688–694). One theoretical route to such a connection is provided by catastrophe theory, as described in Section 7.6, and other approaches such as the Adam–Gibbs relation (695) are discussed in Chapter 10.
Supercooled liquids generally have a greater heat capacity, C, than the corresponding crystal, usually by a factor of between one and two, with fragile liquids at the top end of this range. Since the entropy and enthalpy vary with temperature according to the integral of C/T and C, respectively, both these quantities change more rapidly for the liquid. Around Tg the rate of change of entropy of the liquid may be fast enough relative to that of the crystal for a linear extrapolation of the diﬀerence to reach zero at about 0.9 × Tg (572). This situation is sometimes termed an ‘entropy crisis’, since it would result in a disordered state with lower entropy than the crystal, in violation of the third law of thermodynamics (686). The extrapolated temperature at which the entropy diﬀerence would apparently vanish is usually denoted TK, the Kauzmann temperature. Angell has noted that TK and the T0 parameter obtained from a VTF ﬁt are often strongly correlated, and suggested that they may be equivalent and correspond to a conﬁgurational ground state temperature (569).

To avoid such paradoxical behaviour the heat capacity of the supercooled liquid must fall to a value more typical of a solid, which has led to suggestions that the liquid might have an intrinsic metastability limit (686), or that a thermodynamic phase change underlies the glass transition (696), but is obscured by the slow kinetics. As mentioned in Section 1.4.1, when the temperature of the supercooled liquid falls the conﬁguration will inevitably become trapped in a subset of the exponentially large number of disordered local minima on the time scale of any experiment. Equilibrium is now only possible within this more restricted region of the noncrystalline phase space, and the heat capacity falls. Since the region in which the system becomes trapped has similar characteristics to the regions from which it has been cut oﬀ, thermodynamic properties such as volume and internal energy are expected to be continuous. Hence if the glass transition does correspond to a phase transition, it must be higher than ﬁrst-order. The particular region of conﬁguration space in which the system is trapped will depend sensitively on the details of the experiment. However, many important properties of the resulting material will be self-averaging (548), i.e. consistent between diﬀerent experiments. Otherwise it would not be possible to produce optical glass within reproducible parameters, for example.
In the absence of a crystalline phase the equilibrium state of the system at zero kelvin would be the disordered minimum with the lowest potential energy. However, since we expect there to be an exponentially large number of disordered minima with similar potential energy, separated by large barriers compared to kTg, the chance of the system actually ﬁnding the disordered ground state, or ‘ideal glass’, is practically zero for any ﬁnite cooling rate.
Calculations for model glass formers suggest that many low-barrier rearrangements exist where the nearest-neighbour cages are preserved (607,608). A model based on these results is discussed in Section 10.5; in this framework there is a heat capacity peak at Tg when rearrangements corresponding to cage-breaking processes and diﬀusion are frozen out, but the system is not restricted to a single minimum until lower temperature. The entropy of the glass then approaches that of the crystal from above and only tends to zero as T → 0. Alternative scenarios have also been investigated (697) (Section 10.5).

1.4.5 Relaxation

or dielectric perturbation (698–704). This response may be described by the function f (t) = [σ(t) − σ(∞)] / [σ(0) − σ(∞)], where σ is the property in question. The subsequent relaxation can often be ﬁtted to a stretched exponential, or Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW) (705, 706), function:

f (t) = exp[−(t/τ )β].

(1.12)

Here τ is a constant that determines the relaxation time, 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 and β = 1 corresponds to simple exponential decay, known as the Debye limit. Kohlrausch ﬁrst proposed the stretched exponential form to describe the decay of residual charge on a Leyden jar (705), and showed that this function could be derived by assuming that the decay rate decreased with time as tβ−1. Williams and Watts (706) suggested the same form for dielectric relaxation, and many experiments have since been ﬁtted to it in a phenomenological manner (583, 707). Several experimental studies of peptides and proteins have also been interpreted in terms of stretched exponential relaxation (708–710).
The one-parameter ﬁt provided by equation (1.12) is often at least as good (711) as an alternative two-parameter form (712), although other functions have also been used (588). However, a single value of β may not provide an adequate description for the full range of accessible temperature, and a smaller value may be more appropriate at lower temperatures (572), perhaps tending to a ﬁnite limit (701, 713). In fact, relaxation functions are often described as ‘two-step’ over a range of temperature, as indicated in Fig. 1.45. The initial fast relaxation is associated with vibrational degrees of freedom. It is the long-time region that is usually ﬁtted to the stretched exponential form (583, 707, 714). In fact β may also vary depending on the property in question for the same system (701).
In simple liquids relaxation functions usually have the conventional Debye form. However, there is a reasonable correlation between increasing fragility and departure from Debye relaxation in many supercooled liquids (704). Hence, relaxation tends to be nonexponential when the temperature dependence is non-Arrhenius (587). Possible explanations for nonexponential relaxation are discussed in Section 7.2.3 and Section 10.1.1.
Experimentally, dielectric loss spectroscopy has been exploited extensively to study the dielectric relaxation time. Johari and Goldstein ﬁrst applied this technique to rigid molecules, such as chlorobenzene (715), and then nonrigid molecules, such as aliphatic alcohols (716). The dielectric relaxation time is a measure of the response of the polarisation of a material to an applied electric ﬁeld. When a sinusoidal oscillating electric ﬁeld is applied across a sample the complex ﬁeld and displacement are given by E∗ = E0 exp (iωt) and

As a function of frequency decreases monotonically from its static value, (0), to a limiting high frequency value, (∞). In the materials studied by Johari and Goldstein, (0) and (∞) are suﬃciently similar that the peak positions in tan δ and as a function of ω can be considered equivalent. The frequency at which a peak occurs in , ω , is therefore taken as the rate of dielectric relaxation, which is the reciprocal of the corresponding relaxation time. Plotting ln ω against 1/T then reveals whether the relaxation time has Arrhenius or super-Arrhenius temperature dependence.

Introduction

Johari and Goldstein found that the temperature dependence of ω for most glass formers was super-Arrhenius with eﬀective activation energies in the range 120 to 450 kJ/mol, and that the peak broadened and disappeared, or moved out of the observable frequency range, on cooling towards Tg. However, a new peak in often appeared with a relaxation time corresponding to Arrhenius temperature dependence and a smaller activation energy of between about 16 and 40 kJ/mol, or 10 to 20 kTg. These two peaks in the spectrum of were labelled α and β, respectively. The process responsible for the α peak was associated with structural relaxation, which is frozen out at the glass transition because the barriers involved become insurmountable on the observation time scale. The α peak often corresponds to nonexponential relaxation in the supercooled liquid regime, with the β parameter in the KWW equation (1.12) typically between 0.3 and 0.6 for fragile liquids at Tg.
In polymer glasses the presence of two features had previously been associated with motion of the main chain and polar side groups (722). However, the interpretation of the secondary β peak, corresponding to faster relaxation with a smaller barrier, is less clear for other systems. Johari and Goldstein suggested that it might be caused by ‘regions where the structure is relatively loose’ (18, 723), while Williams and Watts pictured this process in terms of hindered reorientation (724). Since not all glass formers exhibit the β relaxation peak, intramolecular degrees of freedom have also been suggested as the cause (725). However, β relaxation has been characterised in systems that lack dielectrically active intramolecular modes, such as toluene (720,726). In some materials the β peak may simply be hidden by the α peak (719, 727, 728). Evidence to support this hypothesis has been presented in terms of dielectric loss spectra for glycerol, propylene carbonate and propylene glycol, where a high frequency feature develops after aging (729). This feature was interpreted in terms of the Johari–Goldstein β relaxation. The separation between these α and β relaxations has been analysed within a coupling model (730–733), which can also reproduce (734) the scaling law observed for dielectric susceptibilities (Section 10.1.1) (701).
The main characteristics of the α relaxation are accounted for by modecoupling theory (Section 10.1.4) (735–737). Since this feature was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Williams as a distinct phenomenon (738) it has also been referred to as the Williams–Go¨tze process (577). The β peak is now often called the Johari–Goldstein β relaxation, or the ‘slow’ β process, even though it is faster than the α relaxation. The latter terminology is used to distinguish this β relaxation from an even faster ‘β’ process that arises in mode-coupling theory (Section 10.1.4). A schematic view of features commonly identiﬁed

The latter features may in fact be caused by the same microscopic process (719). Also shown are the contribution from a ‘fast β’ process associated with ‘cage-rattling’ in mode-coupling theory (Section 10.1.4) and the ‘boson peak’ (Section 1.4.9).
Some quantitative dielectric relaxation spectra are shown in Fig. 1.47, and the corresponding analysis of the relaxation times is illustrated in Fig. 1.48. Detailed study of the line shapes in these spectra led to a description of the β process in terms of a Gaussian distribution of Debye-type processes corresponding to some kind of local, but intermolecular, reorientation (720). The actual degrees of freedom involved in the β process were not identiﬁed, but it was concluded that more than one molecule must be involved, and that the β relaxation is intrinsic to the glassy state.

and 2H NMR experiments led to the conclusion that for sorbitol the whole molecule contributes equally to the β process, while in glycerol the hydrogenbonded OH groups are more rigid than the hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms (739).
The temperature at which the Johari–Goldstein β peak can ﬁrst be distinguished from the α peak in dielectric loss spectroscopy is sometimes labelled Tα−β, and referred to as the α−β ‘bifurcation’ temperature. It may be significant that Tα−β lies close to characteristic temperatures that are identiﬁed in several diﬀerent theoretical models, as discussed in Chapter 10.
Stillinger has suggested that β processes correspond to rearrangements of the system between neighbouring potential energy minima, whilst α processes involve a concerted series of such rearrangements, which move

the conﬁguration from one funnel-like region of the PES to another (669). Since the overall activation energy is larger for the α processes they would be frozen out at a higher temperature. In this picture fragile glasses are associated with a PES that is organised into a multiple funnel-type structure, while the surface for a strong glass is pictured as uniformly rough, so that only β processes are signiﬁcant (669).
The β relaxation has also been investigated by 2H NMR spectroscopy (740–742), and neutron and light scattering experiments (743–745). NMR results for polymers with side chains were interpreted in terms of side chain reorientations for the β relaxation (746,747). Line-shape analysis of 2H NMR spectra for a variety of glass formers suggests that the motions responsible for the β feature involve restricted step-wise reorientation of the molecules (742). For systems that lack a β peak in the dielectric loss spectrum no dynamic process was detected by NMR (742). Light-scattering spectra in the frequency regime ν > 0.3 GHz have been compared with theoretical predictions over a range of temperature (748,749), leading to the conclusion that much remains to be understood about the behaviour of glasses in this regime.

Introduction

1.4.6 Scattering experiments

Determining the structure of a disordered material is more involved than for a crystal, where it is only necessary to solve the structure for a subunit that can be repeated periodically to produce the whole structure (565). For example, x-ray diﬀraction by a crystal leads to constructive interference if the Bragg or von Laue conditions are satisﬁed, i.e. the change in wavevector Q = q − q must be a reciprocal lattice vector (750). Here, the wavevector is deﬁned in terms of a unit vector in the direction of propagation, nˆ, and the wavelength, λ, with q = 2πnˆ/λ. For a crystal composed of M periodically repeated cells, each containing N atoms, the normal mode vibrations can be labelled ωj(q), where 1 ≤ j ≤ 3N and there are M values of q corresponding to distinct solutions for each of these 3N ‘branches’ in the Brillouin zone. For three ‘acoustic’ branches the frequency tends to zero as q → 0, and for the remaining 3N −3 ‘optical’ branches the frequency remains ﬁnite in this limit. Vibrational modes can be further divided into transverse and longitudinal, depending on the direction of the corresponding Hessian eigenvector with respect to the scattering vector q. However, for a general value of q the modes are a mixture of acoustic and optical, with both longitudinal and transverse components. For an amorphous solid the unit cell is essentially inﬁnite and the Brillouin zone eﬀectively collapses to q = 0 (565).
The elastic scattering intensity from a monatomic isotropic material can be written in terms of the radial distribution function, g(r), also known as the pair correlation function or pair distribution function (Fig. 1.49). In an isotropic system 4πr2ρg(r)dr is the average number of particles at distances between r and r + dr from a central particle, where ρ = N/V is the mean density and V is the volume. The scattering intensity at an angle 2α can then be written in the form

I(Q) = N f (Q)2 + N f (Q)2 ∞ 4πr2ρ(g(r) − 1) sin Qr dr,

0

Qr

(1.15)

where N is the number of scattering atoms, and f (Q) is a ‘form factor’ or ‘atomic scattering factor’, which depends on Q but is a tabulated function for any given element. For elastic scattering with |q| = |q | = 2π/λ it is easy to show that Q = 4πλ−1 sin α (565). Deﬁning a reduced scattering intensity as

F (Q) = Q

and a reduced radial distribution function as

The function g(r) − 1 is usually written as h(r), so that G(r) = 4πrρh(r). Both F (Q) and G(r) oscillate about zero.
To obtain the radial distribution function from experimental data requires a numerical approximation to the Fourier transform of F (Q). Since

Introduction

data can only be collected for a ﬁnite range of Q up to some maximum value, Qmax, there is a loss of resolution for distances less than 2π/Qmax (565). Since x-rays are scattered by electrons, the peaks in g(r) are interpreted as interatomic spacings, although structure due to electron density in covalent bonds may also be resolved. The ﬁrst minimum in g(r) is often used as a cutoﬀ value in deﬁning nearest-neighbour interactions, and the integral of g(r) provides the average coordination number. In covalently bonded disordered materials the second peak in g(r), corresponding to second-nearest neighbours, is usually wider than for the ﬁrst peak (565). The position of the ﬁrst peak in F (Q) does not generally have a simple real-space interpretation.
Neutron scattering experiments require far more sophisticated experiments, but circumvent some of the problems inherent in x-ray work. In particular, common x-ray sources have relatively small values for Qmax, thus limiting the resolution, and the intensity variations in I(Q) include a rapidly diminishing contribution from f (Q)2 as a function of Q, which leads to increasing errors for large Q. Correlations due to electron density in covalent bonds can also be a problem in x-ray scattering experiments, especially for systems composed mainly of light atoms. Neutrons obtained from a nuclear reactor typically have wavelengths in the range 0.1 to 1 ˚A, and energies between 8 eV and 80 meV (565). The lowest energy ‘thermal’ neutrons are produced by a moderator, and their energies are comparable to vibrational energy levels, unlike x-rays, where the characteristic energies are generally much higher. Inelastic scattering may therefore be observed in neutron experiments, where energy is transferred to vibrational modes of the scatterer, and the wavelength of the incident and scattered neutrons is diﬀerent.
If the energy and momentum transferred are written as h¯ω and Q, respectively, then a dynamic scattering function, S(Q, ω), and a generalised pair correlation function, G(r, t), can be deﬁned in terms of a double Fourier transform (565):

S(Q, ω) describes the probability that a neutron can transfer momentum Q and energy h¯ω to the sample, while G(r, t) describes the probability of ﬁnding two atoms at position R over the time t. The intensity of the

elastically scattered neutrons, Iel(Q), and the total scattering intensity, I(Q), can be measured independently, and are given by

where b2 is the mean neutron ‘scattering length’, averaged over all the isotopes of the element in question, and ρeq(r) is the equilibrium radial density distribution (or ρg(r)), averaged over several vibrational periods. exp(−2W ) is the Debye–Waller factor, where W = Q2 u2 /6 and u2 is the meansquare vibrational displacement (565). u2 is expected to vary linearly with temperature for harmonic vibrations. For closed-shell atoms the neutron scattering length b2 is independent of Q, but varies randomly for diﬀerent elements and isotopes of the same element. Isotopic substitution can therefore be used to extract radial distribution functions for diﬀerent pairs of elements in a nonmonatomic system.
Spectra obtained from electromagnetic radiation generally involve either high spatial resolution, as in x-ray scattering, or high temporal resolution, as for laser pulses. However, inelastic neutron scattering can provide information about both position and motion (751). The momentum transfer, Q, and the energy change, h¯ω, produce spatial and time scale data, respectively. The dielectric loss spectra described in Section 1.4.5 and NMR experiments provide complementary information in terms of longer time scales but lower spatial resolution. Information obtained by neutron scattering following isotopic substitution, particularly deuteration, can provide particularly useful data.
The generalised pair correlation function G(r, t) is also known as the van Hove space-time correlation function (752). It can be written in a number of diﬀerent forms (753, 754), including an equilibrium ensemble average involving the Dirac delta function and a sum over the position vectors, Xu and Xv, of all pairs of atoms, u and v:

where the s and d subscripts stand for ‘self’ and ‘distinct’, and ρ(r, t) = v δ[r − rv(t)]. In the ﬁrst line G(r, t) is written as the ensemble average
of a density–density correlation function, and in this form it enters into the mode-coupling theory of glasses (735–737) discussed in Section 10.1.4. Gs(r, t) describes the probability of ﬁnding the same atom at position R after a time interval t.
The dynamic scattering function, S(Q, ω), can also be written as a sum of coherent and incoherent parts, corresponding to the distinct and self van Hove correlation functions, respectively (577, 754):

for N scattering sites of mass M , where exp(−2W ) is the Debye–Waller factor, n(ω) = 1/ (exp [−(µ − ¯hω)/kT ] − 1) is the Bose occupation number, and µ is the chemical potential.
The inﬁnite time limit of the average in the integrand of the incoherent dynamic structure factor has been proposed as a wavevector-dependent order parameter for spin glasses (756), and is related to the average value of the Debye–Waller factor in the harmonic approximation if diﬀusion is absent. If diﬀusion is present then this order parameter decays to zero exponentially with time. Alternatively, an order parameter based on the coherent dynamic structure factor has been proposed (757).
Another useful quantity is the static structure factor, S(Q), which can be
