Consider three qubits A, B, and C which may be entangled with each other. We show that there is a trade-off between A’s entanglement with B and its entanglement with C. This relation is expressed in terms of a measure of entanglement called the concurrence, which is related to the entanglement of formation. Speciﬁcally, we show that the squared concurrence between A and B, plus the squared concurrence between A and C, cannot be greater than the squared concurrence between A and the pair BC. This inequality is as strong as it could be, in the sense that for any values of the concurrences satisfying the corresponding equality, one can ﬁnd a quantum state consistent with those values. Further exploration of this result leads to a deﬁnition of an essential three-way entanglement of the system, which is invariant under permutations of the qubits.

Quantum entanglement has rightly been the subject of
much study in recent years as a potential resource for com-
munication and information processing. As with other re-
sources such as free energy and information, one would like
to have a quantitative theory of entanglement giving speciﬁc rules about how it can and cannot be manipulated; indeed, such a theory has begun to be developed. The ﬁrst step in building the theory has been to quantify entanglement itself. In the last few years a number of entanglement measures for bipartite states have been introduced and analyzed ͓1–7͔, the one most relevant to the present work being the ‘‘entanglement of formation’’ ͓2͔, which is intended to quantify the amount of quantum communication required to create a given state. In the present paper we draw on previous work on entanglement of formation ͓6,7͔ in order to explore another basic quantitative question: To what extent can an object be simultaneously entangled with two other objects?
Unlike classical correlations, quantum entanglement cannot be freely shared among many objects. For example, given a triple of spin-1/2 particles A, B, and C, if particle A is fully entangled with particle B, e.g., if they are in the singlet state (1/&)(͉↑↓͘Ϫ͉↓↑͘), then particle A cannot be simultaneously entangled with particle C. ͑If A were entangled with C, then the pair AB would also be entangled with C and would therefore have a mixed-state density matrix, whereas the singlet state is pure.͒ One expects that a less extreme form of this restriction should also hold: if A is partly entangled with B, then A can have only a limited entanglement with C. The ﬁrst goal of this paper is to verify this intuition and express it quantitatively. We will see that the restriction on the sharing of entanglement takes a particularly elegant form in terms of a measure of entanglement called the ‘‘concurrence,’’ which is closely related to the entanglement of formation. Further analysis of this result will lead us naturally to a quantity that measures an essential three-way entanglement of the system and is invariant under all permutations of the particles ͓8͔.
The present work is related to recent work on the characterization of multiparticle states in terms of invariants under

local transformations ͓9–12͔; indeed, both the concurrence and our measure of three-way entanglement are invariants in this sense. Our work is also related to research exploring the connection between entanglement and cloning ͓13–17͔. An example along these lines was studied by Bruß, who asked, in the case of a singlet pair AB, to what extent particle B’s entanglement with particle A can be shared symmetrically and isotropically with a third particle, for a purpose such as teleportation where isotropy is desired ͓18͔. Our investigation is similar in spirit to that of Bruß but has a different focus in that we are looking for a general law that is independent of assumptions about symmetry or isotropy. Some of the results presented here have been mentioned in a recent paper by one of us ͓19͔, but the proofs and most of the details and observations have not been previously published. In this paper we conﬁne our attention to binary quantum objects ͑qubits͒ such as spin-1/2 particles—we will use the generic basis labels ͉0͘ and ͉1͘ rather than ͉↑͘ and ͉↓͘—but the same questions could be raised for larger objects.
We begin by deﬁning concurrence. Let A and B be a pair of qubits, and let the density matrix of the pair be ␳AB , which may be pure or mixed. We deﬁne the ‘‘spin-ﬂipped’’ density matrix to be

˜␳ABϭ͑ ␴y  ␴y ͒␳A*B͑ ␴y  ␴y ͒,

͑1͒

where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation in the standard basis ͕͉00͘, ͉01͘, ͉10͘, ͉11͖͘ and ␴y expressed in the same basis is the matrix
ͩ ͪ 0 Ϫi . i0

As both ␳AB and ˜␳AB are positive operators, it follows that the product ␳AB˜␳AB , though non-Hermitian, also has only real and non-negative eigenvalues. Let the square roots of
these eigenvalues, in decreasing order, be ␭1 , ␭2 , ␭3 , and ␭4 . Then the concurrence of the density matrix ␳AB is deﬁned as

For the special case in which the state of AB is pure, one can
show that CABϭ2ͱdet ␳A, where ␳A is the density matrix of
qubit A, that is, the trace of ␳AB over qubit B. It is by no means obvious from the deﬁnition that the
concurrence is a measure of entanglement for mixed states.
This interpretation comes from earlier work, in which a spe-
ciﬁc connection is established between the concurrence and the entanglement of formation of a pair of qubits ͓7͔. For the purpose of this paper it is sufﬁcient to note that Cϭ0 corresponds to an unentangled state, Cϭ1 corresponds to a completely entangled state, and the entanglement of formation is a monotonically increasing function of C.1 At present, the concurrence is deﬁned only for a pair of qubits, not for
higher-dimensional systems.
We now turn to the ﬁrst problem of this paper: given a
pure state of three qubits A, B, and C, how is the concurrence
between A and B related to the concurrence between A and
C? For this special case—a pure state of three qubits—the
formula for the concurrence simpliﬁes: each pair of qubits,
being entangled with only one other qubit in a joint pure
state, is described by a density matrix having at most two nonzero eigenvalues. It follows that the product ␳AB˜␳AB also has only two nonzero eigenvalues. We can use this fact and Eq. ͑2͒ to write the following inequality for the concurrence CAB between A and B.2

Here ␳AB is the density matrix of the pair AB, obtained from the original pure state by tracing over qubit C. Equation ͑3͒ and the analogous equation for CAC allow us to bound the sum CA2 BϩCA2 C:

The next paragraph is devoted to evaluating the right-hand

␦n jЈ␦nЈj͒ we perform a similar substitution for ⑀mmЈ⑀iЈi . These substitutions directly give us

͑8͒

By symmetry we must also have

Tr͑ ␳AC˜␳AC͒ϭ2͑ det ␳Aϩdet ␳CϪdet ␳B͒.

͑9͒

Summing these last two equations, we ﬁnally get a simple expression for the right-hand side of Eq. ͑4͒, namely,

Tr͑ ␳AB˜␳AB͒ϩTr͑ ␳AC˜␳AC͒ϭ4 det ␳A .

͑10͒

Equations ͑4͒ and ͑10͒ give us our ﬁrst main result:

CA2 BϩCA2 Cр4 det ␳A .

͑11͒

We can interpret the right-hand side of Eq. ͑11͒ as fol-
lows. If we regard the pair BC as a single object, it makes sense to speak of the concurrence CA(BC) between qubit A and the pair BC, because, even though the state space of BC
is four dimensional, only two of those dimensions are necessary to express the state ͉␰͘ of ABC. ͑The two necessary dimensions are those spanned by the two eigenstates of ␳BC that have nonzero eigenvalues. That there are only two such
eigenvalues follows from the fact that A is only a qubit and that the state of the whole system is pure.͒ We may thus treat
A and BC, at least for this purpose, as a pair of qubits in a
pure state. As we have mentioned before, the concurrence for
this case is simply 2ͱdet ␳A. We can therefore rewrite our
result as

CA2 Bϩ CA2 Cр CA2 ͑BC͒.

͑12͒

Informally, Eq. ͑12͒ can be expressed as follows. Qubit A has a certain amount of entanglement with the pair BC. This amount bounds A’s entanglement with qubits B and C taken individually, and the part of the entanglement that is devoted to qubit B ͑as measured by the squared concurrence͒ is not available to qubit C.
We will say more shortly about the case of three qubits in a pure state, but at this point it is worth mentioning a generalization to mixed states. If ABC is in a mixed state ␳, then CA(BC) is not deﬁned, because all four dimensions of BC might be involved, but we can deﬁne a related quantity

the

prescription.3

Consider

all

pos-

sible pure-state decompositions of the state ␳, that is, all sets

͕(␺i , pi)͖ such that ␳ϭ ͚ipi͉␺i͗͘␺i͉. For each of these decompositions, one can compute the average value of CA2 (BC):

͚ ͗CA2 ͑BC͒͘ϭ piCA2 ͑BC͒͑ ␺i͒.

The minimum of this average over all decompositions of ␳ is

what

we

deﬁne

to

be

Eq. ͑12͒ then holds for mixed states:

.

͑14͒

To prove this, consider the pure states ͉␺i͘ belonging to an optimal decomposition of ␳, that is, a decomposition that

minimizes ͗CA2 (BC)͘. We can write our basic inequality, Eq. ͑12͒, for each such pure state and then average both sides of

the inequality over the whole decomposition. The right-hand

side

of

the

resulting

inequality

is

( C2 )

min A(BC)

(␳),

which

is

what

we want on the right-hand side. On the left-hand side we

have two terms: ͑i͒ the average of the squared concurrence

between A and B over a set of mixed states whose average is

␳AB ͓i.e., TrC(␳)͔, and ͑ii͒ the average of the squared concurrence between A and C over a set of mixed states whose

average is ␳AC . It is a fact that the squared concurrence is a convex function on the set of density matrices.4 That is, the average of C2 over the ensemble is greater than or equal to the value of C2 for the average density matrix. In this case

the values of C2 for the average density matrices are CA2 B ϭC2(␳AB) and CA2 CϭC2(␳AC). The sum of these two quantities must thus be less than or equal to (C2)Am(inBC)(␳), which is what we wanted to prove.

Returning to the case of pure states, one may wonder how

tight the inequality ͑12͒ is. Could one ﬁnd, for example, a

more stringent bound of the same form, based on a different

measure of entanglement? To address this question, consider

the following pure state of ABC:

͉ ␾ ͘ ϭ ␣ ͉ 100͘ ϩ ␤ ͉ 010͘ ϩ ␥ ͉ 001͘ ,

͑15͒

where the three positions in the kets refer to qubits A, B, and C in that order. For this state, one ﬁnds that CABϭ2͉␣␤͉,
CACϭ2͉␣␥͉, and CA(BC)ϭ2͉␣͉ͱ͉␤͉2ϩ͉␥͉2. Thus the in-
equality ͑12͒ becomes in this case an equality: CA2 BϩCA2 C ϭCA2 (BC). This example shows that for any values of the concurrences satisfying this equality, there is a quantum state
that is consistent with those values.

Now let ⌫(C) be a monotonically increasing function of C

that we might propose as an alternative measure of entangle-

ment. For simplicity let us assume that ⌫(0)ϭ0 and ⌫(1)

ϭ1. Because of the above example, ⌫ could satisfy the in-

equality

More-

over, the only way ⌫ can match C in those cases where C

gives an equality is for ⌫ to be equal to C. In this sense, C is

an optimal measure of entanglement with respect to the in-

equality given in Eq. ͑12͒. Note, however, that the above argument applies only to functions of C. There could in prin-

ciple be other measures of entanglement that are not functions of C that could make an equal claim to optimality.
The entanglement of formation is a function of C, but it is a concave function of C2 and therefore does not satisfy the

inequality EABϩEACрEA(BC) . Consider, for example, the state (1/&)͉100͘ϩ(1/2)͉010͘ϩ(1/2)͉001͘. One ﬁnds that

the relevant entanglements of formation are EABϭ0.601, EACϭ0.601, and EA(BC)ϭ1. Thus, contrary to what one
might expect, the sum of the entanglements of formation

between A and the separate qubits B and C is greater than the

entanglement capacity of a single qubit. This is not a para-

dox; it simply shows us that entanglement of formation does

not exhibit this particular kind of additivity. ͑This sense of

‘‘additivity’’ should not be confused with the additivity of

entanglement when one combines pairs to make larger sys-

tems ͓7͔. It is not known whether entanglement of formation

satisﬁes the latter notion of additivity.͒

We have just seen that there are some states for which the

inequality ͑12͒ becomes an equality. Of course there are

other states for which the inequality is strict. As we will see,

it turns out to be very interesting to consider the difference

between the two sides of Eq. ͑12͒. This difference can be

thought of as the amount of entanglement between A and BC

that cannot be accounted for by the entanglements of A with

B and C separately. In the following paragraphs we refer to

this quantity as the ‘‘residual entanglement.’’

Let the system ABC be in a pure state ͉␰͘, and, as before,

let the components of ͉␰͘ in the standard basis be aijk :

͚ ͉␰͘ϭ aijk͉i jk͘.

͑16͒

ijk

3According to Eq. ͑12͒, the quantity that is traded off between the pair AB and the pair AC is not the concurrence itself but rather the
square of the concurrence. For this reason, it is convenient in this discussion of mixed states to take C2 rather than C as the quantity to be averaged and minimized.
4It follows from Ref. ͓7͔ that the concurrence is a convex nonnegative function on the set of density matrices for two qubits. The
square of the concurrence is therefore also convex.

According to Eqs. ͑3͒ and ͑10͒ and the discussion following Eq. ͑11͒, the residual entanglement is equal to

This

get the same result. We can now therefore write down an

expression for the residual entanglement:

CA2 ͑BC͒ϪCA2 BϪCA2 Cϭ4͉d1Ϫ2d2ϩ4d3͉.

͑22͒

Note that the residual entanglement does not depend on which qubit one takes as the ‘‘focus’’ of the construction. In our calculations we have focused on entanglements with qubit A, but if we had chosen qubit B instead, we would have found that

CB2 ͑CA͒ϪCB2 CϪCB2 Aϭ4͉d1Ϫ2d2ϩ4d3͉.

͑23͒

The residual entanglement thus represents a collective prop-
erty of the three qubits that is unchanged by permutations; it
measures an essential three-qubit entanglement. If we call this quantity ␶ABC , we can summarize the main results of this paper in the following equation:

͑21͒

We can get a mental picture of this expression by imagining

the eight coefﬁcients aijk attached to the corners of a cube. Then each term appearing in d1 , d2 , or d3 is a product of four of the coefﬁcients aijk such that the ‘‘center of mass’’ of the four is at the center of the cube. Such conﬁgurations fall

into three classes: those in which the four coefﬁcients lie on

a body diagonal and each one is used twice (d1), those in which they lie on a diagonal plane (d2), and those in which they lie on the vertices of a tetrahedron (d3). Within each category, all the possible conﬁgurations are given the same

weight.

In words, the entanglement of A with BC can be manifested
in three forms—entanglement with B, entanglement with C,
and an essential three-way entanglement of the triple—and
these three forms must share the total entanglement. As an
example, consider the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state (1/&)(͉000͘ϩ͉111͘) ͓21͔. For this state the concurrence of each qubit with the rest of the system is 1, the quantity ␶ABC is also 1, and all the pairwise concurrences are zero ͑the
qubits in each pair are classically correlated but not entangled͒. Thus Eq. ͑24͒ in this case becomes 1ϭ0ϩ0ϩ1.
Finally, we note that the expression for ␶ABC in terms of d1 , d2 , and d3 ͓Eq. ͑22͔͒ can be rewritten, after a little more algebra, in a more standard form:

ͯ ͚ ␶ A B C ϭ 2

aijkaiЈjЈmanpkЈanЈpЈmЈ

ͯ ϫ⑀iiЈ⑀ j jЈ⑀kkЈ⑀mmЈ⑀nnЈ⑀ ppЈ ,

͑25͒

where the sum is over all the indices. This form does not immediately reveal the invariance of ␶ABC under permutations of the qubits, but the invariance is there nonetheless.
It would be very interesting to know which of the results of this paper generalize to larger objects or to larger collections of objects. At this point it is not clear how one might begin to generalize this approach to qutrits or higher dimensional objects, because the spin-ﬂip operation seems peculiar to qubits ͓22͔. On the other hand, it appears very likely that at least some of these results can be extended to larger collections of qubits. The one solid piece of evidence we can offer is the existence of a generalization of the state ͉␾͘ of Eq. ͑15͒ to n qubits:
