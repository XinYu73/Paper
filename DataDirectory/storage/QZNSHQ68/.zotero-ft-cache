ABSTRACT: CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 display much stronger

negative thermal expansion ppm·K−1, respectively) than

(NTE) (αL100 ZrW2O8 and

K ∼ −18 and −22 other corner-shared

framework structures. Their NTE is comparable to that reported

for framework solids containing multiatom bridges, such as metal

cyanides and metal−organic frameworks. However, they are

formable as ceramics, transparent over a wide wavelength range

and can be handled in air; these characteristics can be beneﬁcial

for applications. The NTE of CaZrF6 is strongly temperaturedependent, and ﬁrst-principles calculations show that it is largely driven by vibrational modes below ∼150 cm−1. CaZrF6 is elastically soft with a bulk modulus (K300K) of 37 GPa and, upon compression, starts to disorder at ∼400 MPa. The strong NTE of CaZrF6, which remains cubic to <10 K, contrasts with cubic CoZrF6, which only displays modest NTE above its rhombohedral to cubic phase transition at ∼270 K. CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 belong to a large and compositionally diverse family of materials, AIIBIVF6, providing for a detailed exploration of the chemical and structural factors controlling NTE and many opportunities for the design of controlled thermal expansion materials.

1. INTRODUCTION
Few materials display strong volume negative thermal
expansion (NTE) over a large temperature range. The longtime leading NTE exemplar was ZrW2O8,1 in which NTE arises from low-frequency vibrations involving the correlated motion of corner-shared framework polyhedra.2,3 ZrW2O8 and other materials displaying strong NTE have attracted considerable
attention because of the rarity of the phenomenon and the
possibility of using them to compensate for the positive thermal
expansion of other materials either in expansion-controlled composites or as separate components.4 To move signiﬁcantly beyond the expansion characteristics of ZrW2O81 and other oxide frameworks, solids with spatially extended links between
structural units or alternative mechanisms for their NTE have
been pursued. This has resulted in the discovery of very strong NTE because of vibrations in metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate links5,6 and cyanide-bridged frameworks7−9 and materials where magnetostrictive10,11 or electronic12,13 mechanisms operate. For potential application, NTE
materials need to be stable under the conditions of use and
amenable to the fabrication of composites or bulk components.
Both MOFs and cyanide-bridged frameworks are not readily
processed into ceramic bodies, and MOFs only display NTE

when carefully evacuated to remove guests, such as atmospheric

moisture, from their pore systems.

Metal ﬂuorides are known to adopt structures analogous to

those of oxides. However, the more ionic character of the M−F

bonding can lead to very diﬀerent thermophysical properties. In

an early study of NTE in ﬂuorides, we reported that ScF3,
which has a very simple ReO3-type structure and remains cubic to <10 K,14 displays strong NTE over a wide temperature range.14 As they can provide good optical transparency into the

IR and be fabricated in ceramic form, metal ﬂuorides with

atypical thermal expansion characteristics have potential for

application in optics. Notably, ﬂuorozirconate glasses, such as

ZBLAN (ZrF4−BaF2−LaF3−AlF3−NaF) compositions, are
used in IR-transparent optical ﬁbers, but these glasses display strong positive thermal expansion.15 Eﬀorts to tune the thermal

lowering transition is typically associated with vibrational mode

softening at the R-point, and in ScF3, this same mode makes a major contribution to its NTE.20

While the number of simple MIIIF3 with ReO3-connectivity is

limited, there are many AIIBIVF6 salt cation-ordered ReO3-type

compositions that adopt rock structures (Figure 1).21−23

Several of these maintain cubic symmetry, which is necessary for strong NTE, to low temperature. The thermal expansion of this family of materials has received little attention, but the limited data available for CoZrF6, immediately above a rhombohedral (R3̅) to cubic (Fm3̅m) phase transition, show that its expansion coeﬃcient is close to zero at room temperature.24 Our observation that the highly ionic ScF3 remains cubic to <10 K and displays strong NTE over a wide temperature range14 motivated the present study of CaZrF6 and CaHfF6, which are also both highly ionic, and a comparison of their behavior to that of CoZrF6 and ScF3. In this paper, we examine the remarkable behavior of CaZrF6 as a function of temperature and pressure, using diﬀraction methods, and complement these studies with ﬁrst-principles calculations of vibrational modes.

contained in an EasyLab “Diacell Bragg-(G)” diaphragm
diamond anvil cell (DAC) while the pressure was continuously
increased. Pressure was determined using Bragg peaks from
NaCl, which was mixed with the sample prior to loading the DAC, and the Birch equation of state for NaCl.25 Alfa silicone oil, with a molecular weight of 237 g·mol−1, was used as a pressure-transmitting ﬂuid. High-pressure X-ray diﬀraction data
were also recorded at the 11-ID-B beamline of the Advanced
Photon Source between 298 and 523 K at precisely controlled
pressures up to 310 MPa, using a heated titanium pressure vessel and background reducing internal mask (BRIM)26 as described previously.16 Infrared spectroscopic measurements
were made using a Bruker Alpha Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrometer equipped with an attenuated total reﬂection (ATR) module.
Density functional theory calculations were carried out with software provided in the QUANTUM-Espresso toolkit.27 Calculations were performed using a plane-wave energy cutoﬀ
of 160 Ry, norm-conserving pseudopotentials (valence electron conﬁgurations: Ca [3s23p64s2], Zr [4s24p64d25s2], F [2s22p5]),28 and a generalized gradient approximation of the exchange and correlation energy functional.29 The PWscf code
was used to perform total energy calculations and structural
optimizations, while the Phonon code was used to compute
phonon frequencies. We obtained a lattice parameter and a bulk
modulus for CaZrF6 at 0 K and 0 MPa equal to 8.78 Å and 51.7 GPa, respectively. The diﬀerence between the calculated and experimental lattice constant at low temperature is ∼3%, which
is within the limits of agreement typically reached by this type of calculation. Mode Grüneisen parameters, which are indicative of a vibrational mode’s contribution to thermal expansion,30 were calculated via numerical diﬀerentiation.
Phonon frequencies for CaZrF6 were calculated at the equilibrium volume for 0 K and 0 MPa and with a reduction
in lattice constant of up to 0.06% corresponding to a pressure of ∼100 MPa.

2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
M(II)(Zr/Hf)F6 was prepared via the solid-state reaction of M(II)F2 and ZrF4/HfF4 powders. For the synthesis of CaZrF6, CaHfF6, and CoZrF6, the starting materials were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. The powders were mixed and pelletized under a
dry nitrogen atmosphere, and each sample was placed into
either a copper tube (CoZrF6) or a nickel tube (CaZrF6 and CaZrF6). The ends of the metal tubes were sealed by arcwelding under an argon atmosphere, and then the tubes were
placed in an evacuated quartz ampule. The ampules were heated for 24 h at 750 °C for the synthesis of CaZrF6 and at 850 °C for the syntheses of CaHfF6 and CoZrF6. The products were cooled slowly to room temperature using a 12 h ramp for
CaZrF6 and CaZrF6 and using a 3 h ramp for CoZrF6. All sample handling/preparation for the diﬀraction measure-
ments was performed in an inert atmosphere glovebox (neutron) or glovebag (X-ray). Neutron powder diﬀraction
measurements were performed using the PAC sample environ-
ment on the POWGEN instrument at the Spallation Neutron
Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Low- and hightemperature X-ray powder diﬀraction measurements were performed using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream (100− 500 K) and a resistively heated furnace (350−1173 K) on the
17-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. High-pressure X-ray diﬀraction data (298 K and P < ∼1.5 GPa) were recorded at 17-BM for a sample

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Thermal Expansion of Cubic CaZrF6 and CaHfF6. Rietveld analyses of neutron diﬀraction data (10−300 K), using the reported structure of cubic CoZrF624 as a starting point, for
CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 revealed that both remain cubic down to at
least 10 K and display very strong NTE. A similar stability

against distortion on cooling was previously observed for ScF3 and is probably associated with the increase in electrostatic

repulsion between like-charged ions on distortion of these

highly ionic ﬂuorides.14 The observed NTE for CaZrF6 and

CaHfF6 that for

(Figure 2) ScF3 (αl ∼

is signiﬁcantly greater −14 and −8 ppmK−1

in at

magnitude than 100 and 300 K,

respectively) and is comparable to that reported for framework

solids containing multiatom bridges, such as cyanides7−9 and

MOFs.5,6

Their low-temperature linear coeﬃcients of thermal

expansion are highly temperature-dependent (Figure 2), with

minima at ∼100 K and a rapid rise to zero below 50 K, as

required by thermodynamics. The temperature dependence

above 100 K is signiﬁcantly greater than that reported for Zn(CN)28 and MOF-5.6 The thermal expansion of CaZrF6 and CaHfF6, which are structurally and chemically very similar, appear to be somewhat diﬀerent, although the signiﬁcant scatter

in the CTE values for CaHf6 complicates their interpretation. The hafnium compound apparently shows a less rapid increase

in the magnitude of its NTE at very low temperatures but a

The nature of the low-frequency vibrational modes underpinning NTE in ZrW2O8,2,3 M(CN)2 (M: Zn, Cd),32 and MOF-533 has been the subject of considerable recent interest. While early work focused on the transverse displacement of anions and the rocking of rigid structural units,34 a more complex picture involving correlated rotations, translations, and distortions of structural building units has emerged in some cases.2,3,35 The atomic displacement parameters derived from the neutron diﬀraction data for CaZrF6 (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information) show a strong temperature dependence for the component associated with ﬂuoride motion perpendicular to the Ca−F−Zr vector (U33); this behavior is consistent with a rigid unit mode (RUM) polyhedral rocking mechanism for NTE,34 but the apparent diﬀerence in expansion between CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 (Figure 2b) suggests that some modes contributing to the NTE may involve the displacement of Zr/Hf, as the diﬀerent masses of these elements would not otherwise be expected to play a role. For simple solids, the temperature dependence of atomic displacement parameters and their values at 0 K can be used to estimate a material’s Debye temperature.36 An analysis of this type for CaZrF6, applied solely to U33 for ﬂuoride, suggests a Debye temperature of ∼220 K, which is comparable to the energy of the vibrations with the largest negative contributions to thermal expansion (see below).
Phonon dispersion curves for cubic CaZrF6 (Figure 3a), calculated using a density-functional perturbation theory

greater magnitude by ∼100 K. Analyses of X-ray powder diﬀraction data collected for CaZrF6 in the range 100−1173 K show that its coeﬃcient of thermal expansion rises (Figure 2a)
almost monotonically with temperature between 400 and 800 K, reaching −4 ppm·K−1 at 900 K. Above 900 K, products from
sample decomposition or from reaction with the fused silica
sample tube become apparent in the X-ray data (Figure S2 of
the Supporting Information), but some CaZrF6 persists until ∼1050 K, which is above the temperature used for its synthesis. The strong temperature dependence of the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion must reﬂect increasing contributions from vibrational modes with positive Grüneisen parameters
compensating for the contribution from low-energy modes
with negative parameters. This may be a general characteristic of ﬂuorides that show strong NTE at low temperatures, as all
the vibrational modes, including those that contribute to bond
elongation, are at low frequency because of the relatively low force constants associated with ionic metal ﬂuoride bonds.
In NTE framework solids, such as CaZrF6, the true M−X bond lengths are expected to increase on heating, with the NTE
arising from transverse thermal motion of bridging species (see later). However, the apparent M−X bond lengths, derived from
the crystallographic coordinates without taking into account
correlated thermal motion, often decrease on heating, see for example Evans et al.31 The neutron diﬀraction analyses for cubic CaZrF6 show that the apparent Ca−F and Zr−F bond lengths decrease in a similar fashion on heating from 10 to 300
K. However, analyses of the X-ray data suggest that in the hightemperature regime the apparent Zr−F bond lengths continue to decrease on heating, but those for Ca−F start to increase.

approach,27 show that all modes have positive frequencies, which is consistent with the absence of a structural phase transition on cooling to 10 K. There are no modes above 620 cm−1, in agreement with reﬂectance IR measurements (Figure S6 of the Supporting Information), which show the main onset of absorption at ∼650 cm−1 (corresponding to ∼15 μm or ∼80 meV). Mode Grüneisen parameters, derived from the calculated change in phonon frequency on compression,

indicate that both the low dispersion modes in the range 500− 620 cm−1 and the highest energy modes around 250 cm−1 make positive contributions to the material’s thermal expansion, as they have predominantly positive Grüneisen parameters. The most strongly negative Grüneisen parameters (Figure 3b) are associated with modes below ∼150 cm−1 (∼215 K). There are
negative contributions from modes across the entire Brillouin zone, but the most negative Grüneisen parameters are associated with modes close to the X point. This behavior
somewhat contrasts that of ScF3, in which low-frequency modes close to the R point make major contributions to NTE,
including the soft mode that is responsible for its cubic-torhombohedral transition on compression.20
3.2. Thermal Expansion and Phase Transitions of
CoZrF6. The strong NTE shown by cubic CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 contrasts with the behavior of CoZrF6. X-ray powder diﬀraction measurements on CoZrF6 show strong positive volume thermal expansion below the R3̅ to Fm3̅m phase transition (∼270 K), followed by low positive thermal expansion immediately above
the transition and modest NTE at higher temperatures (Figure 4). In the R3̅ phase, the expansion is highly anisotropic (Figure

versus temperature.

S4 of the Supporting Information). The lowest expansion

coeﬃcient for CoZrF6 (αl ∼ −3 ppm·K−1) occurs at ∼400 K,

but at ∼−9

this temperature, ppm·K−1. Diﬀuse

the corresponding scattering in a

value for CaZrF6 is single-crystal X-ray

photograph of CoZrF6 at 300 K24 suggests that the cubic phase

contains local distortions away from the ideal ReO3-type

structure, which could make positive contributions to the

thermal expansion. At 400 K, the diﬀerence in expansion

between CoZrF6 and CaZrF6 presumably arises because the potentials underlying the lattice vibrations of these materials are

diﬀerent; the observed distortion to lower symmetry on cooling

implies that cubic CoZrF6 has a potential with multiple minima for some distortion coordinates, but CaZrF6 does not. We

believe that the highly ionic bonding in CaZrF6, when compared to CoZrF6, plays an important role in stabilizing its cubic structure against distortion, even at very low temper-
atures, as such a distortion brings ions of the same charge closer
together. 3.3. Behavior of CaZrF6 at High Pressure. The behavior
of NTE materials upon compression is of practical and
fundamental importance. If used in composites, NTE materials
experience stresses because of thermal expansion mismatch that
can change physical properties and even cause phase transitions.37,38 The same mode softening on volume reduction that gives rise to negative Grüneisen parameters, and hence NTE, can also ultimately lead to structural phase transitions on
compression. Consequently, many NTE materials display rich
behavior on compression; crystal-to-crystal phase transitions at <1 GPa are common, and some materials amorphize.39
Like many NTE materials, CaZrF6 is sensitive to stress but, unlike ScF3, does not undergo a simple displacive cubic to rhombohedral symmetry-lowering phase transition on compression.14 Measurements in a DAC at room temperature
(Figure 5) show the onset of a phase transition at around 400
MPa that leads to a low crystallinity, or amorphous, material
that persists on decompression. As both calcium and zirconium
often occur with higher coordination numbers than in cubic
CaZrF6, the loss of long-range order may be associated with an increase in coordination number. An analysis of the diﬀraction
data recorded in a DAC below 400 MPa indicates that cubic CaZrF6 is elastically soft, with a bulk modulus of ∼36 GPa at ∼300 K. This value is lower than that estimated in our ab initio calculations (∼51 GPa), but the diﬀerence could arise in part because the ﬁrst-principles estimate does not take into account the eﬀects of temperature, and some NTE materials are known to show considerable softening on heating.40
Most materials stiﬀen on compression, as the increase in
density leads to enhanced repulsions between atoms, and soften on heating. However, ZrW2O841 and Zn(CN)242 are known to display pressure-induced softening, resulting in negative values for the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, K0′. In the case of Zn(CN)2, this phenomenon is temperature-dependent.43 As recent work suggests that temperature-dependent pressureinduced softening may be common among NTE materials44 and that it is intimately tied to their NTE,45 the eﬀects of
temperature and pressure on the bulk modulus of CaZrF6 were explored over the range 298−514 K and pressures <0.31 GPa. A series of straight-line ﬁts to the resulting pressure/volume data, over the range 50−310 MPa, indicate thermal softening,
with the average bulk moduli dropping from 37 to 34 GPa
between 298 and 514 K. There is a corresponding small
increase in the magnitude of the NTE on compression, with αl(298−514 K) changing from −9.2 ppm·K−1 at 50 MPa to −9.9 ppm·K−1 at 310 MPa. An examination of the change in volume
on compression at 298 K suggests a softening (Figure S5a of the Supporting Information). A ﬁt using a third-order Birch− Murnaghan equation of state (EoS), with EoSFit7,46 to these
data resulted in estimates for the bulk modulus, K0, and its pressure derivative, K0′, of 42.1(8) GPa and −26(4), respectively. However, ﬁts to data from higher temperatures showed considerable scatter in the estimated K0′, presumably because of the limited pressure range of the experiment
combined with the uncertainties in the estimated pressures and volumes. To better control these uncertainties, a single ﬁt,
making simultaneous use of all available PVT data (Table S5 of the Supporting Information), to a third-order Birch−

pressure−temperature range examined. A 1-D version of the

ReO3 structure has been used to predict the behavior of K0′ in NTE solids.47

3.4. Moisture Stability. Many metal ﬂuorides are moisturereactive, including ZBLAN and related glass compositions.48

However, both IR spectroscopic measurements (Figure S6 of

the Supporting Information) and X-ray powder diﬀraction

experiments for CaZrF6 indicate that it can be handled in air.
Poor stability in the presence of moisture may limit the potential for application of some AIIBIVF6 compositions.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Highly ionic CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 remain cubic to very low temperatures and show very strong NTE over a wide
temperature range. This expansion behavior contrasts with
that of CoZrF6, which shows a symmetry-lowering phase transition on cooling. CaZrF6 and CaHfF6 are members of a large AIIBIVF6 family, providing for a detailed exploration of the chemical and structural factors controlling NTE, and many
opportunities for the design of controlled thermal expansion materials. As these ﬂuorides are optically transparent over a
wide wavelength range and can be fabricated in ceramic form,
the design of thermally stable IR optical components based on AIIBIVF6 compositions can be readily envisaged.
