Abstract

Heusler alloys have been intensively studied due to the wide variety of properties that they exhibit. One of these properties is of particular interest for technological applications, i.e., the fact that some Heusler alloys are half-metallic. In the following, a systematic study of the magnetic properties of three different Heusler families Co 2 Mn Z , Co 2 Fe Z , and Mn 2 V Z with Z = ( Al, Si, Ga, Ge ) is performed. A key aspect is the determination of the Gilbert damping from first-principles calculations, with special focus on the role played by different approximations, the effect that substitutional disorder and temperature effects. Heisenberg exchange interactions and critical temperature for the alloys are also calculated as well as magnon dispersion relations for representative systems, the ferromagnetic Co 2 Fe Si and the ferrimagnetic Mn 2 V Al . Correlation effects beyond standard density-functional theory are treated using both the local spin density approximation including the Hubbard U and the local spin density approximation plus dynamical mean field theory approximation, which allows one to determine if dynamical self-energy corrections can remedy some of the inconsistencies which were previously reported for these alloys.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

Subfigures (c) and (d) show the DOS when the systems and , respectively) are treated with . It can be seen that the half-metallicity of the materials can be affected by the shape of the potential and the choice of exchange correlation potential chosen.

In the case of FP-LSDA and the larger deviations are observed in the case of high energies, with the DMFT curve having a lower maximum than the LSDA results. In (b) a comparison of the adiabatic magnon spectra (solid lines) with the dynamical structure factor at , when the shape of the potential is considered to be given by the atomic sphere approximation and the exchange correlation potential to be given by LSDA, some softening can be observed due to temperature effects specially observed at higher points.

    Adiabatic magnon dispersion relation for when different exchange correlation potentials are considered. In general only a shift in energy is observed when considering LSDA or GGA with the overall shape being conserved.

    Temperature dependence of the Gilbert damping for for different exchange correlation potentials. For LSDA, GGA, and exchange correlation potentials the damping increases with temperature, whilst for the damping decreases as a function of temperature.

    Gilbert damping for different Heusler alloys at as a function of density of states at the Fermi energy for LSDA exchange correlation potential. In general the damping increases as the density of states at the Fermi energy increases (the dotted line is to guide the eyes).
