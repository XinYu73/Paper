Abstract

Two of the most popular generalized gradient approximations used in the applications of the density functional theory, PW91 and PBE, are generally regarded as essentially equivalent. They produce similar numerical results for many simple properties, such as lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies. We examine more complex properties of systems with electronic surface regions, with the specific application of the monovacancy formation energies of Pt and Al. A surprisingly large and consistent discrepancy between PBE and PW91 results is obtained. This shows that despite similarities found between some simple material properties, PBE and PW91 are not equivalent . The differences obtained for the monovacancy formation energies are related to differences in surface intrinsic errors which are substantiated using the idealized, well-controlled, jellium surface model. In view of the differences obtained with the PW91 and PBE functionals we develop separate surface intrinsic error corrections for these and revisit some earlier results.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

While one can be certain that the data is not more accurate than this, actual errors are likely larger. We use the interpolation/extrapolation formula of Ref. for the values of .
