Half-metallic TiF3: a potential anode material for Liion spin batteries
Junru Wang,a Feng Li,ab Bo Yang,a Xiaobiao Liua and Mingwen Zhao *a
As a key component of spintronic devices, spin batteries that can generate spin-polarized current are drawing increasing interests. Herein, we propose a simple strategy for spin batteries by introducing a half-metallic anode material in the conventional Li-ion batteries. Using ﬁrst-principles calculations, we demonstrate a potential half-metallic anode material, TiF3 crystal, which has stable ferromagnetism and half-metallicity under Li insertion. Low Li diﬀusion barriers (0.16–0.37 eV) and moderate Li storage capacity (256 mA h gÀ1) are revealed in the TiF3 crystal. The combination of half-metals and Li-ion battery oﬀers a new solution for spin batteries.

Introduction
As an indispensable part of the modern society, high performance rechargeable batteries, e.g. lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), are drawing increasing interests.1,2 LIBs are composed of a cathode, an anode and the electrolyte between them. Electrode materials are quite crucial for the properties of LIBs, such as life cycle, storage capacity, and charging/discharging rates. Compared with cathodes, the development of the anode materials has not been satisfactory to date; i.e. the performance of LIBs is largely determined by the anode materials.3–6 Ideal anode materials should have good conductivity, low Li diﬀusion barriers, high storage capacity, high stability, etc. Numerous materials have been proposed as promising anode materials with good performance, such as graphene and related systems,7–9 transition-metal dichalcogenides (MoS2),10 transition-metal carbides (Ti3C2),11 metal nitrides,12 MXenes,13 phosphorene14 and so on.15,16 Notably, all known anode materials are nonmagnetic, where the electron spin eﬀects are not included.
Spintronics, based on the manipulation of the intrinsic spin of electrons and its associated magnetic moments in addition to its fundamental electron charge, has been a long standing subject since the 1980s17–19 due to its promising applications such as information storage, transportation and processing. Half-metals, a class of materials that behave as a metal in one spin direction and an insulator in the opposite spin direction, are ideal for spintronics applications, as it can lter the current into a single spin channel. To this day, a number of materials with half-metallicity have been proposed, such as chromium

dioxide,20 transition metal doped dilute magnetic semiconductors,21 sp half-metallic ferromagnets,22–25 Heusler compounds,17,26–29 and magnetic perovskites.30 However, none of them is implementable for the anode of Li-ion batteries because the intrinsic voids in these materials are not large enough to host Li ions. The only exception is CrO2,20 but the half-metallicity is lost aer Li intercalation.
An interesting question naturally arises: are there halfmetallic anode materials suitable for LIBs? If a half-metallic anode is introduced into LIBs, the spin-lter ability of halfmetals may oﬀer a promising solution for the long-desired spin batteries. In this study, on the basis of rst-principles calculations, we propose for the rst time a potential halfmetallic anode material, TiF3 crystal, which has been synthesized in experiments.31,32 We demonstrated that the TiF3 crystal has robust ferromagnetism and half-metallicity under Li insertion. The diﬀusion barrier of Li ions in the TiF3 crystal is about 0.16–0.37 eV, implying the high Li mobility and thus high charging/discharging rates. The Li storage capacity in the TiF3 crystal is about 256 mA h gÀ1, comparable to that of most of the LIBs. Because the TiF3 crystal represents a large family of materials,33–35 it is expected that the present ndings can shed light on a new way to develop LIBs involving electron spinpolarization.
Computational methods
Our rst-principles calculations were performed within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), which is implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package known as VASP.36 The electron–ion interactions were described by projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potentials.37 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke– Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted for the exchange–correlation functional.38,39 The plane waves employed to expand the Kohn–

Sham electron wavefunction have an energy cutoﬀ of 520 eV. Structural optimizations were carried out using a conjugate gradient (CG) method without any symmetry until the maximum force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV A˚À1. The TiF3 crystal was modeled using a 2 Â 2 Â 2 supercell repeated periodically along the x-, y-, and z-directions. The Brillouin zone (BZ) integration was sampled on a 9 Â 9 Â 9 k-point grid.40 For the TiF3 nanosheet, a vacuum region of 20 A˚ was along the zdirections to avoid the interactions between neighboring images. In the spin-polarization calculations, diﬀerent initial spin congurations were adopted to get the magnetic moment of the ground state. Electron spin-polarization was taken into account throughout the calculations. The energetic minimal path proles for the Li diﬀusion were determined using a nudged elastic band (NEB) method.41,42
Results and discussion
A. Half-metallicity of ferromagnetic TiF3 crystal TiF3 crystal has a cubic lattice with a space group of pm3m. Ti atoms reside in the corners of the cubic lattice, while F atoms are at the edge centers, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Each Ti atom bonds to six F atoms, while each F atom is coordinated by two Ti atoms. The lattice constant, which is twice the Ti–F bond length, is about 3.933 A˚. The large voids in the center of the cubic lattice facilitate the accommodation and diﬀusion of small-size ions like lithium.33,43–45
The electronic band structure of the TiF3 crystal was then calculated. It is found that the TiF3 crystal has a spin-polarized ground state with signicant spin-splitting of about 1.0 eV, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The half-metallicity of the TiF3 crystal is quite evident. The Fermi level crosses the bands of one spin channel, leading to abundant electronic states at the Fermi level, whereas a large band gap of about 5.478 eV appears in the opposite spin channel. The bands in the proximity of the Fermi

level are rather dispersive in the momentum space, suggesting
good conductivity of the conducting spin channel. We also employed a large supercell (2 Â 2 Â 2) to investigate
the possible spin congurations of the TiF3 crystal. Starting from diﬀerent initial spin congurations, self-consistent
calculations give six types of magnetic orderings, as shown in
Fig. 2(a). It is found that the ferromagnetic (FM) ordering is energetically the most favorable. The energies of the ve anti-
ferromagnetic (AFM) orderings relative to the FM ordering are listed in Fig. 2(a). The smallest energy diﬀerence (DE) between FM and AFM is about À30 meV per unit cell. The FM state has magnetic moments of 1 mB in one unit cell, residing at the Ti ions. This is reasonable because the Ti atom in the TiF3 crystal is at the +3 state with one unpaired electron in each Ti.
The origins of the electron spin-polarization were revealed
from the electron density of states (DOS) analysis. Fig. 2(b)
and(c) gives the total DOS (TDOS) and the DOS projected onto diﬀerent atomic orbitals (PDOS) of the ferromagnetic TiF3 crystal. The half-metallicity of the TiF3 crystal is quite obvious from the TDOS. The abundant electronic states of one spin
channel in the proximity of the Fermi level arise mainly from
the dxy, dyz and dxz orbitals of Ti ions with a small contribution from the p orbital of F. This is in good consistency with the symmetry of the TiF3 crystal. The Ti3+ ion resides in the center of the octahedron of the nearest F atoms. According to the crystal eld theory, the ve d orbitals of Ti3+ ion in a octahedral crystal eld split into a three-fold degenerate eg orbital (dxy, dyz and dxz) and doubly-degenerate t2g (dz2 and dz2–y2) orbital. The eg orbital is lower in energy than t2g. Therefore, the unpaired electron in Ti3+ occupies the three-fold degenerated eg and contributes magnetic moments of 1 mB. The overlap between Ti_eg and F_p orbitals facilitates the p–d hybridization as well as the superexchange between Ti3+ ions.
The energetic favorability of the FM ordering in the TiF3 crystal can be interpreted in terms of a super-exchange mechanism,46–48 as elucidated in Fig. 2(e). The three-fold degenerate eg orbital of Ti3+ ion doesn't reach the half of electron

occupation, while the FÀ ion connecting two Ti3+ ions has a closed 2p shell. According to the Goodenough–Kanamori rules,46–48 the FÀ with closed 2p shell mediates a FM ordering of the Ti3+ ions, which is conrmed by our rst-principles calculations.
B. The half-metallicity and ferromagnetism of TiF3 under Li insertion For a potential anode material for LIBs, the electronic structure modication in response to Li insertion, particularly the stability of the half-metallicity, is quite crucial. We investigated the electronic structures of TiF3 with diﬀerent Li concentrations. We rst placed a single Li atom in a 2 Â 2 Â 2 supercell of TiF3, corresponding to a stoichiometry of Li0.125TiF3. Structural optimization showed that the inserted Li atom prefers the center of the FÀ square on the {001} planes, as shown in Fig. 3(a), rather than the cubic center. The energy diﬀerence between the two sites is À48.5 meV per unit cell. This is related to the coulomb attraction between Li+ and FÀ ions. The formation energy of Li0.125TiF3 determined by the diﬀerence between the total energy of Li0.125TiF3, and the sum of the total energies of TiF3 and bulk Li crystal is about À0.995 eV per Li. The negative formation energy indicates that the Li atom prefers to insert into TiF3 rather than clustering. Bader analysis shows that about 0.87 electrons transfer from Li atom to TiF3.
The spin-resolved DOS of the TiF3 crystal at this Li concentration is plotted in Fig. 3(a). It is evident that the halfmetallicity remains intact under Li insertion. We also calculated the energy diﬀerence between FM and AFM ordering and found that it is enhanced to À72 meV per unit cell, implying that the stability of ferromagnetism of the TiF3 crystal is improved by Li insertion.
As the Li concentration is increased to LiTiF3, corresponding to eight Li ions in a 2 Â 2 Â 2 supercell, more electrons transfer to the TiF3 crystal, pushing the Fermi level upwards to the conduction band region of the semiconducting channel, as shown in Fig. 3(b). However, highly-spin-polarized current could also be expected because the electronic states near the Fermi level arise mainly from the conductive spin channel. The FM ordering remains energetically most favorable, but the

energy diﬀerence between FM and AFM ordering decreases to À41 meV per unit cell.
C. Li diﬀusion barriers and storage capacity
The diﬀusion energy prole of a Li atom between two steady states (face centers) was determined using the CNEB strategy. For Li0.125TiF3, the energy barrier was calculated to be about 0.37 eV with the transition state (TS) residing at the Ti cubic center. When the Li concentration increases to Li0.875TiF3, corresponding to seven Li ions in a 2 Â 2 Â 2 supercell, the potential barrier decreases to only 0.16 eV. The face center in this case is still the energy minimum site. The Li diﬀusion barriers in TiF3 are much lower than those in silicon (0.57 eV)49 and phosphorene categories (0.76 eV)50 and comparable to that in graphene (0.33 eV),8 implying high Li mobility and thus high charging/discharging rates.
We also evaluated the energy barrier of intercalating a Li atom from the surface to the interiors of TiF3 using a slab model of a TiF3 nanosheet. The energetically most preferable site for Li atom on the TiF3 nanosheet remains to be the face center. As the Li atom enters the interiors of the TiF3 nanosheet from the surface, it should experience an energy barrier of 0.37 eV. Such a low energy barrier implies that Li atom is easy to enter the interior of TiF3. The energy barrier is lower than that of Cu3N (0.81 eV).33 From the interior of TiF3 to the surface, however, Li ion should overcome an energy barrier of 0.48 eV as the interior face center is more stable than the surface face center by about 0.11 eV. This indicates that Li ion prefers to stay in the interior of TiF3 rather than on the surface.
Li storage capacity and the average open-circuit of bulk TiF3 are two key parameters that determine the performance of LIBs. The Li storage capacity can be evaluated from the formation energy (Eform) of the LixTiF3 dened as Eform ¼ ELixTiF3 À ETiF3 À xELi, where ELixTiF3 and ETiF3 represent the total energy of TiF3 with and without Li insertion, respectively, and ELi is the energy of a Li in bulk crystal. When 8 Li atoms are placed in the cubic centers of a 2 Â 2 Â 2 supercell, corresponding to a stoichiometry of LiTiF3, the formation energy is about À0.08 eV per Li. According to the denition of the formation energy, the negative formation energy indicates that Li can insert in TiF3 rather than clustering. The formation energy is lower than that of some typical anode materials, such as Nb2C (À0.02 eV per Li).51 In this Li concentration, the TiF3 lattice undergoes tensile strains of about 6.7% in the x- and y-directions and 2.3% in the z-direction, which are much smaller than the volume expansion of Si (310%) and Sn (260%) upon lithium insertion.52 We therefore took the stoichiometry of LiTiF3 as the maximum Li capacity in the TiF3 anode. The maximum theoretical capacities (C) of Li atom can be calculated by C ¼ xmaxF/MTiF3, where xmax is the maximum fraction of Li in LixTiF3, F represents the Faraday constant (26.8 A h molÀ1), and MTiF3 is the atomic mass of TiF3 (104.86 g molÀ1). The maximum capacity is evaluated to be 256 mA h gÀ1. The capacity is comparable to those of the nonmagnetic electrode materials, TiO2 polymorphs (200 mA h gÀ1),53 GeS (256 mA h gÀ1),16 and MoS2/graphene (338 mA h gÀ1).10

Because the charge/discharge processes of TiF3 follow the half-cell reaction vs. Li/Li+: Li1ÀxTiF3 + xLi + xeÀ 4 LixTiF3, the average open-circuit voltage (OCV) for Li intercalation can therefore be evaluated from the energy diﬀerence based on the
following equation:

where E[LixTiF3] is the total energy of the bulk TiF3 with inserted Li atoms, ELi is the energy of bulk Li crystal, and x1 and x2 represent the concentrations of Li atoms intercalated in bulk TiF3. Therefore, the average open-circuit voltage is 0.08 V. The average open-circuit voltage in TiF3 is much lower than those of TiO2 (1.5 V)53 and Cu3N (0.38 V)33 and comparable to that of graphene (0.10 V).7 The lower the anodal open-circuit voltage, the higher the output voltage of the battery, which is benecial to the application of battery.
We evaluated the energy density (3M) of the Li-ion spin battery by taking the ePﬀects of cathode into account using the equation 3M ¼ ÀnFE/ Mi, where n is the amount of electron transfer, F is the Faraday constant, E is equilibrium potential, and Mi is the molar mass of anode and cathode materials. The cathode material (LiCoO2) used in LIBs has the average voltage of 3.8 V and the capacity of 140 mA h gÀ1.54 To match with the cathode, the mass ratio between the anode and the cathode was taken as 0.547, which gave the energy density of 337 mW h gÀ1. This value is larger than the energy density (265 mW h gÀ1) achieved recently in the Li-ion battery.54 In addition, the halfmetallic anode lters the current into a single spin channel without needing half-metallic features of the cathode, provided that the spin is preserved in the whole circuit.
D. Thermal stability of the ferromagnetism of the Liinserted TiF3 crystal
We investigated the thermal stability of ferromagnetism of the TiF3 crystal with inserted Li ions using the Ising model. Without external X eld, the Hamiltonian of the Ising model is written as H^ ¼ ÀJ0 m^ im^ j, where m^ i and m^ j are the magnetic moments at
ij
the sites i and j, respectively, and J0 is the exchange parameter. For the TiF3 crystal, the value of J0 can be determined using the formula J0 ¼ DE/16m2, where DE is the energy diﬀerence between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states, and DE ¼ EFM À EAFM. For Li0.125TiF3, J0 was evaluated to be 4.5 meV, and the possible values of m^ were taken as À1 and 1. Based on these parameters, we investigated the thermal stability of the FM states using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We employed a 30 Â 30 Â 30 supercell containing 2.7 Â 104 local magnetic moments. The simulations lasted for 1 Â 108 loops. In each loop, the spins on all the sites in the supercell changed according to the spin states of Ti, yielding 2.7 Â 1012 trials during the simulations. The spin was changed when DH # 0 or random number x < exp(DH/kT) is satised, where DH is the energy diﬀerence between the reversed spin state and initial state. The total energy of the system at each state was calculated using the Ising model. We obtained the magnetic moments as

a function of temperature, as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed

that the magnetic moments per unit cell rapidly fall to 0.0 mB

when the temperature is greater than 238 K, which indicates

that the system undergoes a transition from ferromagnetic

conguration (FM) to a paramagnetic conguration (PM) with

an increase in temperature. To clarify the ferromagnetic–para-

magnetic transition, we calculated the heat capacity (CV) of the

system

using

the

expression:

where

DET

is

the

change in the total energy of the system as the temperature is

increased from T to T + DT. The calculated CV as a function of temperature is shown in the inset of Fig. 4. It is obvious that the

Curie temperature (TC) is 238 K, and the ferromagnetic–paramagnetic transition is a second order transition. We also eval-

uated the Curie temperatures of LixTiF3 (x ¼ 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0) using the same strategy and found that they are 141 K, 85 K and

97 K, respectively. These Curie temperatures are higher than the

temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K) and can thus be easily

achieved in experiments.

Finally, we should state that we only show an idea of Li-ion

spin batteries in this work. Some complicated processes, such

as spin injection and possible substitution reaction between Li

and Ti atoms, have not been taken into account, and they are

the objectives of the following studies.

Conclusions
Using rst-principles calculations, we propose a potential halfmetallic anode material for LIBs where the intrinsic electron spins are involved. We demonstrated that the TiF3 crystal has not only robust ferromagnetism against Li insertion but also low energy barrier (0.16–0.37 eV) for Li diﬀusion. The Li storage capacity (256 mA h gÀ1) and the average electrode potential (0.08 V) are comparable to those of the nonmagnetic anode materials. The combination of the half-metal with LIBs may oﬀer a promising solution for long-desired spin batteries in spintronics.
