abstract
This review focuses on the field of quantum entanglement applied to condensed matter physics systems with strong correlations, a domain which has rapidly grown over the last decade. By tracing out part of the degrees of freedom of correlated quantum systems, useful and non-trivial information can be obtained through the study of the reduced density matrix, whose eigenvalue spectrum (the entanglement spectrum) and the associated Rényi entropies are now well recognized to contain key features. In particular, the celebrated area law for the entanglement entropy of ground-states will be discussed from the perspective of its subleading corrections which encode universal details of various quantum states of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or topological order. Going beyond entropies, the study of the low-lying part of the entanglement spectrum also allows to diagnose topological properties or give a direct access to the excitation spectrum of the edges, and may also raise significant questions about the underlying entanglement Hamiltonian. All these powerful tools can be further applied to shed some light on disordered quantum systems where impurity/disorder can conspire with quantum fluctuations to induce nontrivial effects. Disordered quantum spin systems, the Kondo effect, or the many-body localization problem, which have all been successfully (re)visited through the prism of quantum entanglement, will be discussed in detail. Finally, the issue of experimental access to entanglement measurement will be addressed, together with its most recent developments.

1. Introduction
The ‘‘spooky’’ nature of quantum entanglement has been a subject of several and intense debates since the early days of quantum mechanics [1,2]. At first attached to fundamental questions regarding the formulation and the foundations of quantum mechanics, in particular after Bell’s theorem [3,4], the concept of entanglement has recently generated an enormous interest in several communities [5–15], e.g. atomic physics and quantum optics, condensed matter, mathematical physics, high energy physics, quantum information and quantum cryptography, cosmology, etc.
Shortly after the seminal works of Bennett and co-workers [5] on quantum teleportation, the study of entanglement in condensed matter model systems has strongly benefited from the rapid development of quantum information [16,17]. Built at the interface of quantum information science, condensed matter theory, statistical physics, quantum field theory, the study of many-body entangled states rapidly has become a very active topic, in particular triggered by the discovery that entanglement could serve as a new smoking gun for quantum critical phenomena [18–21]. In parallel, numerical approaches for quantum many-body systems have also taken advantage of such progresses, with the impressive development of very efficient variational techniques such as matrix-product-state and tensor network methods [22–25].
The framework of quantum entanglement for condensed matter physics is nowadays very wide, and this topic has certainly acquired now a robust and mature status. It is therefore quite ambitious and perhaps illusory to pretend giving an exhaustive overview. Consequently, some aspects of quantum entanglement in condensed matter systems will not be discussed here. For instance, we will not address multipartite entanglement, focusing on the bipartite case, as exemplified
in Fig. 1 for a two-dimensional (d = 2) system. In such a case, assuming |Ψ ⟩ is a pure state defined over degrees of freedom

will be the main targets of this overview. In the first part (Section 2), after recalling important results in one dimension, the celebrated area law for the ground-state
entanglement entropy will be briefly discussed, before focusing on sub-leading correcting terms which carry universality for various quantum states of matter, broken symmetries and topological properties. In Section 3, entanglement spectroscopy results will be presented for a large variety of low-dimensional correlated ground-states, e.g. gapped and gapless spin chains and ladders, topological ordered phases such as fractional quantum Hall states or spin liquids, broken continuous symmetry states such as superfluids. Disorder quantum systems will then be considered in Section 4, focusing on three important cases. First we address ground-state entanglement for disordered quantum spin models and Kondo impurity problems. Then the many-body localization of excited states will be discussed through entanglement features. Finally, Section 5 will address the crucial issue of experimental detection and measure of entanglement. Finally, conclusions and some open questions will be listed in Section 6.

2. The area law, and beyond

Originally studied by Bombelli et al. [30], Srednicki [31], Callan and Wilczek [32], Holzhey et al. [33] in the context of black-hole physics [34], the geometric, or entanglement entropy in the ground-state of a free scalar bosonic field is well-known to obey the so-called area law, i.e. in dimension d it scales with the surface of the subsystem A:

Sq(A) = aqLd−1 + · · · .

(2.1)

In this part, we first focus on one dimensional systems, and then discuss higher dimensions, in particular the corrections (the ellipses in Eq. (2.1)) beyond the area-law.

2.1. One dimension

2.1.1. Entanglement entropy
For one dimensional quantum systems, one has to make a distinction between critical and non-critical ground-states.
Indeed, strictly speaking the area law Eq. (2.1) for d = 1 yields a constant entropy, independent of the subsystem size. As
first observed by Calabrese and Cardy [21], and then proved by Hastings [35] this always occurs for non-critical ground-states having a finite correlation length. This is exemplified in Fig. 2(a) where we show exact diagonalization results obtained for
the dimerized quantum spin-1/2 chain model

(2.2)

This system (studied by several authors, see for instance Ref. [20]), equivalent to a free-fermion problem after a
Jordan–Wigner transformation [36], has a gap above its short-range correlated dimerized ground-state for any δ ̸= 0 [37],

1 Other types of bipartitions (momentum or orbital) will also be discussed, see Section 3. Let us also mention the particle-partitioning [26], and also the notion of ‘‘field space entanglement’’ between different fields, studied by several authors [27–29].

and is critical with power-law decaying correlations in the absence of modulation δ = 0. The uniform part of the von Neumann (q = 1) entanglement entropy is plotted against the subsystem length ℓA for increasing dimerization strengths in Fig. 2(a) where we clearly see that S1 gets saturated to a constant ∼ ln ξ (where ξ is the finite correlation length), as expected for d = 1 with short-range correlations [35,38]. In such a case, corrections beyond the area law are universal [39,
40], which have been also checked numerically [41].
On the other hand, critical chains described by conformal field theory (CFT) [21,33,43] display a logarithmic violation of
the strict area law, as Rényi entropies grow with the subsystem length ℓA following the universal form

for periodic chains of length L, where c is the central charge of the CFT. The constant term sq is non-universal but can be evaluated exactly in some cases [42], see Fig. 2(b). The ellipses in Eq. (2.3) represent subleading corrections to scaling, vanishing as power-laws of the subsystem size involving the Luttinger liquid exponent [44–48]. Open boundary conditions, discussed in more detail below (see Section 4.2.3), also leads to finite size corrections to the above logarithmic scaling [49,50]. Interestingly, power-law decaying corrections can be used to estimate the Luttinger exponent [51,52]. For exactly solvable one-dimensional models with multicritical conformal points described by unitary minimal models and Zn para-fermions, see also [53]. Finally, note that finite temperature corrections can also be computed using CFT [21,54,55].

2.1.2. Beyond bipartite entropy Despite the huge interest and the very large amount of works focused on bipartite entanglement entropies in one
dimension, let us also mention a few other many-body measures of entanglement.

2.1.2.1. Entanglement entropy of disjoint intervals. Several authors have considered how to estimate the amount of
entanglement between disjoint intervals using CFT [56–64]. In the case of two intervals A ∪ B = [x1A, x2A] ∪ [x1B, x2B],
as depicted in Fig. 3, CFT results lead to

where Fq is a universal function which depends on the compactification radius (related to the Luttinger parameter) of the underlying CFT. Some results have also been obtained in higher dimension [65] and for random spin chains [66].

2.1.2.2. Entanglement negativity. Another interesting quantity is the entanglement negativity [67,68], defined for any

(possibly mixed) state ρ

where

ρ

is the partial transpose of ρ

with respect to subsystem A, and ∥ · ∥1

is the trace norm. The logarithmic negativity [69] EN (ρ) = log2 ∥ρTA ∥1, is used more often as a measure of entanglement

for thermal states, as well as for disjoint intervals.

CFT approaches for the negativity have been successfully used for ground-states [70,71], at finite temperature [72], or

out-of-equilibrium [73]. Numerically, Monte Carlo schemes have also been proposed to estimate EN [74,75]. Note moreover that the negativity has been proven useful to detect topological order [76,77] (see also Sections 2.5.1 and 3.2), as well as in

the context of the Kondo effect [78,79] (see also Section 4.2).

2.2. The area law in higher dimension
In this section, we simply give a short survey of this topic, which has been recently reviewed in a thorough way by Eisert, Cramer, and Plenio [13].

2.2.1. d > 1 fermions
Conventional metals, described as free fermions or Fermi liquids are known to weakly violate the area law by a multiplicative logarithmic correction [80–84] if there is a well-defined Fermi surface, while for non-critical fermions the entropy obeys a strict area law. This logarithmic enhancement can be related to the topology of the Fermi surface [81,85–87] through

where nx and nk are units normal to the real space boundary Ax and the Fermi surface Ak. One can also understand such a weak violation of the area law using a low-energy description of the Fermi surface like an ensemble of one dimensional gapless modes, as proposed by Swingle [86,88]. A multidimensional bosonization approach gives essentially similar results for Fermi liquids [89].
Another very interesting result for free fermions came with the seminal works by Klich and co-workers on quantum noise [90,91]. They found a direct link between entanglement entropies and the fluctuations of a globally conserved quantity within a subsystem, for instance the particle number for Fermi gases or the subsystem magnetization for quantum magnets. This has motivated a large number of subsequent studies [92–103]. Remarkably, using the full counting statistics [104] there is an exact expression for all Rényi entropies [95]. This is further discussed below in Section 5.1.1.
Particle number fluctuations and entanglement entropies have also been explored in the context of ultracold Fermi gases [96,100,105,106]. Note also that in a similar context, connections to random matrix theory have been recently discussed [101,107–109] to obtain analytic expressions in various regimes of a one dimensional gas confined by a harmonic trap.
On the numerical side, recent progresses have also been made using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques for accessing entanglement properties of interacting fermions [110–118]. In particular, emergent fermions (spinons) with a Fermi surface have been detected through the logarithmic enhancement of the area law in a critical quantum spin liquid state using variational Monte Carlo [110]. Nevertheless, a relatively unexplored field concerns non-Fermi liquids for which Swingle and Senthil argued for a similar logarithmically enhanced area law [119]. Using a variational Monte Carlo approach
the composite fermion wave function [120] for half-filled Landau level ν = 1/2, a non-Fermi liquid state, has been shown
to indeed exhibit a logarithmically enhanced area law, but with a prefactor twice larger [121]. Another interesting example is the Bose metal state, the so-called exciton Bose liquid [122] which displays a ‘‘Bose
surface’’ with gapless excitations, for which a logarithmic enhancement of the area law was found [123,124]. Let us finally mention that free fermions in a weak random potential, but still in a metallic (diffusive) regime, loose
logarithmic enhancement and obey a strict area law for the mean entropy [125–127]. This can be understood from the smearing of the sharp Fermi surface by disorder, despite a finite density of gapless states [126].

2.2.2. Non-interacting bosons
We now turn to the case of non-interacting bosonic models. In contrast with the free fermions case, free bosons with non-relativistic quadratic dispersion display Bose–Einstein condensation. In this context, the area law term is suppressed, and the dominant scaling of the Rényi entropy is logarithmic with the number of particles [74,128]. This situation is somehow unphysical, and can be understood as a mean-field limit for which we do not expect a well-defined ‘‘area’’. Below we will see in Section 2.4 that any interaction will restore the area law term, while additional logarithmic corrections associated to Nambu–Goldstone modes are expected.
For a relativistic free bosonic field theory, which is equivalent to a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, Rényi entropies
scale with the area in dimension d > 1 [30–32,129–132]. This was clearly confirmed numerically for critical and non-critical

regimes where, contrary to free fermions, a strict area law is observed in both cases [83,133]. Numerical evaluation for lattice quadratic Hamiltonians is made possible using Wick’s theorem, as shown by Chung and Peschel [134,135].

2.3. Corrections to the area law for various states of matter

2.3.1. State of the art
The area law term discussed above does not a priori carry information regarding a given phase of matter. Nevertheless, it has been shown to display critical behavior when a quantum phase transition is crossed, developing a local extremum at
a critical point g = gc [136–140], with the area-law prefactor aq(gc ) − aq(g) ∝ |g − gc |ν(d−1), where ν is the correlation
length exponent associated to the critical point. Fig. 4 shows such cusp singularities for O(3) [139] and O(2) [140] quantum critical points. This singular behavior is natural if one interprets the entropy as a surface or boundary free energy [141].
Going beyond the leading area law term, universal signatures are expected for various quantum phases of matter. The
first discussed and celebrated example is for (1 + 1) CFT which describes critical interacting d = 1 quantum chains
[20,21,54], with the logarithmic growth Eq. (2.3) involving the central charge c of the underlying CFT. In higher dimension, several authors have studied the problem which turns out to be much richer [136,138,139,141–154].
In Table 1, we give a simplified overview of different quantum states of matter with their associated entanglement entropy scalings, and physical examples of realizations. Generally speaking, ordered states can be classified into three main families. For discrete symmetry breaking, a trivial additive constant depending only on the degeneracy of the ground-state
is expected ln(deg) [143]. In the case of continuous symmetry breaking, e.g. U(1) for superfluids or SU(2) for Heisenberg
antiferromagnets, additional logarithmic corrections due to Nambu–Goldstone modes are present [147,155], as we discuss in detail below in Section 2.4. For topological ordered phases, there is a negative constant [156,157], as will be discussed in Section 2.5. At quantum critical points, for instance O(N), an additive constant appears [136]. Note also the numerical study
on cubic subsystems for the d = 3 quantum Ising model [158].

2.3.2. Corner contributions in dimension d = 2
We first focus on the issue of subsystems having non-smooth boundaries with the particular example of sharp corners in two dimensions which are responsible for additive logarithmic corrections to the area law, as studied in several works [138,139,141,145,151,152,160–168]. The area law is indeed corrected as follows

where the sum is taken over sharp corner angles. With smooth boundaries, such a logarithmic divergence occurs only for odd dimensions [10,169]. For even values of d, sharp angles lead to logarithmic corrections which are expected to be universal
for all systems with the same type of symmetry breaking/phase transition. In d = 2 it has been studied in several situations, such as CFT, or Lifshitz with z ̸= 1, where the prefactor was shown to be directly proportional to the central charge [141]. For free scalar field theory, Casini and Huerta have provided an analytical solution [160] for integer q ≥ 2 while it involves a tricky numerical solution of a set of non-linear differential equations, valid for ϕc ∈ [0, π ] (lq(ϕ) = lq(2π − ϕ)). Below in
Fig. 5 we show numerical results obtained in Ref. [163] for non-interacting relativistic bosons on a square lattice, reproducing the free scalar field results of Casini and Huerta.
In order to extract the corner corrections, we study square subsystems (having 4 corners, each with ϕ = π /2) of perimeter 2L (embedded in a L × L torus) at which one subtracts the entropies from corner-free strips ℓ × L having the
same perimeter so that the area law contribution cancels, as well as other potential corrections (e.g. Goldstone modes for continuous symmetry breakings, see also below in Section 2.4).
Working with spin-wave (SW) corrections of an SU(2) model [163], there are two Nambu–Goldstone modes from which we expect the leading term of this difference to be given by

Sqsquare − Sqstrip = 8lq(π /2) ln L + · · · .

(2.7)

Numerical diagonalization results of the non-interacting SWs Hamiltonian [163] are plotted in Fig. 5 where we clearly
see that the above difference Eq. (2.7) is clearly dominated by a logarithmic scaling which allows us to extract lq(π /2).
Small variations of the results for different aspects ratios of the strips (see left and right panels of Fig. 5) can be used as a measure of the error due to finite size effects and fitting procedure. Our results, in perfect agreement with those of Casini and Huerta [160], are displayed in Table 2 together with other estimates for interacting field theories obtained from numerical simulations using series expansion [170], numerical linked cluster expansion [138,151,152] or QMC [171]. Note that extracting such small log corrections is very challenging for interacting fixed points and series or numerical linked cluster expansion turns out to be more controlled than QMC for this task.
The fact that universality emerges in the corner logarithmic terms is remarkable. It was then proposed that the prefactor of the logarithmic correction is an effective measure of the degrees of freedom of the underlying CFT [151,160,169]. Using

CFT and holographic calculations, Bueno and co-workers have suggested that the ratio l1(ϕ)/CT is universal for a broad
range of CFT, meaning almost the same for all CFTs, including Wilson–Fisher fixed points of the O(N) model [162,164,165]
(see Fig. 6), where CT is the central charge of the stress tensor correlator. In the smooth limit ϕ → π , it was conjectured [162,164] and then proved [168] that for all CFTs l1(ϕ → π ) = (π − ϕ)2CT (π 2/24). Beyond the smooth limit, l1(ϕ)/CT slightly deviates for different theories (see Fig. 6). A lower bound for general lq(ϕ) was also derived recently by Bueno and
Witczak-Krempa [167], and is shown in Fig. 6.
Estimates for this ratio are shown in Table 2 for q = 1 and ϕ = π /2, using the central charge from conformal bootstrap [172], which all satisfy the lower bound of 1.14 [167]. Beyond the von Neumann index at q > 1, CT should be replaced by hq/(q − 1) [165], with hq the scaling dimension of the twist operator.2
Finally, we can also investigate the Rényi index dependence for non-integer values of q. In Fig. 7 we report numerical
linked expansions results for (a) O(2) [152] and (b) O(3) [151] together with different estimates for the Ising fixed point,
as well as our estimate for free scalar [163]. The non-trivial q-dependences are qualitatively similar, and the ratio between
O(2) and O(1) is well compatible with 2, as well as for O(3) with a factor 3.

2.4. Continuous symmetry breaking

For condensed matter systems presenting a spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry at zero temperature in the thermodynamic limit, such as Bose-condensed superfluids or ordered antiferromagnets, additive logarithmic corrections
have been originally observed using modified SW theory [155] and numerical simulations [173] on d = 2 quantum
antiferromagnets. Shortly after, Metlitski and Grover [147] proposed an analytical interpretation based on quantum rotor and non-linear sigma models where both SW excitations and the ‘‘tower of states’’ (TOS) due to the symmetry restoration in a finite volume [174,175] are responsible for a logarithmic correction, proportional to the number of Nambu–Goldstone modes nG associated with the symmetry breaking, thus yielding

non-interacting SW [163] is shown (green line) for comparison. Note the difference in the estimates for Ising between the two panels, as commented in Ref.

2.4.1. Large s approach for d = 2

2.4.1.1. Logarithmic corrections due to Nambu–Goldstone modes. As developed in Refs. [155,163,176] for ordered phases where a continuous symmetry is broken, a SW (SW) treatment allows to capture subleading corrections in Eq. (2.8). A
canonical example is the so-called J1 − J2 spin-s antiferromagnet [177], governed on the square lattice by the Hamiltonian

When the external staggered field h = 0, this model exhibits Néel order with a spontaneous breaking of SU(2) symmetry in the thermodynamic limit at T = 0 if J2 < Jc (s) [177], with Jc → J1/2 for s ≫ 1. Replacing spin-s operators by Holstein–Primakoff bosonic deviations about the classically ordered moment allows to expand the above J1 − J2 model as H /s2 = Ecl. + H (2)/s + H (4)/s2 + · · · , where Ecl. is the classical energy of the ordered ground-state, H (2) is a quadratic Hamiltonian in terms of Holstein–Primakoff bosons, and H (4) is quartic. Truncating the above expansion at the quadratic (1/s) level usually captures most of the low-energy physics of quantum antiferromagnets [178], and we further expect better accuracy for s ≫ 1. Such a treatment leads to the quadratic bosonic model

SW framework, one can artificially proceed to a fictitious restoration by adjusting the staggered field h in Eq. (2.9) so that

the (SW-corrected) sublattice magnetization vanishes, following Refs. [179,180]. As discussed in Refs. [155,163,176], such

a (size-dependent) artificial staggered field has to scale as h∗

for L × L lattices in the large s limit. Interestingly, the

results for L × ℓ strip subsystems A (panel b) embedded in L × L tori, up to 600 × 6003 with a large spin length s = 100.
This plot shows that (i) the area law term does not depend on the aspect ratio of the subsystem, and (ii) the logarithmic
correction in Eq. (2.8) is precisely governed by the prefactor nG/2 = 1, independent of the Rényi index. The logarithmic corrections in Eq. (2.8) have been also captured within a similar SW formalism for d = 3 U(1) and SU(2) cases [182], and
also using a Schwinger boson formalism [140].

2.4.1.2. Universal additive constant γqord. In the case of d = 2 strip subsystems with an aspect ratio ℓ/L, Metlitski and

(J1 − 2J2), one can

extract γqord(ℓ/L) by fitting our numerical data to the above form Eq. (2.8), as displayed in Fig. 9 against the aspect ratio ℓ/L.

Results compare perfectly to those of Ref. [147] for Rényi q = 2. Universality is also confirmed by the fact that the results

do not depend on the value of the second neighbor couplings J2.

2.4.1.3. Connection to free scalar field theory. An attempt to directly connect this result to free scalar field theory has also

been made in Refs. [147,163]. On finite lattices, a diverging contribution from the zero mode has to be cut off by a small gap

in the relativistic spectrum [83]. For a free scalar field, a small mass leads to a logarithmic correction to the entanglement

2.4.2.1. Entanglement entropies. One of the most efficient numerical methods to diagnose continuous symmetry breaking in

the entanglement scaling for dimension d ≥ 2 is based on QMC sampling, in particular after the work of Hastings et al. [184].

Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) studies of d = 2 quantum spin or bosonic models where SU(2) [185,186]

or U(1) [74] symmetry may be broken are also available, but they did not focus on logarithmic corrections. The first QMC

attempts [139,173,187]

in the

entropy [147] have indeed found

a logarithmic

term for Heisenberg models, but estimated the prefactor in the range 0.5–0.8, which is smaller that the predicted value of

one (with nG = 2 for SU(2) symmetry).
More recently, Kulchytskyy et al. [183] have performed an improved measurement of the second Rényi entropy S2 for the
square lattice s = 1/2 XY model from which they could estimate both the log prefactor (here nG = 1 for U(1) symmetry), as well as the constant in Eq. (2.8) γ ord for lattice up to 32 × 32. Their results for both quantities, shown in Fig. 11 as a

function of the aspect ratio of the strip subsystem, appear to be in good agreement the analytical prediction of Metlitski and

Grover [147] as well as with the large-s prediction Eq. (2.15) form in Ref. [163].

In order to go beyond q = 2, building on the ratio trick proposed by Humeniuk and Roscilde [187] one can improve

the QMC estimate of Rényi (and also thermodynamic) entropies, as done in Ref. [188]. This method has been applied to the

above s = 1/2 J1 − J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice Eq. (2.9), for which studying the Rény entropies at q = 2, 3, 4 of the simplest corner-free subsystem – a periodic one-dimensional line (see Fig. 12) – allowed to capture

the logarithmic corrections with a prefactor close to unity, fully consistent with nG = 2 Goldstone bosons. The fact that
universality can be captured for such a simple linear subsystem reinforces the idea that entanglement is dominated by

boundary degrees of freedom.

2.4.2.2. Shannon–Rényi entropies. Spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry also appears in the (basis-dependent)

so-called ‘‘Shannon–Rényi’’ (SR) entropy computed in the ground-state of finite size systems. These wave-function entropies,

recently introduced in series of works by Stéphan and co-workers [143,146,189], and further studied by other groups

[190–198], can efficiently capture universal properties, e.g. Luttinger liquid physics, quantum criticality, symmetry breaking

phases.

problems such as the Anderson localization [199] where the SR entropy (related to the inverse participation ratio) does not

grows with the volume. However, as observed numerically using large scale QMC simulations [193], the first corrections to

such a volume law are logarithmic for SU(2) and U(1) broken phases. This is exemplified in Fig. 13 where QMC data [193] for

2.4.3. Summary and outlook
Relativistic Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with continuous symmetry breaking show up as logarithmic corrections in the Rényi entanglement entropies, as written in Eq. (2.8). This was clearly verified using large-s calculations, and QMC simulations for strip and line subsystems. Interestingly, the coefficients of the ground-state wave function expressed in a local computational basis also contain such a correction Eq. (2.17), as verified with large scale QMC.
Regarding the additive geometric content γord in Eq. (2.8), the discrepancy between the prediction of Metlitski and Grover and the large-s result Eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) remains to be understood. A QMC study for q > 2, while notoriously difficult,
could perhaps resolve this issue. Another potentially interesting check would be to study other continuous symmetry breaking states, such as SU(N) for instance using QMC [201] or flavor-wave theory [202]. Spin nematic ordered states [203] are also interesting exotic candidates where similar logarithmic corrections should occur.

2.5. Long-range entanglement in topologically ordered phases
The current understanding of topological ordered phases has benefited from intensive works during the past 25 years [204,205]. While a precise definition of topological order is still an active field of research [206], one can simply see it as a zero temperature disordered gapped state (i.e. with only short-range order of any local operators) which does not break any symmetry, and whose degeneracy is robust against local perturbations and depends on the topology of the space. This dependence implies that infinitely far boundaries can influence the ground-state properties, which seems to contradict the short-range nature of the correlations. Such a ‘‘robust hidden long-range structure’’ [207] has been diagnosed as ‘‘long-range entanglement’’ [208] (even though a topological ordered state is not necessarily more entangled than other states of matter).

2.5.1. Topological entanglement entropy
One of the simplest ways to characterize topological order relies on the entanglement entropy which displays a sub-leading constant beyond the conventional area law term, thus yielding

S = aLd−1 − γ ,

as first identified by Hamma et al. [209], Kitaev and Preskill [156], and Levin and Wen [157]. This topological entropy γ
is a universal number, characteristic of the topological order, which depends non-trivially on the quantum dimension of emergent quasi-particles above the degenerate ground-state [156,157]:

γ = ln D,

(2.19)

√

for the Moore–Read state [214] γ = ln 4m. A very useful interpretation of this topological constant has been proposed

by Stéphan and co-workers in a series of works [143,146,215] where they showed using CFT a correspondence between

entanglement entropies of d = 2 Rokhsar–Kivelson (RK) states and the (basis-dependent) Shannon–Rényi entropies

associated to the coefficient of the wave-function of spin chains models. An interesting example is the d = 2 eight-vertex

RK state [216] which has Z2 topological order, and corresponds to the Ising chain in transverse field in the ferromagnetic phase where the Shannon–Rényi entropies follow aL − ln 2.

2.5.2. Numerical results

2.5.2.1. Z2 spin liquids. Considered to be the smoking gun of topological order, non-zero topological entanglement entropy may be hard to measure in numerical simulations. A construction in real space was proposed [156,157] in order to cancel

boundary and corner effects and get a better access to γ . This is illustrated in Fig. 14 for the Z2 spin liquid phase of
the quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice [217] at the RK point [218], computed using exact diagonalization by

Furukawa and Misguich [159].

This subtraction trick has been used by several authors to measure the topological entanglement entropy [159,215,220–

222], but it turns out that it is easier and more accurate to work with a cylinder geometry, as done for instance in Refs.

[185,215,219,222–229].

vanishes, in perfect agreement with the predicted quantum dimension D = 2 from Eq. (2.19). Note the better accord for

the Kagomé model in Fig. 15 at larger Rényi parameters q, a consequence of the less good accuracy when computing lower

weight entanglement modes. Surprisingly this numerical limitation seems to be at variance with the results obtained in

Ref. [229].

4 Note that there are still some debates regarding the nature of the ground-state due to the existence of various competing low-energy states. Among the three candidates, the gapped Z2 spin liquid [230], the U(1) Dirac spin liquid [231], and the 36-site unit cell valence-bond solid [232], the most recent
d = 2 DMRG studies concluded for a Z2 spin liquid [219,233], with Z2 topological order. For recent discussions, see also Refs. [234,235].

Hall states at ν = 13/5 and ν = 12/5, apparently captured by the k = 3 parafermion Read–Rezayi state [240], have been

studied in Refs. [241,242]. The topological entanglement entropy of such a state γ

1.45 was successfully

captured using large scale DMRG simulations. Note also the non-abelian phases in the two-component ν = 2/3 fractional

quantum Hall states on a bilayer, with the emergence of Fibonacci anyons [243].

2.5.2.3. Other examples. We now give a very short (and clearly non-exhaustive) list of recently discussed topological ordered

phases characterized by their topological entropy. Using d = 2 DMRG for the s = 1/2 Kagomé antiferromagnet in an external

field, a magnetization plateau at filling 1/9 of saturation has been claimed to be a Z3 spin liquid state [244]. The existence
of this exotic plateau state had not been reported previously [245], but was diagnosed in a more recent study [246] to be

a valence bond crystal coexisting with spin order, a phase where topological order is absent. Still on the Kagomé lattice,

hard-core bosons at ν = 1/3 filling have revealed an interesting Z2 topological liquid state [247]. In Ref. [248] a frustrated

For extension to d > 2, we refer to the work of Grover et al. [251] (see also [252] for three-dimensional quantum spin

liquids in iridate materials and [253] for U(1) quantum spin liquids). Finally, for topological order and topological entropy

in classical systems, see e.g. Refs. [254–256].

3. Entanglement spectroscopy
Soon after the discovery of the DMRG algorithm for one dimensional quantum systems [257,258], some attempts have
been made to extend it to d = 2 [259–261]. However, it was then quickly realized that such an extension is a quite difficult
task, as observed through the study of the spectrum of the RDM, the entanglement spectrum (ES), for two dimensional non-interacting quantum systems [134]. Although such studies were first motivated by performance issues regarding the DMRG algorithm, some deeper investigations have later started to become a topic of increasing interest, in particular for quantum chains [262–266].
A breakthrough came in 2008 with the work of Li and Haldane [267] where they showed for ν = 5/2 fractional quantum
Hall states that the low lying part of the RDM spectrum contains universal features regarding topological properties. This has triggered a huge interest, in particular for topological order that we discuss below in Section 3.2. Roughly at the same time, Calabrese and Lefèvre [268] focused on the eigenvalues distribution of the RDM for critical spin chains described by a CFT, which also raised a large inquisitiveness, as we review in Section 3.1. Among numerous fascinating properties of entanglement spectroscopy, the notion of entanglement Hamiltonian has been also intensively debated, as we discuss in Section 3.3.

This critical regime is described by a CFT [270] with central charge c = 1, yielding the logarithmic growth [21] of the

Rény entanglement entropies Eq. (2.3). Making a real-space bipartition, which defines a subsystem A (depicted in the

inset of Fig. 17), its RDM ρA has eigenvalues λi which gives the ES ξi = − ln λi. The eigenvalues distribution was first studied by Calabrese and Lefèvre [268] using CFT and exact diagonalization of Eq. (3.1) at ∆ = 0. Exploiting the fact that

critical ferromagnetic regime −1 < ∆ < 0, Alba et al. [272] also observed a sizeable deviation form prediction Eq. (3.3).

Note that the theory of finite-entanglement scaling [273] precisely builds on such a universal distribution [274].

Using large scale DMRG we have explored [275] the distribution of λi for various anisotropy parameters ∆ along the critical regime of the XXZ model. Numerical results for n(λ) with very large systems, up to L = 2000 lattice sites and open

boundary conditions, are shown in Fig. 17. There, we see that the prediction Eq. (3.3) works remarkably well at the XX point

(free fermions), in agreement with Calabrese–Lefèvre, but with significant deviations appear for finite interaction ∆ ̸= 0.

Interestingly, attractive ∆ < 0 and repulsive ∆ > 0 interactions display opposite deviations, with a sign change at ∆ = 0.

A finite size analysis, shown in Fig. 17 (Bottom) for the isotropic point ∆ = 1, reveals that finite size effects are responsible

for the observed disagreement. Indeed, convergence to the asymptotic form Eq. (3.3) is slowed by logarithmic corrections
∼1/ ln L, with a prefactor which changes sign with the anisotropy ∆.5 So far there is no analytical understanding for such

finite size effects.

The CFT description is also encoded in the microscopic structure of the entanglement levels, as discussed in Refs.

[275,276]. Indeed, for critical XXZ [275,276], as well as for critical Bose–Hubbard chains [276,277], the low lying part of

the ES for subsystems of length ℓA corresponds to the energy spectrum of open chains of length ℓA with the same Luttinger parameter as the full system. This is shown in Fig. 18(b) for XXZ chains at ∆ = −0.5 where the low ‘‘energy’’ entanglement

levels are perfectly described by the CFT prediction [270] for the low-energy spectrum of a critical open chain of ℓA sites

5 These corrections exist on the entire critical regime and are not restricted to ∆ = 1 [275].

envelope Eq. (3.5), which is shown in Fig. 19(a) for Bose–Hubbard chains [276], and (b) for XXZ chains [275]. One should also mention some earlier results obtained by Peschel [278] on free electronic chains which suggest that the
effective Hamiltonian is an open free fermion chain, but with non-homogeneous hopping terms vanishing at the boundaries. Such microscopic details should not change the above picture for quantum critical chains. However, in the gapped Ising
regime of the XXZ chain (∆ ≫ 1), the boundary-local nature of the ES has been clearly identified [279]. Also one could
interpret the inhomogeneity in a local thermodynamic with a spatially varying local temperature [280,281] decaying away from the boundary.
In Refs. [282–285], the entanglement gap between the first two largest eigenvalues (the Schmidt gap) has been diagnosed as an order parameter to locate quantum phase transitions for quantum spin chain models, an idea further applied to quantum impurity problems [286]. One should however note that universal features captured by entanglement spectroscopy have been recently questioned when looking at momentum-space entanglement [287,288] where the closure of the Schmidt gap may not occur at the physical critical point. These second thoughts regarding universality are also supported by the recent discussion in Ref. [289].

3.1.1.2. Ladders. Ladder materials, originally introduced to study two-dimensional systems from a quasi-d = 1 perspec-
tive [290] are now well recognized to harbor many fascinating phenomena, and numerous experimental achievements [291–293]. A paradigmatic example is the two-leg ladder geometry (depicted in panel (c) of Fig. 20) for which the

antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model presents a singlet ground-state separated from the first excited triplet state by a finite energy gap. Nevertheless, as first shown by Poilblanc [294] by tracing out a single leg (subsystem A in panel (c) of Fig. 20), the ES reveals an unexpected gapless feature when studied against the momentum quantum number k of the chain.
Visible in Fig. 20(a), the eigenvalues λ of the RDM, plotted as ξ = − ln λ against the momentum k show a ‘‘low-energy’’
structure similar to the gapless des Cloizeaux–Pearson spectrum of a single Heisenberg chain [295]. It is quite remarkable that the ES appears to reflect the low-energy spectrum of each individual edge. This observation has then triggered further extensions and studies of quantum ladder systems [188,296–302]. In particular, the authors of Ref. [301] analyzed in detail, both analytically and numerically, the case of an interacting two-leg ladder of hard-core bosons with one gapless mode. The
√
resulting momentum-resolved ES, displayed in Fig. 20(b), features a k low-energy dispersion, in contrast with the gapped ladder case [294,296,299,300], thus reflecting the long-range nature of the boundary Hamiltonian (see also Section 3.3).
3.1.1.3. Quantum Monte Carlo approaches for entanglement spectroscopy. While exact diagonalization, DMRG, and tensor network approaches have been the most useful numerical techniques able to access ES of strongly correlated quantum systems, very recent developments have been made using QMC methods [75,113,116,188]. For fermionic systems, Assaad and co-workers proposed a method based on the computation of spectral functions along the imaginary time [113,116]. Another route was suggested for bosonic and quantum spin models [75,188], using the fact that one can reconstruct the ES from higher-order Rényi entropies. This method, introduced in Ref. [95], and implemented in a QMC framework for Bose–Hubbard chains [75] and quantum spin ladders [188], relies on the Newton–Girard identities, which links the coefficients of a polynomial to the power sums of its roots.
However, in any practical QMC simulation, the knowledge of Rényi entanglement entropies is limited to some finite
precision, and to not too large value of the Rényi parameter q ≤ qmax. For the extended Bose–Hubbard chain at unit filling, Chung et al. [75] have been able reconstruct the low lying levels of the ES using qmax = 4, as plotted in Fig. 21(b). In Ref. [188] we have studied the isotropic s = 1/2 Heisenberg ladder with Jleg = Jrung up to qmax = 9. QMC results are shown in Fig. 21(a) for a 2 × 10 system (with the same bipartition as discussed previously in Fig. 20), and compared to exact DMRG results, as
well as to the same reconstruction trick using DMRG data for Sq≤10. The convergence of the lowest entanglement level (in the
Sz = 0 sector) is very good, thus providing an efficient estimate of the single copy entanglement S∞ = − ln λmax [303,304]
for which no direct QMC estimate is available, as it would rely on a Monte Carlo sampling of an infinite number of replicas. Nevertheless, despite the numerical gain using the spin-resolved structure of the RDM, we clearly see the limitations of this technique to access higher entanglement levels, even for exact DMRG data, while the reconstructed QMC spectrum carries additional errors due to the statistical uncertainty of the Rényi entanglement entropies.
Before switching to d = 2, one should mention an alternative spectroscopic tool relying on the participation
spectrum [194,195], which can be computed very efficiently within a QMC framework. This will be discussed below, when addressing the issue of entanglement Hamiltonian in Section 3.3.

3.1.2. Conventional ordered and gapped states in d > 1
3.1.2.1. Gapped phases. Accessing the ES of quantum interacting systems beyond d = 1 is a challenging task. While
entanglement spectroscopy was popularized after the work of Li and Haldane [267] as a smoking gun of topological order for
d = 2 non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states (see below in Section 3.2), somehow surprisingly, less is known regarding traditional d = 2 phases of matter, e.g. symmetry breaking states or conventional quantum critical points. Indeed, only a
few analytical works are available, exploring for example ES for broken continuous symmetry states [147], complex paired superfluids [305], valence-bond solid states [306], or the quantum Ising model [289]. On the numerical side, most of the simulation results have been obtained using diagonalization techniques [307], tensor network approaches [296,308], or
d = 2 DMRG [74,186,309] (see Fig. 22).
For gapped phases, the structure of the ES reflects the physics at the boundary, similarly to the Heisenberg ladder case [294] discussed above, with a short-range entanglement Hamiltonian following a correspondence between the ES and the edge physics [296,306]. This is illustrated in Fig. 22 from Ref. [296] where one sees that the AKLT state [310] features the
same ES in d = 2 and on a 2-leg ladder. For the d = 2 Bose–Hubbard model studied by Alba et al. [74], in the gapped Mott insulating phase at large on-site
repulsion, the ES acquires the boundary structure of a simple tight-biding chain with short-range hopping of the excess particles on top of the insulating state, (see Fig. 23).

3.1.2.2. Long-range order. The case of long-range ordered states where a continuous symmetry is broken, such as the U(1) for a superfluid [74] or SU(2) for Néel ordered antiferromagnets [186] is more subtle. Indeed, the ES has to reflect the broken symmetry and therefore cannot be a simple edge spectrum of an effective model with short-range interactions like in the gapped case discussed previously. As suggested by the field theory approach of Metlitski and Grover [147], and observed numerically using DMRG for the superfluid regime of the Bose–Hubbard on the square lattice [74] and the Néel phase of the Heisenberg model on various lattices [186], the ES has to contain both Anderson TOS [174] and oscillators (SW) structures. This is indeed what we can see for the U(1) broken superfluid in Fig. 23 where the TOS yields a quadratic envelope in
terms of the particle number ∼ δ × (δNA)2, with a ‘‘TOS gap’’ δ vanishing with the linear size W of the subsystem as 1/W (with possible logarithmic corrections [147]). The SW part has a finite gap ∆ (or possibly slowly vanishing ∼1/ ln W [147])
in the ordered regime. As we discuss more below in Section 3.3, when comparing ES to the physical spectrum of a given ‘‘entanglement Hamiltonian’’, one should be careful about the entanglement temperature which renormalizes the ES, here
with a factor Teff ∼ 1/W .

3.2. Entanglement spectroscopy of topological order

Quantum states of matter which exhibit topological properties, e.g. fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) [311], topological insulators [312], chiral or Z2 spin liquids [313], AKLT states [310], etc. have been conjectured by Li and Haldane [267] to display edge excitations in their ground-state ES. This idea has then been extensively pursued for FQHE [241,314–331], topological insulators [332–340], quantum spin liquids [228,341–344], valence bond spin states [306,307,345–349], or the toric code [296,350]. While this field is still relatively young, there has been an impressive number of works since Li and Haldane proposal. Therefore, providing an exhaustive review of such recent developments is clearly out of the scope of the present paper. Below we try to give a short overview, focusing on a few aspects such as the identification of topological order through the ES, the edge-ES correspondence, and the recent advances in topological properties of quantum spin liquids.

3.2.1. Identify topological order with entanglement spectra Before discussing FQHE, one can first illustrate the power of entanglement spectroscopy for characterizing non-trivial
states, such as the Haldane phase of open spin s = 1 Heisenberg chains, governed by

that such VBS phase was previously addressed from an entanglement point of view using the concept of localizable entanglement [353–355].
Despite the lack of local order parameter, and the fragility regarding small perturbations of the string (non-local) order and of the edge states, Pollmann and co-workers have shown [345] that provided an appropriate set of symmetries remains preserved, the Haldane phase is stable. The signature of this topological state has to be read in the lower part of the ES, as visible in Fig. 24 where one sees 2 degenerate non-zero eigenvalues, mimicking the edge spectrum of a system with a true physical boundary. Such a stability can be used as an operational definition of the topologically protected Haldane phase [356]. Note this was previously discussed by Ryu and Hatsugai [332] for a Chern insulator.
For the FQHE Li and Haldane, building on Ref. [237], suggested [267] an orbital bipartition which, while not equivalent, may imitate a real space cut. They conjectured that such an orbital ES should reflect the edge mode. This has effectively
been observed in several cases, either for Laughlin wave-functions describing ν = 1/m states, the Moore–Read state at ν = 5/2, and also beyond model wave-functions through more realistic Hamiltonians including Coulomb interaction. In
Fig. 25 we illustrate this with the result obtained by Regnault [357] for the Laughlin model wave-function and the Coulomb
case for ν = 1/3 which both display the correct U(1) edge mode counting. For the more realistic spectrum obtained with
Coulomb interactions (panel (b) of Fig. 25), the universal structure, similar to the Laughlin model state, is protected from the non-universal high-energy part by a finite entanglement gap ∆ξ . The universal part is described by CFT [267]. When approaching quantum Hall phase transitions, this entanglement gap has been found to vanish [315,317,358].

3.2.2. Correspondence between edge and entanglement spectra A natural question which immediately arises concerns the universal character of the correspondence between the low
lying part of the ES and the edge states, as posed by Chandran and co-workers [320] for several FQH states. They found a

Fig. 26. Cut and glue approach [321] applied to a quantum Hall state on a cylinder. The system is cut into A and B, obtaining gapless modes described by
chiral Luttinger liquids, Hr and Hl living on the new edges. We then glue them along the edges by switching on an interaction λHlr that couples A and
B. The entanglement problem of the quantum Hall state can then be reduced to the problem of entanglement between the two coupled chiral Luttinger liquids [301]. Source: Inspired from Ref. [321].
direct correspondence between mode countings of particle ES, the orbital ES studied by Li and Haldane [267], and bulk quasiholes using CFT. The latter being equal to the counting of edge modes at physical hard-cut on the sample, they interpret their results as a bulk-edge correspondence [359] for the ES.
Using CFT, a general proof for this correspondence has been proposed by Qi, Katsura and Ludwig [321] for d = 2 + 1 topological states with d = 1 + 1 chiral edges using the cut and glue approach, as illustrated in Fig. 26. Starting by cutting
a cylinder in two subsystems A and B which both support gapless chiral edge states, they are then glued together along the edges by switching an interaction between A and B. The cut being considered as a sudden quantum quench, it was proved using boundary CFT that both chiral edge and entanglement Hamiltonians are equivalent. Let us also mention other proofs that have been proposed, also based on CFT [326,360].
From a numerical point of view, the tensor networks PEPS formalism [361] gives new insights on this question by directly constructing a ‘‘holographic’’ [362] correspondence between the ES and a boundary Hamiltonian, as initiated by Cirac and co-workers [296,363] where it was found that for a gapped bulk the ES corresponds to a short-range gapless Hamiltonian [306,307]. In the case of non-chiral topological phases where there are no protected gapless edge modes, such as the Kitaev toric code model which has Z2 topological order, it has been shown [364] that there is no such a correspondence between the ES and edge physics.

3.2.3. Chiral spin liquid state
Spin liquids [313] are very good candidates for testing the correspondence between edge modes appearing along a physical cut and the entanglement modes along the virtual edge after bipartition. Quantum spin liquid states have been intensively studied using entanglement spectroscopy [226,228,341–344].
Quite recently, the Kagomé lattice has again revealed a very rich physics exhibiting chiral phases [341–344,344,365– 370]. Indeed, two types of Heisenberg models have been found to realize the so-called chiral spin liquid state [211,212], expected to have time-reversal and parity symmetries (spontaneously or explicitly) broken, with a non-zero chiral order.

3.3. Entanglement Hamiltonian

The notion of entanglement Hamiltonian HE , simply defined by

ρA = exp(−HE ),

(3.9)

has been first discussed in the context of non-interacting systems [181], for which Peschel and Chung [134,263,371] have shown that HE has the same free-particle form as the original Hamiltonian. After Li and Haldane work [267] for fractional quantum Hall states, the idea that HE contains some universal properties of the virtual edge induced by the bipartition was vastly popularized for various condensed matter systems [74,186,195,294,296,297,299–302,307,340,372–374]. Below
we discuss a few representative examples of gapped states, such as spin ladders or d = 2 coupled dimers for which the
entanglement Hamiltonian has a short-range nature. We also investigate gapless states where the situation is more involved when correlations get long ranged.

3.3.1. Boundary theories for gapped phases

3.3.1.1. Perturbative approach for spin ladders. After the observation [294,296] of the correspondence for (gapped) 2-leg spin ladders between the ES and the energy spectrum of a single (gapless) Heisenberg chain (see also Fig. 20), an analytical perturbative approach was proposed [297,299,302] for a real space cut along the rungs (as depicted in the panel (c) of Fig. 20).

in good agreement with the fact that pair-wise effective interactions at distance r are generated at rth-order perturbation
with amplitude ∼ (J1/J2)r [299]. Interestingly this entanglement length ξE is qualitatively different from the true correlation length of the spin ladder ξcorr ∼ J1/J2 [375]. While multi-spin (beyond pair-wise) interactions may also play a role [296], the
above bilinear Heisenberg chain model Eq. (3.12) is already a very good approximation for the entanglement Hamiltonian
in the rung singlet phase of the Heisenberg ladder, as we demonstrate below using QMC.

6 Only pair-wise interactions are considered here, while small multiple 2p-spin interactions are generated at pth-order perturbation [296,299]. For larger

spins s ≥ 1, the entanglement Hamiltonian is still well described by a spin-s chain with a nearest-neighbor coupling independent of s, whereas longer

range couplings do depend on s [300]. For XXZ chains, the HE

has a renormalized Ising anisotropy [299,300], for instance for s

3.3.1.2. Quantum-thermal mapping. T = 0 Rényi entanglement entropies can be exactly identified with thermal entropies

(see for instance Ref. [376] for an holographic approach) at temperature β = 1 for the effective model HE defined by Eq. (3.9). One can also interpret the RDM as a thermal density matrix at inverse temperature βeff of an effective model

whose energy scale is set to J1 (the energy scale of the underlying Hamiltonian), as in Eq. (3.12). For a short-range interacting

s = 1/2 Heisenberg chain of ℓ sites, CFT predicts [377] for the low temperature regime 1 ≫ T /J1 ≫ 1/ℓ a thermal entropy

Eq. (2.3).

For gapped spin ladders the effective temperature is of O(1), a regime where there is no analytical expression for

Sqth. We have therefore performed numerical simulations [188] to compute Sqth(T ) of a s = 1/2 Heisenberg chain (with nearest-neighbor only) at high temperature using exact diagonalization for ℓ = 20 sites, which was then compared to

the Rényi-entanglement entropy for 2 × 20 Heisenberg ladders at various Rényi indices and rung couplings J2, computed

using the improved QMC estimate developed in Ref. [188]. These results are displayed in Fig. 28 for varying rung couplings

J2/J1 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, where comparing with the simplest nearest-neighbor entanglement Hamiltonian HE (ξE = 0), we

extract the effective inverse temperature for which the two quantities match. If the entanglement Hamiltonian is correct,

the effective inverse temperature has to be independent of q. This is clearly the case if J2/J1 becomes large, as visible in the

main panel and inset of Fig. 28, where the deviation from Eq. (3.13) is getting smaller and flatter (as a function of q) when

J2/J1 increases.

3.3.2. Participation spectroscopy A very powerful tool to further investigate this quantum—thermal mapping is the participation spectroscopy, introduced
in [195]. The participation spectrum is defined in a given computational basis {|i⟩} by the diagonal of the RDM

 ζiA = − ln ⟨i|ρA|i⟩ ,

(3.15)

with i = 1, . . . , 2N for a subsystem A of N spin 1/2 for example. Using the entanglement Hamiltonian in Eq. (3.12), the
effective participation spectrum





ζiE = ln Z − ln ⟨i| exp(−βeffHE )|i⟩ ,

(3.16)

must fulfill, for all levels i, ζiE = ζiA, provided HE is the correct entanglement Hamiltonian and βeff the effective inverse temperature.7 Interestingly, participation levels {ζi} are easily measurable with QMC, contrary to the ES, except for the very
low lying part which might be accessible8 in some cases [75,113,188].
A quantitative way to compare two spectra relies on the so-called Kullback–Leibler divergence KL [378] which measures the difference between the two probability distributions e−ζ A and e−ζ E . When normalized by the Shannon entropy Eq. (2.16)

7 This condition is necessary but not sufficient. 8 Note however that the low ‘‘energy’’ part of the ES may not capture universal properties since we are not interested in ground-state but finite
temperature properties of the entanglement Hamiltonian.

In Fig. 29 we show a color map of such a KL divergence Eq. (3.17) comparing the participation spectra of half ladders for
various rung couplings J2/J1 against the effective short-range Heisenberg chain model Eq. (3.12) in the parameter space spanned by the effective inverse temperature βeff and the entanglement length ξE . We clearly see a minimum of the KL divergence with a very small magnitude < 10−4, in good agreement with the perturbative result Eqs. (3.13) and (3.14). The
KL divergence provides a very precise qualitative tool to test the validity of a given entanglement Hamiltonian.
This approach has also been used for a d = 2 quantum spin model [195], defined by coupled s = 1/2 dimers (Fig. 30)

with J1, J2 ≥ 0. Considering only g = J2/J1 ≤ 1 (g = 1 being the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet), this model, intensively studied at zero temperature [380–385], exhibits at gc = 0.52370(1) [385] a 2 + 1 O(3) quantum critical point separating a disordered gapped regime for g < gc from an antiferromagnetic Néel ordered phase at g > gc , with
a spontaneous breaking of the SU(2) symmetry. The participation spectrum of a one-dimensional subsystem (see Fig. 30)
in the gapped regime is plotted in Fig. 31 and compared with the one-dimensional effective Hamiltonian equation (3.12).
Deep in the gapped regime, the results are very similar to the 2-leg ladder case, with a well-defined minimum in the KL
divergences.

3.3.3. Gapless states
3.3.3.1. Quantum critical point. When the O(3) quantum critical point is approached, the entanglement length increases,
while the effective temperature slightly decreases but remains of order one. As discussed by Cirac et al. [296], the short-range nature of the entanglement Hamiltonian qualitatively changes when approaching criticality. Based on the participation spectroscopy analysis [195], the best effective model which captures criticality for the line subsystem is no longer the short-range Hamiltonian equation (3.12) (which cannot display algebraic correlations at finite temperature), but the

In Fig. 32 we provide a direct comparison between the short-range model Eq. (3.12) and the one with power-law

3.3.3.2. Néel ordered regime. Keeping the same one-dimensional setup for subsystem A, one can cross the critical point and
explore the Néel ordered side for g > gc , as done in Refs. [194,195]. In this regime, while the power-law model Eq. (3.19) gives reasonable KL (Fig. 33 top) for parameters (α − βeff) where finite temperature order is expected, a better agreement
between participation spectra is found for the model

as shown in Fig. 33 for three values of J2 in the Néel regime. Following Refs. [74,147,186,389], we expect the entanglement Hamiltonian to have both TOS and SW structures, as
already discussed above for the superfluid regime of the d = 2 Bose–Hubbard model, see Section 3.1.2.2. In Eq. (3.20), the Λ term (constant at all distances, with a 1/L normalization to ensure extensivity) has the Lieb–Mattis [390] form which has TOS but does not sustain relativistic SW excitations, whereas the power-law component ∼1/r3 is expected to bring Ωsw ∼ k excitations and 1/r decaying spin correlation functions [387].
Entanglement spectroscopy for the Néel state has also been studied using PEPS calculations [373] where it was
interpreted using a mapping onto a bosonic t–J chain with long distance hopping terms.

4. Impurity and disorder effects
Disorder and quantum fluctuations have the common tendency to destabilize classical order. Whether intrinsically present in materials, chemically controlled via doping, or explicitly introduced via a random potential (as in ultra-cold atomic systems) or by varying the thickness in superconducting films, randomness can lead to dramatic changes in physical properties of condensed matter systems, as experienced for instance with the Anderson localization [199,391], the Kondo effect [392,393], glassy physics [394], etc.
In such a context, entanglement witnesses have provided new tools to investigate various disordered systems as we review below, focusing on three representative examples. In Section 4.1, we discuss disordered quantum spin systems which despite some similarities with their clean counterparts, display major differences. Another paradigmatic example of impurity physics is the Kondo effect for which the putative ‘‘Kondo screening cloud’’ can be probed using the concept of impurity entanglement entropy, as we present in Section 4.2. Finally, in Section 4.3 we discuss recent advances in the context on Anderson localization in the presence of interactions, the so-called ‘‘many-body localization’’ from entanglement perspectives, either at and out of equilibrium.

4.1. Disordered quantum spin systems
Impurity and disorder in quantum spin systems have been intensively investigated for several decades, in particular in the context of spin-glass physics [394–396]. For random field and random exchange quantum magnets, the strong disorder decimation method in real space [397–399] has been used quite intensively, with the celebrated example of the infinite randomness fixed point (IRFP) analytically described by Fisher in a series of seminal papers for random spin chains
[398,400]. Later these ideas have been extended to d > 1 where a numerical approach is inevitable [401–403].

4.1.1. Entanglement in random spin chains

4.1.1.1. Random singlet state for random bonds spin s = 1/2 chains. Building on the decimation solution of the s = 1/2

random exchange XXZ chain [400] and of the random transverse field Ising chain [398], Refael and Moore [404] have shown

that at such an IRFP, the disorder-average von Neumann entropy follows a similar logarithmic growth with sub-system

size x as in the clean case Eq. (2.3), but with a smaller prefactor c ln 2, where c is the central charge of the critical clean

system (c = 1/2 for Ising and c = 1 for XXZ). This result can be simply understood as a direct consequence of the

perturbative structure of the ground-state of the XXZ chain in the limit of strong disorder, the so-called random-singlet
state [400] (depicted in Fig. 34) where the probability of finding a singlet of length x is ≃1/(3x2) [405]. The quantum Ising

case follows immediately using a direct relationship with the XX chain [406] which can be seen as two decoupled quantum

Ising chains [407].

This surprising analytical prediction was rapidly confirmed numerically [408] using exact diagonalization at the XX

point where free-fermion techniques [278] allow to reach quite large chains. These results are shown in Fig. 34 (left panel)

groups [405,409–411]. The random singlet structure also led to the notion of valence bond entanglement entropy [412–416]

which is asymptotically equivalent to the usual entanglement entropy at the IRFP [412,416].

For higher order Rényi indices, Fagotti and co-workers [410] have shown that the situation is more subtle. Indeed,

depending how the disorder averaging ⟨. . .⟩ is performed, they found a different prefactor for the logarithmic scaling:

in Ref. [398] where typical and average have qualitatively different scalings.

The distribution of Tr ρA2, shown in the main panel of Fig. 35 for the random singlet state of random XX chains (exact diagonalization results) for increasing system lengths L = 16, . . . , 512, displays broadening at small values with increasing size, suggesting non-self-averaging entanglement.10 In the inset of Fig. 35, the log scalings are plotted for q = 1, 2, showing

a very good agreement with the analytical prediction Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2).

Non-abelian random-singlet states are also expected for disordered chains of Majorana or Fibonacci anyons [422–424], with

a logarithmic von Neumann entropy whose ‘‘effective central charge’’ pre-factor is given by ln d, where d is the quantum

√

dimension, e.g. d = 2 for a Majorana chain, and d = (1 + 5)/2 for Fibonacci.

4.1.2. Entanglement, disorder, and RG flows
4.1.2.1. Absence of c-theorem. Following Zamolodchikov c-theorem [425] which yields for clean (disorder-free) fixed points a decreasing of entanglement entropy along RG flows, the question whether this also holds in the presence of disorder was addressed after the discovery of decreasing entropies along infinite randomness flows [404,408,421]. Two counter examples have shown that this cannot be true for disordered fixed points, as first discussed by Santachiara [426] for generalized quantum Ising chains including the N-states random Potts chain, and later by Fidkowski and co-workers [423] for disordered chains of Fibonacci anyons. The phase diagram of this disordered golden chain model is sketched in Fig. 36, as also discussed by Refael and Moore in Ref. [427].

10 One may also try to interpret Tr ρA2 as the inverse participation ratio in the Schmidt basis. Using this analogy, ⟨ Sq⟩ would correspond to the average while ⟨Sq⟩ would be the typical value.

4.1.2.2. Engineered disorder. Interestingly, a volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy can be achieved for the ground-state of a class of random spin chains where disorder is not random, but engineered, building on the decimation rules such that the probability of finding a singlet at any distance x is uniform. Designed with very fast decaying couplings, the so-called concentric singlet phase can be constructed [428–430], with a very strong entanglement entropy proportional to the number of sites inside the subsystem.11
Another model where disorder is partly controlled was proposed by Binosi and co-workers [433], through the following disordered quantum Ising chain model

H = −  Ji Siz Siz+1 + Six ,
i

(4.4)

where one sees that the independent random couplings Ji act on both a site and its adjacent link, such that a perfect (but purely local) correlation is achieved. Using field theory, strong disorder RG, and large scale numerical diagonalization techniques, we have investigated this interesting model in Ref. [434]. For perfect correlation weak disorder is irrelevant, whereas any small breaking of the perfect correlation between field and coupling in Eq. (4.4) brings the system back to infinite-randomness physics. For larger disorder (and perfect local correlation), there is a line of critical points with unusual properties such as an increase of the entanglement entropy with the disorder strength, as shown in Fig. 37.
This model brings an interesting example where by construction the disordered system is always strictly critical at the local level. This apparent suppression of local randomness protects the clean physics against small disorder, but at strong enough disorder a new physics appears where entanglement increases with the strength of disorder. The XXZ extension of this model was recently studied in Ref. [435], reaching similar conclusions as compared to free fermions.

Finally, let us note the interesting case of aperiodic quantum spin chains [436–438] where the entanglement entropy was studied using strong disorder RG [439,440]. A logarithmic growth with subsystem size was found, with a non-universal prefactor depending on the aperiodic sequence, and possibly larger than the corresponding clean case.

4.1.3. d > 1 infinite randomness

Infinite randomness physics is not specific to one dimension, as shown for the d ≥ 2 disordered quantum Ising
model [401,403,441,442], disordered contact process [443], or dissipative systems [444]. However, note that random singlet
physics does not describe d > 1 random exchange antiferromagnets [402,445], where long-range order is surprisingly
robust to disorder [445].
Entanglement entropy at the IRFP of the d = 2 random transverse field Ising model on the square lattice has been first studied numerically in [447] where a surprising double logarithmic enhancement of the area law was found S ∼ L ln(ln L),
based on strong disorder RG arguments.12 Later, using larger systems, Yu and co-workers [449] concluded for a pure area
law with additive (negative) logarithmic corrections.
Using a greatly improved strong disorder RG algorithm where the O(N3) running time of the naïve algorithm was brought down to O(N ln N) for arbitrary dimension, Kovács and Iglói [403,441] have studied entanglement of d = 2, 3, 4 disordered quantum Ising models up to N ∼ 106 spins [450]. This allowed to get a very good control of finite size scaling, as shown
in Fig. 38 where the square lattice entropy, plotted as a function of the subsystem size, clearly displays a pure area law as
a leading term. Interestingly, corrections to this area law scaling can be precisely computed: in two dimensions, for square
(or slab in higher dimension) subsystems, additive logarithmic corrections are found [450], coming from the 4 corners of a
square subsystem, such that

SvN = aL + 4l1(π /2) ln L + constant

(4.5)

with l1(π /2) = −0.029(1) obtained for very large clusters, up to 2048×2048 (to be compared with −0.019(5) obtained for smaller systems 160×160 by Yu et al. [449]). This log correction, arising from π /2 corners at a strong disorder fixed point, can
be compared to clean critical points contributions studied in Section 2.3.2, and reported in Table 2. More generally, Kovács
and Iglói found that additive logarithmic contributions induced by the sharp subsystems boundaries only occur at criticality,
as shown in the bottom part of Fig. 39 where the corner part appears to be a universal singular function, describing the log
divergence at the critical point with a prefactor whose magnitude and sign depend on the dimension: l1(3d) = 0.012(2), and l1(4d) = −0.006(2).
Such universal features of the additive logarithmic corrections to the area law appear to be a promising way to further
characterize quantum criticality [162,164,165].

4.2. Entanglement and Kondo physics

4.2.1. Generalities The resistivity minimum observed in dilute magnetic alloys received a beautiful theoretical explanation by Jun
Kondo [392] based on a perturbative calculation which breaks down at low-energy. This is a remarkable condensed

12 Nevertheless, another type of IRFP in higher dimensions occurs in the bond-diluted quantum Ising ferromagnet [448] for which the same authors [447] found (using much larger system sizes) a pure area law contribution at the percolation threshold.

matter example of asymptotic freedom [451], with the effective interaction between magnetic impurities and conduction electrons growing when the temperature decreases. Non-perturbative calculations, based on a scaling approach [452], the renormalization group (RG) [453], Fermi liquid theory [454], Bethe Ansatz [455,456] provide a very powerful framework to study this non-trivial many-body problem (for a thorough review, see [393]). In particular, the anomalous scattering from magnetic impurities leads to an enhancement of both specific heat and magnetic susceptibility at low temperature,
below the Kondo temperature TK . The thermal entropy STh(T ) is a non-trivial function of T , reflecting the RG fixed points of the Kondo problem. In the limit of a weak bare Kondo coupling, the impurity contribution SiTmhp(T ) ≈ ln 2 at T ≫ TK and SiTmhp(T ) → 0 at T ≪ TK . This reflects the fact that the bare coupling of the magnetic impurity to the conduction electrons is very weak so that we obtain essentially the full entropy of a free spin-1/2, ln 2 at T ≫ TK . However, as the
temperature is lowered the spin becomes ‘‘screened’’ i.e. it goes into a singlet state and the impurity entropy is accordingly

lost. The asymptotic values of SiTmhp(T ) at high and low temperatures are characteristic of the RG fixed points of the Kondo
Hamiltonian. However much less is known about real space spatial properties of the Kondo effect, in particular the so-called Kondo
screening length ξK ∼ vF /TK (where vF is the Fermi velocity) which is expected to govern spatial correlations at T ≪
TK [457]. Such a Kondo screening cloud,13 which can be seen as the region over which a magnetic impurity forms a singlet with a conduction electron, is very hard to experimentally observe in realistic systems because it occurs over quite large
distances ∼µm, and decays as 1/rd [457], thus making reduced dimensionality better candidates to observe it [459–461].

4.2.2. Impurity entanglement in the one-channel Kondo problem
Recently, several developments have been made to study how the Kondo length ξK emerges in the entanglement
properties of quantum impurity problems [462–473]. Assuming a direct analogy with the thermal impurity entropy which
is a scaling function f (T /TK ), one might expect the zero temperature impurity entanglement entropy to be also a scaling function g(r/ξK ), where r is the spatial extension of the subsystem over which entanglement is computed.
The usual Kondo Hamiltonian [474] contains a Heisenberg interaction between a simp = 1/2 impurity spin and otherwise
non-interacting electrons:

 H = d3r ψ Ď(−∇2/2m)ψ + JK δ3(⃗r)ψ Ď(σ⃗ /2)ψ · ⃗simp .

(4.6)

At zero temperature, the impurity spin is screened by the conduction electrons through the formation of a Kondo singlet, expected to take place over a length scale:

ξK = vF /TK ∝ e1/(νJK ),

(4.7)

where ν is the density of states per spin band, TK is the Kondo temperature and vF the velocity of the fermions. Due to the δ-function form of the interaction Eq. (4.6) can be reduced to a one-dimensional model on a semi-infinite line with the

impurity spin at the origin [463]. A further simplification is possible using the spin chain Kondo model [475,476], depicted

Numerical simulations on this simplified Kondo model Eq. (4.8) have been carried out [49,462,463,465], showing that
(i) open boundary conditions lead to oscillations of the entanglement entropy, slowly decaying away from the boundaries
with an exponent governed by the Luttinger parameter [49]; and (ii) the impurity contribution to the entanglement entropy
appears to be a universal scaling function SiEmp(R, r, JK′ ) = g(r/ξK , R/ξK ), where r (R) is the subsystem (full system) size, see Fig. 40, and ξK (JK′ ) is the Kondo length.

(4.8) was shown to be integrable with Bethe Ansatz by Frahm and Zvyagin [478], with also a strong analogy with the Kondo problem but with a modified Kondo temperature TK ∼ exp(−b/JK′ ). For J2 > J2c , the spin chain enters a dimerized phase [479] with a gap and the relation between
Eq. (4.8) and Kondo physics no longer holds.

The simplest quantity to study is the single site impurity entanglement entropy (defined for r = 1) which is directly proportional to the impurity magnetization ⟨szimp⟩. This local observable, studied for the spin-boson model [480–482] and
for the usual Kondo problem [483,484] was shown to violate scaling in Ref. [463]. Indeed, the Kondo screening mechanism
being a non-local many-body quantum effect, scaling properties are expected to occur for many-body correlators, as for
instance in the entanglement of a finite size r > 1 region. The impurity contribution to the entanglement entropy was
therefore studied [462,463] in the limit 1 ≪ r ≪ R, defined by

Simp(R, r, JK′ ) = Su(R, r, JK′ ) − Su(R − 1, r − 1, 1),

(4.9)

where Su(R, r, JK′ ) is the uniform part of the entropy for a total system of length R, a subsystem of length r and a boundary coupling JK′ . DMRG simulation results are displayed in Fig. 41 for R even and odd. In the strong coupling regime r/ξK ≫ 1, the local Fermi liquid theory of Nozières [454] predicts Simp = π ξK /(12r), perfectly captured by the numerical results in Fig. 41. In the opposite limit, when the Kondo cloud is much larger than the subsystem r/ξK ≪ 1, DMRG data from Fig. 41 suggest limr/ξK →0 limr/R→0 Simp(r/ξK , r/R) = ln 2, for either parity of R.
A heuristic picture giving the general features of Simp(r/ξK , r/R), for both even and odd R, sketched in Ref. [462,463], can
be derived from a resonating valence bond view of the ground state, as depicted if Fig. 40(b, c). We loosely identify Simp with
ln 2× the probability of an ‘‘impurity valence bond’’ (IVB) stretching from the impurity site into the region > r (Fig. 40). The typical length of the IVB is expected to be ∼ξK (for ξK < R), leading to the monotonic decrease of Simp with increasing r/ξK , for R even, and its vanishing as r/ξK → ∞. For R odd, the ground state contains one unpaired spin. When ξK → ∞ this unpaired spin is the impurity itself, implying no IVB and hence Simp = 0. As ξK decreases the probability of having an
IVB increases, since the unpaired spin becomes more likely to be at another site, due to Kondo screening, but the average
length of the IVB, when it is present, decreases. These two effects trade off to give Simp a maximum when ξK ∝ R, in good agreement with the inset of Fig. 41, at which point the probability of having an IVB becomes O(1) but the decreasing average size of the IVB starts to significantly reduce the probability of it stretching into the region > r.

4.2.3. Boundary effects
Conformally invariant boundary fixed points are expected to present a term in the entanglement entropy which corresponds to the zero temperature Affleck–Ludwig impurity entropy ln g [485], as pointed out in Ref. [21]. Therefore, in a semi-infinite chain with the subsystem starting at the boundary, Eq. (2.3) becomes

SqOBC(r )

(4.10)

For the single channel Kondo model ln g = ln 2 at the weak coupling fixed point where the impurity is unscreened,
and ln g = 0 at the strong coupling fixed point where it is screened. The thermodynamic impurity entropy decreases monotonically from ln 2 to 0 with decreasing T /TK , in the same way as the impurity entanglement entropy with increasing r/ξK .
The validity of Eq. (4.10) has been checked numerically for various examples of conformally invariant boundary
conditions, for quantum Ising chains [463,486–488], a case where there is no boundary induced oscillations, as well as
for the two-channel Kondo problem [79]. Conversely, for critical open chain models having a continuous symmetry, slowly
decaying oscillations have been reported [49,489–492] and interpreted as 2kF -Friedel oscillations [493], whose decay is governed by the Luttinger parameter [49,50]. An exact computation for the XX (free-fermions) case was done by Fagotti and

Calabrese [50] who derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior for large block sizes on the basis of a recent mathematical

theorem for the determinant of Toeplitz plus Hankel matrices. Interestingly, unusual oscillating corrections have been

reported for higher Rényi indices q > 1 for open systems, and also for periodic chains, i.e. in the absence of boundary [44–46].

Despite the good analytical description for free fermions [50], boundary induced oscillations in the von Neumann entropy

still lack a complete analytical understanding for interacting critical systems. A phenomenological grasp was conjectured,

based on DMRG data analysis and a valence bond picture in Ref. [49] where the alternating part in the entropy for critical

XXZ chains was found to be directly proportional to the alternating term in the energy density. Indeed, open end breaks

translational invariance and a slowly decaying alternating term (at 2kF = π in the absence of external magnetic field)

or ‘‘dimerization’’ in the energy density Eu(r, R) + (−1)r Estag(r, R) appears at distance r for chains of length R, where for

where v is the velocity of excitations, and a the lattice spacing, introduced to respect the dimensionless character of the
entanglement entropy. Fig. 42 summarizes these results, obtained in Refs. [49,464]. It is important to note that boundary induced oscillations are relevant for the DMRG technique which performs better
with OBC, and also in the experimental context of cold atoms where such oscillations have been predicted for trapped
bosons [494]. Likewise, open ends lead to oscillations in gapped models, such as the s = 1 Heisenberg chain [495], but
with an alternating part which decays exponentially fast with the distance from the boundary, confirming the fact that this alternating component is controlled by the spin–spin correlations. Let us finally notice that boundary critical phenomena have also been studied using entanglement renormalization schemes [496,497].

4.2.4. Other examples of quantum impurity problems probed by entanglement
The two-impurity Kondo problem was investigated using two-site entanglement witnesses in Ref. [498], or the more complex many-body Schmidt gap, expected to play the role of an order parameter close to quantum criticality [286], likewise observed for the two-channel Kondo problem [79]. Another example of quantum criticality was studied for the spin-boson model [480] where quantum entanglement of the impurity was studied in great detail [481,482,499,500]. Entanglement entropy was also studied near Kondo-destruction quantum critical points [472].
Local defects in quantum wires, reminiscent of the so-called Kane–Fisher problem [475,501], have been studied quite intensively using entanglement estimates [103,470,502–507]. Dynamical properties have also been investigated for quantum impurity problems. For instance in quantum Ising chains with local or extended defects, the time evolution of the entanglement entropy, studied by Iglói and co-workers [508], displays a logarithmic growth with a non-universal prefactor which depends on the details of the defects.
The Kondo cloud dynamics has been probed after a quantum quench in the resonant level model. At long enough time inside the light cone, the Kondo screening cloud relaxes exponentially to the final equilibrium structure, with a relaxation rate given by the emergent energy scale of impurity screening [509]. Finally, universal oscillations in the entanglement levels have also been reported by Bayat and co-workers [510] for the two-impurity Kondo spin chain model after a local quench of the RKKY interaction from RKKY to Kondo regime.

4.3. Many-body localization

4.3.1. General properties
The so-called many-body localization phenomenon has attracted a huge interest in recent years, following precursor works [511–516] which discussed whether Anderson localization [391] can survive interactions. A new paradigm has then emerged for many-body eigenstates of strongly disordered interacting systems which may not obey the ‘‘eigenstate thermalization hypothesis’’ (ETH) [517–519] and would fail to thermalize [520]. Such a many-body localization (MBL) clearly challenges the very foundations of quantum statistical physics [520,521] as thermalization in such closed systems cannot occur without external bath (for a recent discussion, see also Ref. [522]). Another interesting property is that MBL may lead to long-range (possibly topological) order, otherwise absent for equilibrated systems [523–527]. Furthermore, the MBL shows some similarities with integrable systems, with an extensive number of quasi-local integrals of motion [528–531].
Several numerical studies have recently focused on the MBL phase, and associated phase transitions. Most of the studied
models are one-dimensional, mostly for practical reasons: e.g. the random field Heisenberg or XXZ chain [532–536], d = 1
interacting fermions [526,537,538] (relevant to the recent experiments [539] on quasi-periodic chains [540]), quantum Ising chains [523,527,541], spin-glasses [542], and also translationally-invariant models [543–546], or driven systems [547].
While exact diagonalization is typically limited to ∼20 sites [536], larger systems can also be studied using approximate
methods such as strong disorder RG techniques, the so-called RSRG-X method [527,548–550], or Matrix Product States approaches exploiting the low entanglement property of the MBL regime [551–555]. However, these techniques are practically limited to strong disorder on the MBL side of the phase diagram where they are well controlled. At weaker disorder, in the ergodic regime, only exact numerical approaches are expected to give quantitatively reliable results.
A canonical example of interacting model which exhibits a MBL transition is the random field Heisenberg s = 1/2 chain,15

where the random field is drawn from a uniform distribution in [−h, h]. Using a spectral transformation, this model has been studied by exact diagonalization at varying energy densities across the entire spectrum up to L = 22 spins [536] in

order to extract the many-body mobility edge shown in Fig. 43.

Because the MBL phenomenon leads to the absence of thermalization, we do not expect any sort of thermodynamic

signatures of a localization/delocalization transition in finite temperature observables. Instead, the transition has to be

studied either at infinite temperature, i.e. with all eigenstates equally weighted [533,537], or by targeting eigenstates at

finite energy density above the ground-state [536,541], which is better justified for systems having a many-body mobility
edge at finite energy density ϵ (Fig. 43). Another possibility to study such a dynamical transition is to make a global quench

from a high-energy unentangled product state [528,534].

Numerical studies of the many-body eigenstates provide a very precise and quantitative way to characterize the

localized/delocalized nature of the system. For example, a popular way to differentiate extended and localized phases relies

on the spectral statistics from random matrix theory [556]. As exploited in several works [513,514,533,536,537,542,557], the

ergodic regime harbors a statistical distribution of level spacings which follows Wigner’s surmise of the Gaussian orthogonal

ensemble (GOE), while a Poisson distribution is expected for localized states. At the transition, it is not clear whether there

is a continuous family of critical theories [542] or semi-Poisson statistics [558–560].

The level statistics properties are summarized in Table 3, together with entanglement features across the different regimes. Below we discuss in detail how entangled are the eigenstates in both delocalized and MBL regimes, as well as at the transition between the two regimes. We first focus on physics at equilibrium, looking at eigenstates for which a clear transition from a volume to an area law scaling of the entropy is observed. Then, the non-equilibrium situation is examined through quantum quenches, starting from high-energy untangled states.

4.3.2. Area vs. volume law for highly excited states
Thermalization in isolated quantum systems implies that the system itself acts as its own heat bath [563]. This is the case for the so-called ergodic regime (adjacent of the MBL phase, see Fig. 43) where ETH [517,518] is expected to hold. In this delocalized phase, the RDM of a high energy eigenstate can be viewed as a thermal density matrix at high temperature. Therefore, the entanglement entropy of such a highly excited eigenstate is very close to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at high temperature, thus exhibiting a volume-law scaling. Such delocalized eigenstates can therefore be described as pure random states [564]. Volume-law entanglement at high temperature has been verified for disorder-free quantum spin chains [463,565–568], as well as for the ergodic regime of weakly disordered chains [526,536,541].
4.3.2.1. Many-body localization. On the other hand, contrary to the thermal phase, the MBL regime does not obey ETH [533] and the eigenstates sustain a much smaller (area law) entanglement, qualitatively closer to the entanglement entropy of a ground-state [13]. Such qualitatively distinct properties have been clearly shown numerically in various exact diagonalization studies [526,536,541]. In Fig. 44(a–b) exact diagonalization results of model Eq. (4.12) are shown for the disorder-average von Neumann entropy of half-chains for eigenstates lying in the middle of the many-body spectrum
(ϵ = 0.5 in Fig. 43) as a function of size L and disorder strength h. The transition from volume to sub-volume scaling is
clearly visible, as provided by the scaling plot in panel (b). Numerical data are compatible with a volume-law entanglement entropy at criticality [561], and with a strict area law scaling for the MBL regime (dashed line in panel (b) of Fig. 44).16 Breakdown of the area law at the delocalization transition was recently exploited in a numerical linked cluster expansion study [570] to locate the MBL transition.17

16 In the MBL regime, Bauer and Nayak [526] reported a weak logarithmic violation of the area law for the maximum entropy, obtained from the (sample-
dependent) optimal bipartition. A logarithmic violation was also found using matrix product states [569].
17 This study concluded for a critical boundary hc (ϵ) larger than the one of Fig. 43 from [536].

Another very interesting point concerns the entropy histograms, as discussed in Refs. [526,536,541,571,572], for which
a qualitative change is observed across the different regimes. The evolution of the standard deviation σE with increasing system length L provides a quantitative tool, plotted in Fig. 44(c–d). While in the delocalized regime σE(L) → 0 (in agreement
with Ref. [573]), it remains constant in the localized phase, and diverges with L at the transition. This is likely a signature of an absence of self-averaging for the entropy, and a possible signature of infinite randomness physics at criticality [574].
A quite surprising feature concerns the structure of the ES, as explored by Yang and co-workers [575] for high-energy levels in both ETH and MBL regimes. In the delocalized phase, they found a ‘‘two-component’’ structure of the entanglement levels, with a universal part corresponding to genuine random states [564], and a non-universal (model-dependent) part. Interestingly, the universal part lies in the ‘‘high-energy’’ sector of the ES, in contrast with usual expectations (see Section 3). The universal fraction decreases when the MBL transitions are approached and vanishes in the MBL regime. This observed effect for high-energy eigenstates clearly contrasts with ground-states of either pure [267,268] or disordered systems [576] for which the universal part (if it exists [289]) is rather expected in the ‘‘low-energy’’ part. However, it is not excluded that such a two-component structure will vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Spectral statistics of the entanglement levels, studied in Ref. [577], shows GOE statistics in the delocalized regime while an intriguing semi-Poisson behavior was found in the MBL regime. Interestingly, Serbyn and co-workers have found a power-law decay of the ES in the MBL phase, with a decay exponent related to the localization length [578].
4.3.2.2. Random bonds. SU(2)k anyonic chains [579] with random bonds [422–424] have also been studied in their
high-energy regime [550], using RSRG-X techniques [548]. The well-known Ising (k = 2), Potts (k = 4), and Heisenberg (k = ∞) cases are included in this family of models. In contrast with the random field case Eq. (4.12), Vasseur and
co-workers [550] have found for random SU(2)k chains a set of infinite randomness fixed points that are the infinitetemperature analogs of Damle–Huse fixed points [420]. The entanglement entropy of high-energy eigenstates, sketched
in Fig. 45, displays a crossover from a volume-law scaling ∼ L at small lengths L ≪ k to the asymptotic regime ∼ ln L for L ≫ ξk(2) ∼ exp(k3/4π 2). This logarithmic asymptotic behavior is also confirmed for the quantum Ising case k = 2 by
Huang and Moore in Ref. [549]. Consequences for the Heisenberg case are interesting since we expect volume-law entropy
and self-thermalization only in this k → ∞ limit. Note also that for random-bonds XXZ chains, the strong disorder MBL
regime is of spin-glass type with a strict area law entropy, as found in [580].
4.3.3. Entanglement growth after global quantum quenches The spreading in time of entanglement after a quantum quench is a topic which has attracted a huge amount of work,
in the wake of nonequilibrium dynamics in isolated interacting quantum systems [581]. For integrable systems, it was

originally shown [582,583] that the block entropy grows linearly with time S(t) ∼ t after a sudden global quench,18
using both analytical (CFT) and numerical (exact diagonalization and time-dependent DMRG). This was also confirmed for
non-integrable systems [586] where the ballistic growth of S(t) contrasts with energy transport which is diffusive.
Intuitively, due to the finite velocity of excitations we expect a finite velocity of propagation of information in quantum
systems with local interactions, resulting in a Lieb–Robinson bound for entanglement spreading [587,588]: S(t) ≤ vLRt.
Quite remarkably, Burrell and Osborne have shown that for disordered XY spin chains [589], the effective light cone grows
much slower ∼ ln t, thus yielding an entanglement spreading at most growing logarithmically with time, at least for
non-interacting disordered fermionic chains.
We now discuss in detail these properties of entanglement spreading in disordered interacting quantum systems after
a global quench, starting at t = 0 from a high-energy untangled product state |Ψ (0)⟩, and letting the system evolve under the unitary evolution exp(−iHt)|Ψ (0)⟩.

4.3.3.1. Logarithmic scaling in quantum glass phases and in the MBL regime. One of the first numerical observations of a slow

logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy after a global quench in disordered systems was achieved by De Chiara and

co-workers [583] for XX spin chains with random bonds,19 following a quench from the simple (high-energy) Néel state

| ↑↓↑↓ . . .⟩. A very slow spreading of entanglement S(t) ∼ ln(ln t) was also observed for the disordered transverse field

Ising chain [590], with a saturation value at long time ∼ ln L. However, when interactions are turned on, Vosk and Altman

have shown using a dynamical RG approach [528] for random bonds XXZ (in the easy-plane regime) that starting from the

state,

a modified logarithmic growth S(t) ∼ (ln t)1/ψk is expected [527,550], with an exponent ψk < 1 which depends on the
nature of the quantum critical glass phase. For the general class of SU(2)k quantum critical anyonic glasses [422–424,550],
the non-trivial tunneling exponent for excited states ψk has also been computed by Vasseur and co-workers [550]. For the Heisenberg SU(2) point, ψk→∞ → 0, yielding a faster growth for S(t).
It is interesting to remark that interactions lead to an entanglement growth which exceeds the upper bound ∝ ln t proved

for disordered free-fermions [589]. Moreover, the large time asymptotic value is a volume-law St→∞ ∼ L, albeit with a small
(non-thermal) prefactor, and which may also depend on the initial state [591], as well as on disorder strength. Nevertheless,

the SU(2) Heisenberg case is special since RG breaks down [528,550,592] and ETH may still hold.

The situation also changes drastically (as compared to non-interacting) for random fields or random potentials [528,532,

534,593–595]. This is illustrated in Fig. 46 where we see that only infinitesimal interactions yield an unbounded growth

of entanglement entropy [534] in the random field XXZ chain, in great contrast with free fermions for which the entropy

quickly saturates to a strict area law. Interactions induce dephasing [529,594] and give rise to a classical picture based on

the so-called ‘‘l-bits’’ representation for the MBL regime [520]. Distant spins are weakly coupled V (ℓ) ∼ exp(−ℓ/ξ ) and

therefore get slowly entangled, after a long time ln t ∼ ℓ, leading to a very slow entanglement growth

SMBL(t) ∝ ln t,

(4.13)

up to saturation to a volume-law.20 The above scaling has a prefactor which is controlled by both the initial state before the

quench and the localization length in the MBL phase [591]. This dephasing is triggered by the interactions, as confirmed for

long-range interacting models [596] where the entanglement growth is faster, algebraic in time with an exponent controlled by the power-law interaction.21 Below, we summarize in Table 4 the different behaviors of entanglement entropy growth

after a global quench from a non-entangled initial product state in the strongly disordered regime of various models. At the

MBL–ETH transition, while the l-bits picture breaks down, logarithmic spreading is still expected as a consequence of the
infinite randomness nature of this critical point with a tunneling exponent ψ = 1 [574].

18 There is a qualitative difference between global and local quenches [584]. While the former displays ballistic spreading of entanglement, the later
exhibits a much slower logarithmic growth [585]. 19 And no random field, thus preserving the particle–hole symmetry of the Hamiltonian for which we do not expect Anderson localization. 20 This does not mean an equilibrated thermal state though. 21 This is relevant for dipolar cold gases, good candidates for observing MBL [597–599].

4.3.3.2. Sub-ballistic entanglement growth in the delocalized regime. Upon decreasing the disorder strength, the (dynamical) transition from the MBL phase to the ETH regime displays sharp signatures in the entanglement growth properties, changing from a slow logarithmic spreading to a ballistic growth expected in the absence of disorder [582,583,586]. Asking whether ballistic spreading holds in the entire delocalized ETH regime, numerical [600–605] and analytical [574,606,607] works have revealed the existence of an intermediate delocalized regime where the dynamical response is anomalously slow. Sometimes dubbed ‘‘sub-diffusive’’, this regime is expected close to criticality in one dimension where the entanglement
spreading may be blocked by bottlenecks made of rare critical segments of length λ. In such ‘‘Griffiths’’ [608] regions, the entanglement spreading is drastically slowed, and occurs on time scales ln t ∼ λ. For a system of length L, the longest of such rare regions typically scales λ∗ ∼ ξ ln(L/ξ ) [574,606], ξ being a characteristic length diverging at the transition. Therefore the waiting time for entanglement spreading is dominated by τ ∗ ∼ Lξ/a, yielding

S(t) ∼ t1/z ,

(4.14)

with a dynamical exponent z ∼ ξ diverging when the ETH–MBL transition is approached, in agreement with infinite randomness (z = ∞) and a logarithmic growth at the transition.
This sub-ballistic entanglement spreading was verified numerically [603] using a Krylov space method allowing to
perform exact diagonalization calculations for random-field Heisenberg chains Eq. (4.12) up to L = 28 sites. Results [603]
are displayed in Fig. 47 where the slow algebraic growth of the von Neumann entropy after a sudden quench from an initial

non-entangled basis state is clearly visible.22 The dynamical exponent z is extracted as a function of the disorder strength h of the random longitudinal field, and plotted in Fig. 47(e).
The anomalous sub-ballistic regime for the entanglement entropy inside the ETH phase is found to persist in an extended parameter region, seemingly down to very small h. At first sight, this seems hard to reconcile with the fact that a sub-diffusive regime is attached to rare Griffiths regions [574,600,606], thus only expected close to the MBL transition. One should remember however that in the quench protocol, inhomogeneity is also present in the initial product state where energy density fluctuates locally leading to anomalously ‘‘hot’’ and ‘‘cold’’ regions. The presence of a mobility edge [536] in the random-field Heisenberg model Eq. (4.12) may be responsible for such a large extension for the anomalous dynamical regime observed in Ref. [603] using such a global quench protocol.
4.3.4. Open questions An important open issue concerns experimentally relevant realizations of MBL. While very new, it appears to become
a flourishing field with a growing number of striking proposals, coming either from traditional condensed matter systems [609] or from quantum gas labs [539,610–612]. The measurement of entanglement growth in cold atom setups is in principle possible (see next section) using newly developed techniques [613]. For systems of trapped ionic chains with controlled disorder, the growth of quantum Fisher information [614] (giving a lower bound on the entanglement) has been measured [610].
Logarithmic entanglement spreading is expected to be the smoking gun of MBL, but one should ask whether the sub-ballistic growth found in most of the delocalized regime [603] is a generic feature in the presence of disorder, or is it model-dependent? A natural question follows regarding a possible transition between a ballistic and a sub-ballistic regime for entanglement spreading inside the delocalized regime.
Another important open issue touches the question of the nature of the localized–delocalized transition and the possible ergodicity breaking at the transition, as well as in its vicinity [559,561,615].
Finally, let us also mention the interesting and strongly debated question of MBL in disorder-free systems [543–546, 616–620].
5. Towards entanglement measurement
Experimental detection of entanglement is a vast topic [621] for which many different setups have been explored [622–634]. Among them, bulk solid-state systems, where correlations and quantum entanglement usually go hand in hand [353], are potentially interesting systems to measure and exploit entanglement. Strongly correlated phases and quantum dynamics can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement, as for instance discussed for the dipolar
spin glass LiHoxY1−xF4 [624], spin-1/2 antiferromagnets CN[Cu(NO3)2 · 2.5D2O] [635–637] or [Cu(DCOO)2 · 4D2O] [638],
supramolecular antiferromagnetic rings (Purple-Cr7Ni) [639], Kondo screening in atomic chains [640], and more generally in neutron scattering experiments [641,642]. Similar signatures are also expected for optical lattice experiments [643].
22 In order to respect the energy-resolved character of this ETH–MBL transition discussed above (see Fig. 43 for the mobility edge extracted in [536]), the quenched states are chosen to be in the middle of the spectrum.

Long-distance entanglement between solid-state qubits is also a major issue for quantum communication schemes [5,644]. In this context, spin networks have been proposed to be promising setups to realize a quantum data bus [645–649]. Interestingly, the spin-ladder compound Sr14Cu24O41 (see Fig. 48) [650] appears to be a good candidate for long-range entanglement between unpaired spins which gets entangled at low temperature, coupled by an effective coupling Jeff across
ℓ = 220–250 Å [651], as sketched in Fig. 48.
Nevertheless, in most of these works the low-temperature entanglement is seen through few-body correlations that are measured using standard solid-state physics probe, such as heat capacity, susceptibility, neutron scattering. It is however much more difficult to access many-body entanglement estimates, like the entanglement entropy for instance. In the rest of this section we discuss the few proposals that have been recently discussed, either using noise and fluctuations in solid-state and mesoscopic systems, or in cold atom experiments.

5.1. Quantum noise and bipartite fluctuations

Fluctuations of globally conserved quantities, such as the number of particles for U(1) symmetric itinerant systems, or the total magnetization for O(2) magnets, are key measurable quantities which can reflect the amount of entanglement present in a subsystem. First discussed in the context of mesoscopic systems [652–657], the link between entanglement entropy and bipartite fluctuations has been explored later by several authors [90–98,100,101,103,155,658,659].
Below we first describe free fermions where there is an exact correspondence between cumulants and entanglement entropies [91,94,95]. Then we discuss interacting systems in one dimension, and beyond. While there is a quantitative link for Luttinger liquids between bipartite fluctuations and entanglement entropy [93,95,275], this is no longer true for interacting two-dimensional systems [155], although quantum critical points can be detected using fluctuations [97]. We finally address the key issue of experimental detection for nano- or meso-electronic devices such as quantum point contacts and also for more traditional solid-state bulk systems such as quantum magnets.

5.1.1. Bipartitefluctuation as an entanglement meter

5.1.1.1. Free fermions. For systems that can be mapped to non-interacting fermions, the entanglement entropy can be accessed experimentally through the full counting statistics of a conserved U(1) charge, such as the particle number N for instance when studying the charge transfer across mesoscopic conductors [104,660–662]. The idea of using quantum noise as an entanglement meter, first proposed by Klich and Levitov [91] following a local quench, was further explored by Song and co-workers for both out-of-equilibrium and at equilibrium [94,95] who derived exact expressions Eq. (5.3) for the von Neumann and the Rényi entropies in terms of cumulants Cn. The second cumulant C2, also called the fluctuations is defined by

F = ⟨(NA − ⟨NA⟩)2⟩

(5.1)

where ⟨NA⟩ is the ground-state expectation value of the particle number in a subsystem A. Higher order cumulants, defined
by

Cn = (−i∂λ)n ln χ (λ)|λ=0,

where the generating function χ (λ) = ⟨exp(iλNA)⟩, enter in the following expansions [94,95], only involving even cumulant

5.1.1.2. Interacting systems: Luttinger liquids. For one-dimensional critical (zero-temperature) Luttinger liquids, taking a
subsystem of length ℓ, its RDM can be described as the thermal density matrix of an open Luttinger liquid with the same velocity u and Luttinger parameter K [275,276] at an effective low temperature Tent = u ln(ℓ/ℓ0)/(π ℓ), where ℓ0 is an
order one length scale. Ignoring irrelevant corrections, a Luttinger liquid is equivalent to a free boson model whose partition

in agreement with previous works [93].
The logarithmic scaling Eq. (5.7) of the bipartite fluctuations C2(ℓ) can be checked for using DMRG or QMC simulations [93,95]. Here we show QMC results in the ground-state of spin-1/2 XXZ chains in the antiferromagnetic critical regime for C2 of half-chains ℓ = L/2 in Fig. 49 for various anisotropies ∆ and sizes L = 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. In the entire antiferromagnetic critical regime ∆ ∈ [0, 1] the scaling of C2 is logarithmic, while it tends to saturate once ∆ > 1, as clearly visible in the left panel of Fig. 49. A logarithmic fit of the QMC data to the form C2 = Keff/π 2 ln L + constant yields estimates
for the Luttinger parameters plotted in the right part of Fig. 49, in very good agreement with the exact expression known
from Bethe ansatz Eq. (3.2).
It is fair to say that the second cumulant is a quite simple observable to measure within QMC or DMRG simulations. It
therefore provides a very interesting quantity to access the Luttinger liquid parameter K when it is unknown. Conversely,
if the value of K at a quantum critical point gc is known but the precise value of gc is not, we will see below that measuring the second cumulant C2 provides a very efficient way to estimate the critical coupling.

5.1.2. Bipartite fluctuations to detect quantum criticality

5.1.2.1. One dimension: Luttinger liquids. Following the previous discussion, we show how efficient the use of Eq. (5.7) is to locate 1D quantum critical points with a high accuracy.

where we define λ = J2/J1 ≥ 0. For λ ≤ λc , this model has power-law critical correlations and a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy Eq. (2.3), while at λc ≃ 0.2412 a Berezinsky–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) transition into a dimerized phase occurs [477,479,663] where the entropy obeys a strict area law (see Fig. 2).

entropy turns out to be very difficult, as explored by Alet and co-workers in [664]. This is illustrated in Fig. 50 where the effective (size-dependent) central charge, estimated from DMRG data for various system sizes, is plotted against the
frustrated coupling λ. The crossing of the data to the value ceff = 1, expected to occur at λc where irrelevant logarithmic
corrections vanish [475] is very difficult to detect, and in practice less precise as compared to spin–spin correlation function [477].
The effect of marginal corrections is much more pronounced in the bipartite fluctuations of the magnetization which involve the uniform part of the spin correlations inside subsystem A

C2 = [⟨Siz Sjz ⟩ − ⟨Siz ⟩⟨Sjz ⟩]

(5.10)

where additive logarithmic corrections are well-known [665]. Fitting DMRG data to the form Eq. (5.7), one can extract an
effective (size-dependent) Luttinger parameter as a function of λ. This is plotted in the left panel of Fig. 51 where one clearly sees the vanishing of the marginal corrections leading to Kc = 0.5 at λc = 0.2412(3), in perfect agreement with the best estimate λc = 0.241167(5) [477].

where t is the hopping amplitude, U the on-site repulsion, and µ the chemical potential chosen such that ⟨ni⟩ = 1 in the
ground-state. For unit filling, the quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator is of BKT type [668]. The
exponent governing the algebraic decay of the Green’s function ⟨bĎr b0⟩ ∝ r−1/2K in the superfluid phase K ≥ 2 jumps at the transition from Kc = 2 to 0 in the Mott insulator [269]. The precise determination of the critical ratio (t/U)c turns
out to be very difficult using finite size numerics, as summarized in Table 5 and Fig. 52. As discussed in detail in [97],
bipartite fluctuations of the particle number provide a very simple and efficient tool to detect the transition with a very
high accuracy, as shown in panel right of Fig. 51. The Luttinger parameter K is extracted from fitting C2 to Eq. (5.7) for

various sizes L = 64, 128, and 256 (the latter is shown in Fig. 51). By performing finite size scaling we obtain a very precise estimate λc = 0.2989(2), in good agreement with the most reliable estimates (see Table 5 and Fig. 52). Note that the
bipartite fluctuations allow to estimate the critical point with a very high accuracy, the numerical cost being quite low.

This model displays two gapped rung-singlet phases if the inter-ladder coupling λ1c > λ > λ2c with λ1c = 0.31407(5) [381] and λ2c = 1.9096(2) [384], and a gapless Néel ordered phase in between, as shown in Fig. 53(a). T = 0 fluctuations of the total magnetization in a sub-system A of size L/2 × L, embedded in a periodic square lattice L × L are shown in Fig. 53 (b-c), with square lattices size up to L × L = 104, for the isotropic square lattice λ = 1 (Néel) and for weakly coupled ladders with λ = 0.1 (gapped rung singlet I). In contrast with the entanglement (or Rényi) entropy which displays a strict area law both
phases, the second cumulant follows different scalings [94]:

Therefore, F /ℓ plotted for different sizes displays a crossing point at λc , as observed in panel (c) of Fig. 53. The spin stiffness ρs, also known to be a useful quantity to locate quantum criticality, is shown in the right inset (ii) of Fig. 53(c) where a similar crossing is observed for ρs × Ld+z−2, with z = 1 and d = 2. As usual for such a technique, a drift of the crossing
point is observed with L, as visible in the left inset (i) of Fig. 53(b). Already known for a few other models [382,384], the
crossing points obtained from the stiffness converge very rapidly with 1/L to the bulk value λc , whereas we found a slower convergence for the estimates obtained from F /L. Despite such effect (which may not be generic but model dependent),
this simple example clearly shows that F is a very useful quantity to locate a quantum critical point between ordered and disordered phases for d > 1.

5.1.3. Experimental proposal
5.1.3.1. Quantum point contact. A quantum point contact is a beam splitter with tunable transmission and reflection that serves as a ‘‘door’’ between electron reservoirs [91,155], as depicted in Fig. 54. Time fluctuations of the current measured at this quantum point contact are exactly the bipartite fluctuations when replacing the temporal window t by the spatial extent x. Due to space–time duality, such a replacement is always allowed for conformally invariant systems [94], even when they are interacting. Quantum point contacts with free-electron reservoirs offer the opportunity to directly measure entanglement entropy. The first few cumulants, in particular C2, have already been successfully measured [680–682].

screens. Sketched in Fig. 55, such screens would eliminate the external field as well as the magnetic response outside region

A. By varying the size of A and extrapolating to very low temperature, the scaling of FA could be measured.

5.2. Entanglement detection and measure in cold atom experiments

Quantum information processing using cold atoms trapped in optical lattices has been intensively discussed by many authors [683–688]. Recently, theoretical proposals to directly extract entanglement witnesses, such as the Rényi entropies, have been debated in the context of artificial matter loaded in optical lattices. Below, we discuss the few theoretical proposals that have been suggested in the context of ultra-cold atoms, and present the very first experimental achievements.

5.2.1. Theoretical proposals using SWAP-based protocols Using previous ideas based on copying a quantum system q times [689], and applying a SWAP operation [184,690,
691], Abanin and Demler [692] proposed a general method to measure q-Rényi entropies for integer q ≥ 2. The idea

Fig. 56. Proposal for measuring the q = 2 Rényi entropy, inspired from Abanin and Demler [692]. Two identical copies are split in pairs of half-chains arranged in a cross geometry. A quantum switch (two-level system ↑ or ↓ at the center) controls the way in which the half-chains are connected by selectively allowing tunneling to one of the neighbors. The ground-states overlap Eq. (5.15) of the two configurations is directly proportional to the q = 2
Rényi entropy, and can be measured by studying Rabi oscillations of the quantum switch.

is based on the SWAP protocol, illustrated in Fig. 56 for q = 2 copies of a one-dimensional system partitioned in two

parts A1,2 and B1,2, controlled by a two-level system which plays the role of a quantum switch. Writing the ground-states

the

two configurations (a) and (b) in Fig. 56, the second Rényi entropy is given by the overlap

(5.15)

In order to evaluate this overlap, a weak tunneling is introduced between the two states of the quantum switch, leading to a
hybridization of the two ground-states: |GS⟩⊗| ↑⟩ and |GS′⟩⊗| ↓⟩. Studying Rabi oscillations of the quantum switch between
the two ground-states gives a direct access to overlap Eq. (5.15) which is directly proportional to the Rabi frequency. In the same time, Daley and co-workers [693] proposed a slightly different but related theoretical setup where
entanglement growth is tracked during a quench dynamics of two identical copies of a boson chain whose mutual coupling is reduced. After tunneling has occurred, a measurement of the SWAP operator is achieved by measuring the parity number.

5.2.2. First measurements
Based on some earlier theoretical proposals [694,695], Islam et al. [613] realized the first measurement of the second Rényi entropy by making interference between two copies of a 4-site Bose–Hubbard chain in an optical lattice. Building on the quantum gas microscope technique [696,697], the second moment of the RDM (the purity) is accessed without resorting to quantum tomography [698]. Using a 50%–50% beam splitter the purity is directly estimated by measuring the average particle number parity. The measured second Rényi entropy is shown across the superfluid–insulator transition in Fig. 57.
Using a different protocol, essentially based on particle number fluctuations [699], Fukuhara and co-workers [700] have measured two-site entanglement between the spins of ultra-cold atoms loaded in an optical lattice. Starting with a localized spin-flip excitation, the time evolution of the concurrence between distant spins has been recorded through the measure of transverse spin correlations.
Note also that the quantum Fisher information [614], already addressed in the context of many-body localization of trapped ions [610], has been recently discussed by Hauke and co-workers [701]. There, they made a striking theoretical proposal for accessing quantum Fisher information via a direct measurement of dynamical susceptibilities.

6. Conclusion
6.1. Summary
In this review we have tried to give a general, while non-exhaustive, survey of the flourishing recent activity in the field of quantum entanglement in condensed matter physics, focusing on bipartite entanglement for clean and disordered systems.
Let us briefly summarize the main results we have reviewed. The ground-state of most correlated quantum systems exhibits an area law entanglement entropy, at most logarithmically enhanced for Luttinger, Fermi or Bose liquids. While the area law prefactor is expected to display a cusp singularity at quantum critical points, universality is encoded in sub-dominant terms, such as additive constants or corner contributions. Symmetry breakings or topological order can be clearly identified through such sub-leading corrections beyond area law in generalized Rényi entanglement entropies.

Regarding entanglement spectroscopy, we have seen that entanglement levels can contain more information than the
entropies, and the ‘‘low-energy’’ part carries some universality for 1 + 1 conformal field theory, gapped states, broken
symmetry phases, topological order. Quantum disordered systems such as random spin models, quantum (Kondo) impurity problems, or many-body localized systems all display fascinating entanglement properties. The most recent example being the many-body localization problem where highly excited states exhibit a dynamical transition between ergodic and non-ergodic regimes with qualitatively different entanglement properties, as well as anomalous entanglement spreading following a global quantum quench. On the experimental side, bipartite fluctuations in mesoscopic and solid state systems represent a promising tool to measure entanglement, as well as recent realizations in ultra-cold atom experiments.

6.2. Open questions
Let us give some directions towards a few open questions. The recently debated universality of entanglement spectra remains a largely open issue, leading to the question of the conditions under which an entanglement spectrum is universal. A particularly interesting aspect is the spatial variation of the entanglement temperature, decaying away from the (real-space) cut for area law ground states.
Another key point concerns the computational aspects of entanglement in strongly correlated systems, in particular for highly entangled states for which going beyond brute force exact diagonalization (restricted to small systems) is a central issue, in particular to understand ergodicity breaking in interacting disordered systems at high energy. Systems with long-range couplings, relevant to cold atom experiments, are also very challenging for numerics since ground-state entanglement is no longer bounded to an area law.
Several aspects remain to be understood for d ≥ 2 systems, in particular for non-Fermi liquid states where the logarithmic
enhancement of the area law appears to be related but distinct from the free-fermion result. Shape dependence is also a very
interesting topic where for instance in d = 2 corner contributions carry a universal additive logarithmic correction in the
entropy for conformal field theories. However, is universality in such corner terms also present at disordered quantum critical points?
Finally, the idea of a quantum revolution promoted by X.-G. Wen [702] where there is unification between matter and quantum information is a very attractive one, but whether or not the standard model does emerge from long-ranged entangled qubits remains certainly an open issue.
