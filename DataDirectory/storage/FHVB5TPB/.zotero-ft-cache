Preface
This instructor’s manual for the third edition of Statistical Mechanics is based on RKP’s instructor’s manual for the second edition. Most of the solutions here were retypeset into TeX from that manual. PDB is responsible for the solutions of the new problems added in the third edition. The result is a manual containing solutions to some 280 problems selected from the third edition.
The original idea of producing an instructor’s manual ﬁrst came from RKP’s friend and colleague Wing-Ki Liu in the 1990’s when RKP had just embarked on the task of preparing the second edition of Statistical Mechanics.
This should provide several beneﬁts to the statistical mechanics instructor. First of all, there is the obvious advantage of saving time that one would otherwise spend on solving these problems oneself. Secondly, before one selects problems either for homework or for an exam, one can consult the manual to determine the level of diﬃculty of the various problems and make one’s selection accordingly. Thirdly, one may even use some of these solved problems, especially the ones appearing in later chapters, as lecture material, thereby supplementing the text. We hope that this manual will enhance the usefulness of the text – both for the instructors and (indirectly) for the students.
We implore that instructors not share copies of any of the material in this manual with students or post any part of this manual on the web. Students learn best when they work together and struggle over diﬃcult problems. Readily available solutions interfere with this crucial aspect of graduate physics training.

Chapter 1

1.1. (a) We expand the quantity ln Ω(0)(E1) as a Taylor series in the variable (E1 − E¯1) and get

ln Ω(0)(E1) ≡ lnΩ1(E1) + ln Ω2(E2) = {ln Ω1(E¯1) + ln Ω2(E¯2)}+

∂ ln Ω1(E1) + ∂ ln Ω2(E2) ∂E2

(E1−E¯1)2,

with T1 = T2. Ignoring the subsequent terms (which is justiﬁed if the systems involved are large) and taking the exponentials, we readily see that the function Ω0(E1) is a Gaussian in the variable (E1 − E¯1), with variance kT 2(Cv)1(Cv)2/{(Cv)1 + (Cv)2}. Note that if (Cv)2 (Cv)1 — corresponding to system 1 being in thermal contact with a very large reservoir — then the variance becomes simply kT 2(Cv)1, regardless of the nature of the reservoir; cf. eqn. (3.6.3).

cf. Problem 3.18.

1.2. Since S is additive and Ω multiplicative, the function f (Ω) must satisfy

the condition

f (Ω1Ω2) = f (Ω1) + f (Ω2).

(1)

1

2

Diﬀerentiating (1) with respect to Ω1 (and with respect to Ω2), we get

Ω2f (Ω1Ω2) = f (Ω1) and Ω1f (Ω1Ω2) = f (Ω2),

so that

Ω1f (Ω1) = Ω2f (Ω2).

(2)

Since the left-hand side of (2) is independent of Ω2 and the right-hand side is independent of Ω1, each side must be equal to a constant, k, independent of both Ω1 and Ω2. It follows that f (Ω) = k/Ω and hence

f (Ω) = k ln Ω + const.

(3)

Substituting (3) into (1), we ﬁnd that the constant of integration is zero.

1.4. Instead of eqn. (1.4.1), we now have

Ω ∝ V (V − v0)(V − 2v0) . . . (V − N − 1v0),

so that

ln Ω = C + ln V + ln (V − v0) + ln (V − 2v0) + . . . + ln (V − N − 1v0),

where C is independent of V . The expression on the right may be written as

1.5. This problem is essentially solved in Appendix A; all that remains to be done is to substitute from eqn. (B.12) into (B.11), to get

Substituting V = L3 and S = 6L2, we obtain eqns. (1.4.15 and 16). The expression for T now follows straightforwardly; we get

1.11. Clearly, the initial temperatures and the initial particle densities of the two gases (and hence of the mixture) are the same. The entropy of mixing may, therefore, be obtained from eqn. (1.5.4), with N1 = 4NA and N2 = NA. We get
(∆S)∗ = k[4NA ln(5/4) + NA ln 5] = R[4 ln(5/4) + ln 5] = 2.502 R,

which is equivalent to about 0.5 R per mole of the mixture.

1.12. (a) The expression in question is given by eqn. (1.5.3a). Without loss of generality, we may keep N1, N2 and V1 ﬁxed and vary only V2 . The ﬁrst and second derivatives of this expression are then given by

k N1 + N2 − N2 V1 + V2 V2

and

k

−

N1 (V1

+ N2 + V2)2

+

N2 V22

(1a,b)

respectively. Equating (1a) to zero gives the desired condition, viz. N1V2 = N2V1, i.e. N1/V1 = N2/V2 = n, say. Expression (1b) then reduces to

n

n

k−

+=

kn V1

> 0.

V1 + V2 V2 V2(V1 + V2)

Clearly, (∆S)1≡2 is at its minimum when N1/V1 = N2/V2, and it is straightforward to check that the value at the minimum is zero.

4

(b) The expression now in question is given by eqn. (1.5.4). With N1 = αN and N2 = (1 − α)N , where N = N1 + N2 (which is ﬁxed), the expression for (∆S)∗/k takes the form
−αN ln α − (1 − α)N ln (1 − α).

The ﬁrst and second derivatives of this expression with respect to α are

NN [−N ln α + N ln(1 − α)] and − −
α 1−α

(2a,b)

respectively. Equating (2a) to zero gives the condition α = 1/2, which reduces (2b) to −4N . Clearly, (∆S)∗/k is at its maximum when N1 = N2 = (1/2)N , and it is straightforward to check that the value at the maximum is N ln 2.

1.13. Proceeding with eqn. (1.5.1), with T replaced by Ti, it is straightforward to see that the extra contribution to ∆S, owing to the fact that T1 = T2, is given by the expression

3

3

2 N1k ln (Tf /T1) + 2 N2k ln(Tf /T2),

where Tf = (N1T1 + N2T2)/(N1 + N2). It is worth checking that this expression is always greater than or equal to zero, the equality holding if and only if T1 = T2. Furthermore, the result quoted here does not depend on whether the two gases were diﬀerent or identical.

1.14. By eqn. (1.5.1a), given on page 19 of the text, we get

3

(∆S)v

=

Nk 2

ln(Tf /Ti).

Now, since PV = NkT , the same equation may also be written as

kT 3 5

2πmkT

S = Nk ln

+ Nk + ln

P 23

h2

.

(1b)

It follows that

5

5

(∆S)P

=

Nk 2

ln(Tf

/ Ti) = 3 (∆S)V.

A numerical veriﬁcation of this result is straightforward.

It should be noted that, quite generally,

(∆S)P = T (∂S / ∂T )P = CP = γ (∆S)V T (∂S / ∂T )V CV

which, in the present case, happens to be 5/3.

5

1.15. For an ideal gas, CP − CV = nR, where n is the number of moles of the gas. With CP /CV = γ, one gets

CP = γnR / (γ − 1) and CV = nR / (γ − 1). For a mixture of two ideal gases,

CV

=

n1R γ1 − 1

+

n2R γ2 − 1

=

f1 + f2 γ1 − 1 γ2 − 1

(n1 + n2)R.

Equating this to the conventional expression (n1 + n2)R/(γ − 1), we get the desired result.

1.16. In view of eqn. (1.3.15), E − TS + PV = µN . It follows that

dE − TdS − SdT + PdV + VdP = µdN + Nd µ. Combining this with eqn. (1.3.4), we get
−SdT + VdP = Nd µ, i.e. dP = (N / V )dµ + (S / V )dT . Clearly, then,
(∂P / ∂µ)T = N / V and (∂P / ∂T )µ = S / V.

Now, for the ideal gas

see eqn. (1.5.7). Eliminating (N/V ), we get

2.3. The rotator in this problem may be regarded as conﬁned to the (z = 0)-
plane and its position at time t may be denoted by the azimuthal angle ϕ. The conjugate variable pϕ is then mρ2ϕ˙ , where the various symbols have their usual meanings. The energy of rotation is given by

E

=

1 m(ρϕ˙ )2 2

=

p2ϕ

/

2mρ2.

Lines of constant energy in the (ϕ, pϕ)-plane are “straight lines, running parallel to the ϕ-axis from ϕ = 0 to ϕ = 2π”. The basic cell of area h in this plane is a “rectangle with sides ∆ϕ = 2π and ∆pϕ = h/2π”. Clearly, the eigenvalues of pϕ, starting with pϕ = 0, are n and those of E are n2 2/2I, where I = mρ2 and n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
The eigenvalues of E obtained here are precisely the ones given by quantum mechanics for the energy “associated with the z-component of the rotational motion”.
2.4. The rigid rotator is a model for a diatomic molecule whose internuclear distance r may be regarded as ﬁxed. The orientation of the molecule in
6

7

space may be denoted by the angles θ and ϕ, the conjugate variables being pθ = mr 2θ˙ and pϕ = mr 2 sin2 θϕ˙ . The energy of rotation is given by

E=

1 m(rθ˙)2 + 2

1 m(r sin
2

θϕ˙ )2 =

p2θ 2mr 2

+

p2ϕ 2mr 2 sin2 θ

=

M2 ,
2I

where I = mr 2 and M 2 = p2θ + p2ϕ/ sin2 θ .
The “volume” of the relevant region of the phase space is given by the integral dpθdpϕdθ dϕ, where the region of integration is constrained by the value of M . A little reﬂection shows that in the subspace of pθ and pϕ we are restricted by an elliptical boundary with semi-axes M and M sin θ, the enclosed area being πM 2 sin θ. The “volume” of the relevant region, therefore, is

π

2π

(πM 2 sin θ)dθ dϕ = 4π2M 2.

θ=0 ϕ=0

The number of microstates available to the rotator is then given by 4π2M 2/h2, which is precisely (M/ )2. At the same time, the number of microstates associated with the quantized value Mj2 = j(j + 1) 2 may be estimated as

1 j + = 2j + 1.

This is precisely the degeneracy arising from the eigenvalues that the azimuthal quantum number m has, viz. j, j − 1, . . . , −j + 1, −j.
2.6. In terms of the variables θ and L(= m 2θ), the state of the simple pendulum is given by, see eqns. (2.4.9),

θ = (A/ ) cos(ωt + ϕ), L = −m ωA sin(ωt + ϕ),

with E

=

1 2

mω2A2

and τ

= 2π/ω.

The trajectory in the (θ, L)-plane is

given by the equation

θ2

L2

(A/ )2 + (m ωA)2 = 1,

which is an ellipse — just like in Fig. 2.2. The enclosed area turns out to be πmωA2, which is precisely equal to the product Eτ .

2.7. Following the argument developed on page 68–69 of the text, the number of microstates for a given energy E turns out to be

1 Ω(E) = (R + N − 1)!/ R!(N − 1)!, R = E − N ω / ω. (1)
2

8

For R N , we obtain the asymptotic result Ω(E) ≈ RN−1 / (N − 1)!, where R ≈ E / ω.

(3.8.25a)

The corresponding expression for Γ(E; ∆) would be

(E / ω)N−1 ∆

E N −1 ∆

Γ(E; ∆) ≈ (N − 1)! · ω = (N − 1)!( ω)N .

Dividing (2) by (1), we see that the conversion factor ω0 is precisely hN .

Equating (1) and (2), we get: A = (8π)N /(3N )!, which yields the desired

result for V3N .

so that

Σ(n, V, E) = V N (8π E3 / h3 c3)N / (3N )!,

which is a function of N and VE 3. An isentropic process then implies that VE 3 = const.

The temperature of the system is given by

The equation for the isentropic process then becomes VT 3 = const., i.e. T ∝ V −1/3; this implies that γ = 4/3. The rest of the thermodynamics
follows straightforwardly. See also Problems 1.7 and 3.15.

3.4. For the ﬁrst part, we use eqn. (3.2.31) with all ωr = 1. We get

k ln Γ = k ln
N

which is indeed equal to −(A/T ) + (U/T ) = S. For the second part, we use eqn. (3.2.5), with the result that

3.5. Since the function A(N, V, T ) of a given thermodynamic system is an extensive quantity, we may write

A(N, V, T ) = Nf (v, T ) (v = V / N ).

It follows that

Adding these expressions, we obtain the desired result.

3.6. Let’s go to part (c) right away. Our problem here is to maximize the

expression S/k = − Pr,s ln Pr,s, subject to the constraints Pr,s =

r,s

r,s

10

11

1, EsPr,s = E and NrPr,s = N . Varying P ’s and using the method

r,s

r,s

of Lagrange’s undetermined multipliers, we are led to the condition

{−(1 + ln Pr,s) − γ − βEs − αNr} δPr,s = 0.
r,s
In view of the arbitrariness of the δP ’s in this expression, we require that

−(1 + ln Pr,s) − γ − βEs − αNr = 0 for all r and s. It follows that

Pr,s ∝ exp(−βEs − αNr).
The parameters α and β are to be determined by the given values of N¯ and E¯. In the absence of the constraint imposed by N¯ , the parameter α does not even ﬁgure in the calculation, and we obtain

Pr ∝ exp(−βEr),
as desired in part (b). And if the constraint imposed by E¯ is also absent, we obtain
Pr = const., as desired in part (a).

For the ideal gas, Q ∝ V N T 3N/2. Therefore, (∂ ln Q/∂V )T = N/V . We then get
(N/V )2 CP − CV = −k −N/V 2 = Nk .

3.8. For an ideal gas,

It follows that T (∂ ln Q1/∂T )P = 5/2; the expression on the right-hand side of the given equation then is

h3

which, by eqn. (3.5.13), is indeed equal to the quantity S/Nk.

3.12. We start with eqn. (3.5.5), substitute H(q,p) = p2i /2m + U (q) and
i
integrate over the pi s, to get

1 2πmkT 3N/2

QN (V, T ) = N !

ZN (V, T ), where ZN (V, T ) =

Substituting these results into the above expression for S, we obtain the

For the second part of the question, we write U (q) = u(rij ), so that
i<j

e−βU(q) = e−βu(rij ) = (1 + fij ) ,

i<j

and follow Problems 3.23 and 1.4. The quantity V¯ then appears to be in the nature of a “free volume” for the molecules of the system.

The ﬁrst term is (2/3)(N/V ) times the kinetic energy per particle so is O(N ). The second term is (1/3)(N/V ) times the virial per particle so is also O(N ). On the other hand, third term is proportional to the force on the walls divided by the volume so is O(N 2/3) which is negligible in the thermodynamic limit.

This means that

∂U − HU + H2 = 0, ∂β

which amounts to the desired result: H2 − H 2 = −(∂U/∂β).

For a ﬁnite V and ﬁnite E, the quantity G is bounded ; therefore, in the limit τ → ∞, the right-hand side of (1) vanishes. The left-hand side then gives

i
which leads to the desired result.

3.20. The virial of the noninteracting system, by eqn. (3.7.12), is −3PV . The contribution from interparticle interactions, by eqn. (3.7.15), is given by the “expectation value of the sum of the quantity −r(∂u/∂r) over all pairs of particles in the system”. If u(r) is a homogeneous function (of degree n) of the particle coordinates, this contribution will be −nU , where U is

16

the mean potential energy (not the internal energy) of the system. The total virial is then given by

V = −3PV − nU .

The relation K

still holds, and the rest of the results follow

straightforwardly.

The next problem pertains to n = 4.

3.22. Note that a force proportional to q3 implies a potential energy proportional to q4. Thus

It follows that

H = 1 p2 + cq4 2m

(c > 0).

where I(β) denotes the integral in the denominator. It is straightforward to see that I(β) is proportional to β−1/4, whence cq4 = 1/4β, which
proves the desired result.

3.23. The key to this derivation is writing the partition function in terms of
position integrals over scaled coordinates. Assume a cubic box of size L and volume V = L3. The scaled position for particle i is si = ri/L. The

partition function is 1

This can be simpliﬁed by going back to integrals over the normal position variables to give equation (3.7.15).

3.24. By eqn. (3.7.5), we have, for a single particle,

3

piq˙i = 3kT .

(1)

i=1

The left-hand side of (1) is the expectation value of the quantity p · u, i.e. pu which, for a relativistic particle, is equal to m0u2(1 − u2/c2)−1/2. The desired result follows readily.

In the non-relativistic limit (u

c), one obtains:

1 2

m0

u2

≈

3 2

kT

;

in

the

extreme relativistic limit (u → c), one obtains: mc2 ≈ 3kT . Note that,

in the latter case, m0c2 is negligible in comparison with mc2, so there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the kinetic energy and the total energy

of the particle.

3.25. For the ﬁrst part of this problem, see Sec. 6.4 — especially the derivation of the formula (6.4.9). For the second part, equate the result obtained in the ﬁrst part with the one stated in eqn. (3.7.5).

3.26. The multiplicity w(j){= (j + s − 1)!/j!(s − 1)!} arises from the variety

of ways in which j indistinguishable quanta can be divided among the

s dimensions of the oscillator: j = j1 + . . . + js; this is similar to the calculation done on page 68–69 of the text.

As for the partition function, QN(s)(β) =

Calculation of the various thermodynamic quantities is now straightforward. The results are found to be essentially the same as for a system of sN one-dimensional oscillators. However, since

Q(Ns) (β) = Q(N1s) (β),

the chemical potential µs will turn out to be s times µ1.

3.28.

(a) When one of the oscillators is in the quantum state n, the energy left

for the remaining (N − 1) oscillators is E −

n

+

1 2

ω; the corre-

sponding number of quanta to be distributed among these oscillators

is R−n; see eqn. (3.8.24). The relevant number of microstates is then

given by the expression (R − n + N − 2)!/(R − n)!(N − 2)!. Combined

with expression (3.8.25), this gives

(R − n + N − 2)! (R + N − 1)!

pn = (R − n)!(N − 2)! ÷

. R!(N − 1)!

(1)

It follows that

pn+1 =

pn R − n + N − 2

By iteration, pn = p0{n¯/(n¯ + 1)}n. Going back to eqn. (1), we note that

3.31. This problem is essentially the same as Problem 3.32, with g1 = g2 = 1, ε1 = 0 and ε2 = ε.

3.32. We use formula (3.3.13), with Pr = p1/g1 for each of the states in group 1 and p2/g2 for each of the states in group 2. We get

S = −k g1

(a) In thermal equilibrium,

pi =

With x = β(ε2 − ε1), we have: p1 = g1/(g1 + g2e−x) and p2 = g2/(g1ex + g2). Substituting these results into (1), we obtain

Writing the ﬁrst log as ln g1 + ln{1 + (g2/g1)e−x} and the second log as ln g1 + x + ln{1 + (g2/g1)e−x}, we obtain the stated expression for S.
(b) With Q = g1e−βε1 + g2e−βε2 , it is straightforward to see that

A = −kT ln{g1e−βε1 + g2e−βε2 } and U = {g1ε1e−βε1 + g2ε2e−βε2 }/{g1e−βε1 + g2e−βε2 }.

The formula S = (U − A)/T then leads to the desired result.

21

(c) As T → 0, x → ∞ and S indeed tends to the value k ln g1. This corresponds to the fact that the probabilities p1 and p2 in this limit tend to the values 1 and 0, respectively.

At high temperatures, the exponential may be approximated by (1 + βgµBmH ) which yields, to the leading order in H,

µ¯z = βg2 µ2BHm2.

One readily obtains for the Curie constant (per unit volume) of the system

CJ = N0 g2 µ2B / k m2.

Writing m = J cos θ, one obtains the desired result. For the second part, we simply note that, for a given J,

cf. eqn. (3.9.5). It is clear that this approximation will lead essentially to the same results as the ones following from the Langevin theory — except for the fact that the role of µ will be played by gµBJ, which should be contrasted with the expression (3.9.16) of the quantum theory.

(b) The Curie law implies that M = CH /T . This means that (∂H/∂T )M = H/T , while (∂M/∂T )H = −CH /T 2. It follows that CH − CM = CH 2/T 2.

3.42. Let N1(N2) be the number of dipoles aligned parallel (opposite) to the ﬁeld. Then N1 + N2 = N, while − N1ε + N2ε = E.

which agrees with eqn. (3.10.8).

3.43. The partition function of this system is given by the usual expression (3.5.5), except for the fact that the Hamiltonian of the system is now a function of the quantities pj + (ej / c)A(rj), and not of the pj as such. However, on integration over any √component of pj, from −∞ to +∞, we obtain the same standard factor 2πmkT — regardless of the value of the corresponding component of A. The partition function is, therefore, independent of the applied ﬁeld and hence the net magnetization of the system is zero.

3.44. The Shannon information for a single message is given by I1 = − r Pr ln Pr where Pr is the a priori probability of message r from among all Ω possible messages. The maximum information is obtained from varying the
probabilities, using a Lagrange multiplier µ to maintain the normalization
r Pr = 1, and demanding the solution is stationary.

0 = δI1 − µδ

Pr = − δPr [ln pr − 1 − µ].

r

r

This implies the Pr = const, i.e. all messages are equally likely. Therefore Pr = 1/Ω , which gives I1 = ln Ω. Any other set of probabilities gives smaller information per message.
Keeping to the general cases in which probabilities of individual messages messages do not need to be equal, consider a sequence of two messages. The a priori probability of message r followed by message r is Prr = PrPr Grr . The quantity Grr is the correlation between the two messages. A value of Grr greater than unit implies that the ﬁrst message r increases the probability of ﬁnding the second message r above Pr . The two message probabilities have the following properties: r Prr = Pr and r Prr = Pr, i.e. r PrGrr = 1 and r Pr Grr = 1. The information contained in two messages is given by

I2 = Prr ln Prr = PrPr Grr ln (PrPr Grr ).

rr

rr

Expanding the logarithm and using the above summation properties gives

1

I2 = 2I1 − PrPr Grr ln Grr = 2I1 + PrPr Grr ln

rr

rr

Grr

.

25
Now, using ln x ≤ x − 1 for all x > 0, we get
I2 ≤ 2I1 + PrPr [1 − Grr ] = 2I1.
rr
The information contained in two correlated messages is reduced compared to sum of the information contained in two uncorrelated messages. Analysis of the ﬁrst 65536 digits of π results in an information per character of I1 ≈ 2.3 = ln 10. That makes sense because the characters 0, · · · , 9 are evenly distributed in the digital representation of π. Furthermore, since the digits of π are uncorrelated, the information per pair of characters is I2 ≈ 4.6 = 2I1. Analysis of the ﬁrst 15, 000 characters of A Chrismas Carol by Charles Dickens gives I1 ≈ 3.08 ≈ ln 21.75. This value is reasonable since most of the characters are lower case letters of the alphabet and blanks. The nonuniformity of the distribution of letters reduces the information below ln 27 . When analyzed two characters at a time, the information is I2 ≈ 5.45 ≈ 2 ln 15.25. The strong correlations between characters in English text reduces the information well below 2I1.

Pr,s ln Pr,s ≡ ln Pr,s = −αN¯ − βE¯ − βPV

Since µN¯ = G = U + PV − TS , the right-hand side of (1) equals −S/k. Hence the result.

4.2. According to the grand canonical ensemble theory,

PV = kT ln

Nr

Now, the largest term in the sum pertains to the value N ∗, of Nr, which is determined by the condition

∂ ∂Nr {Nr ln z − ln QNr }Nr=N∗ = 0.

By Sec. 3.3, this is equivalent to the statement: z = exp(µ∗/kT ), where

µ∗ is the chemical potential of the given system in a canonical ensemble

(with N = N ∗). If we replace the sum in (1) by its largest term, we

would get

PV ≈ N ∗µ∗ − A∗ = P ∗V,

where P ∗ is the pressure of the system in the canonical ensemble (with N = N ∗). How diﬀerent would P be from P ∗ depends essentially on how diﬀerent the particle density n¯ is from n∗ — a question thoroughly
discussed in Sec. 4.5.

4.3. The probability distribution in question is the binomial distribution

P (N, V ) =

N (0)!

pN qN (0)−N

N !(N (0) − N )!

p = V (0) , q = 1 − V (0) .

26

27

We note that

N (0)
P (N, V ) = (q + p)N(0) = 1.
N =0

For part (i), we have

N (0)

N¯ =

N P (N, V ) = N (0)p(q + p)N(0)−1 = N (0)p, while

N =0

N (0)
N (N − 1) = N (N − 1)P (N, V ) = N (0)(N (0) − 1)p2(q + p)N (0)−2 = N (0)(N (0) − 1)p2.

N =0

It follows that

N 2 =N (N − 1) + N¯ = (N (0)p)2 − N (0)p2 + N (0)p, whence (∆N )2 ≡ N 2 − N¯ 2 = N (0)p(1 − p), etc.

For part (ii), we shift the origin to N = N (0)p, write N = N (0)p + x, N (0) − N = N (0)q − x

and examine the function ln P (x) = ln N (0)!−ln(N (0)p+x)!−ln(N (0)q−x)!+(N (0)p+x) ln p+(N (0)q−x) ln q.

Since N (0)p and N (0)q are both 1, we apply Stirling’s formula, ln v ! ≈ v ln v − v, and get (after some reduction)

ln P (x) ≈ −(N (0)p + x) ln 1 + x − (N (0)q − x) ln 1 − x .

N (0)p

N (0)q

For x N (0)p and N (0)q, we expand this expression in powers of x, with the result that ln P (x) ≈ −x2/2N (0)pq. It follows that the distribution P (x), under the stated conditions, is a Gaussian, with (∆N )2 = N (0)pq.
For part (iii), we write

P (N ) = N (0)(N (0) − 1) . . . (N (0) − N + 1) pN (1 − p)N(0)−N . N!

Now, if p 1 and N N (0), we obtain the Poisson distribution

P (N ) ≈ [N (0)]N pN e−N(0)p = (N¯ )N e−N¯ ,

with (∆N )2 = N¯ .

which is a Poisson distribution, with (∆N )2 = N¯ .
We note that the variance of N , calculated from the general formula (4.5.3), also turns out to be the same:

[a = a(T )].

(1)

Using Stirling’s formula (B.29), we get

ln QN ≈ N0 ln N0 − N ln N − (N0 − N ) ln(N0 − N ) + N ln a,

with the result that

µ = −kT ∂ ln QN = kT ln N .

(2)

∂N

Alternatively, the grand partition function of the system consisting of all N0 sites (of which some are empty while others are occupied by a single molecule) is given by

Q(z, N0, T ) = [Q(z, 1, T )]N0 = [1 + za(T )]N0 ;

(3)

see eqn. (4.4.15), with Nr = 0 or 1. Note that expression (3) could also be
N0
obtained by using the standard deﬁnition Q(z, N0, T ) = zN QN (N0, T )
N =0
and employing expression (1) for QN . The mean value of N now turns

Now, if the molecules in the adsorbed phase are in equilibrium with those

in the gaseous phase, then their fugacity z would be equal to the fugacity

whereby

(∆J )2 = (∆E)2 − 2µ(∆E)(∆N ) + µ2(∆N )2.

4.14. The Clausius–Clapeyron equation (4.7.7) can be integrated to give

L1 1

Pσ(T ) = Pσ(T0) exp k

− T0 T

,

where T0 = 373 K, Pσ(T0) = 1 atm and

L

(2260 kJ/kg)(18 kg/kmol)

k = (6.02 × 1026 kmol−1)(1.38 × 10−23 J/K) = 4890 K.

31
This gives Pσ(273 K) 0.0082 atm and Pσ(473 K) 16 atm. The experimental values are 0.006 atm and 15.3 atm respectively.

4.15. The correct value for the latent heat of sublimation near the triple point is 2833 kJ/kg. Following the solution to problem 4.14,

L1 1

Pσ(T ) = Pσ(T0) exp k

− T0 T

,

where T0 = 273 K, Pσ(T0) = 612 Pa and

L

(2833 kJ/kg)(18 kg/kmol)

k = (6.02 × 1026 kmol−1)(1.38 × 10−23 J/K) = 6138 K.

This gives Pσ(193 K) 0.055 Pa which corresponds nearly exactly with the experimental value.

4.16. The slope of the melting line is

dPm = Lm dT T (∆v)

(80 cal/g)(4.18 J/cal)(106 cm3/m3) (273 K)(−0.09 cm3/g)

This gives Tm(100 atm) = −0.77◦C.

4.17. The slopes at the triple point are of the form

−1.3 × 107 Pa/K.

so the vectors

[(v1 − v2)xˆ + (s1 − s2)yˆ] + [(v2 − v3)xˆ + (s2 − s3)yˆ] + [(v3 − v1)xˆ + (s3 − s1)yˆ] = 0

sum to zero. This makes the third vector the negative of the sum of the ﬁrst two vectors in each case, guaranteeing the stated geometry.

4.18. The liquid–vapor lines will appear much like in ﬁgure 6.2 but the liquid branch will extend to P = 0. The upper end of the solid–liquid lines will appear as in ﬁgure 6.2 but the lines will end at Ps.

The liquid side of solid–liquid lines will start at Pt and extend upward as in ﬁgure 6.2 but the solid side of the solid–liquid transition will be to the right of the liquid line (since the solid has lower density) and will extend to P = 0.

5.4. If we use the unsymmetrized wave function (5.4.3), rather than the symmetrized wave function (5.5.7), the density matrix of the system turns out to be, cf. eqn. (5.5.11),

(2)

where λ is the mean thermal wavelength of the particles. The structure of expressions (1) and (2) shows that there is no spatial correlation among the particles of this system.

with no Gibbs’ correction factor.

ε

Substituting for pε(n) from eqn. (6.3.10) into (3) leads to the desired result (2), with a = −1; substituting from eqn. (6.3.11) instead leads to the desired result (2), with a = +1.

6.2. In the B.E. case, see eqn. (6.3.10),

pε(n) = (1 − r)rn [r = nε /( nε + 1); n = 0, 1, 2, . . .].

It follows that

nε = (1 − r) nr n = r/(1 − r),

n2ε = (1 − r) n2rn = r(1 + r)/(1 − r)2, so that

In the F.D. case, see eqn. (6.3.11),

n2ε = n2pε(n) = pε(1) = nε , so that

n2ε − nε 2 = nε − nε 2

Comparing (4) with our previous results (1)–(3), and with formula (6.3.9),

we infer that, quite generally,

n2ε − nε 2 = kT [∂ nε /∂µ]T .

6.4. To determine the state of equilibrium of the given system, we minimize its free energy, U − TS , under the constraint that the total number of particles, N , is ﬁxed. For this, we vary the particle distribution from n(r) to n(r) + δn(r) and require that the resulting variation

e2 δ(U − TS ) =

n(r)δn(r ) + n(r )δn(r)

|r − r |

drdr + e δn(r)ϕext (r)dr

+ kT [1 + ln n(r)]δn(r)dr = 0,

while δN = δn(r)dr is, of necessity, zero. Introducing the Lagrange multiplier λ, our requirement takes the form

e2

n(r )

dr |r − r |

+ eϕext (r) + kT [1 + ln

n(r)] − λ

δn(r)dr = 0.

Since the variation δn(r) in this expression is arbitrary, the condition for equilibrium turns out to be

e2

n(r ) |r − r| dr + eϕext (r) + kT ln n(r) − µ = 0,

(1)

where µ = λ − kT . Introducing the total potential ϕ(r), viz.

n(r)

ϕ(r) = ϕext (r) + e

dr , |r − r |

(2)

condition (1) takes the Boltzmannian form

n(r) = exp[{µ − eϕ(r)}/kT ].

(3)

Choosing n(r) to be n0 at the point where ϕ(r) = 0, eqn. (3) may be written as

n(r) = n0 exp[−eϕ(r)/kT ].

(4)

With ϕext (r) given, the coupled equations (2) and (4) together determine the desired functions n(r) and ϕ(r).

6.5. The (un-normalized) distribution function for the variable ε in this prob-

For the Maxwellian distribution,

The

contribution comes from the potential energy of the system, which also

rises with T . Note, from eqns. (1) and (2), that the eﬀective height of the

gas molecules is (1 − e−βmgL)/βmg which for small heights is essentially

L itself but for large heights is essentially kT/mg — making the total

potential energy of the gas equal to NkT.

Since the 238UF6 molecules are heaver, their concentration is enhanced at r = R, while the concentration of the 235UF6 is enhanced near r = 0. The

A value of ωR = 500 m/s gives a 16% enhancement compared to the input fraction. Drawing the uranium hexaﬂuoride gas from near the center of the cylinder results in a sample that is isotopically enhanced with 235U compared to the input concentration. This process may be repeated as often as needed to achieve the isotopic fraction needed.

6.10. Consider a layer of the gas conﬁned between heights z and z + dz . For hydrostatic equilibrium, we must have

P (z + dz ) + ρgdz = P (z),

where ρ is the mass density of the gas. In diﬀerential form, one gets

dP /dz = −ρg = (−mg/kT )P.

(1)

(a) If T is uniform, eqn. (1) can be readily integrated, with the result

ln P = −(mg/kT )z + const.,

(2)

which yields the desired formula: P (z) = P (0) exp(−mgz /kT ).

(b) If, on the other hand, the equilibrium is attained adiabatically, then T is related to P ; in fact, T ∝ P (γ−1)/γ. We now get

dT γ − 1 dP γ − 1 mg

This means that T now decreases essentially linearly with height.
The pressure P and the density ρ go hand in hand with T — varying as T γ/γ−1 and T 1/γ−1, respectively.

6.11. (a) For the given system,

f (p)dp = const .e−βε(p)(4πp2dp) = C e−βc(p2+m20c2)1/2 p2dp.

The normalization constant C is determined by the condition

f (p)dp = C e−βc(p2+m20c2)1/2 p2 dp = 1.

(b) Using the limiting forms

K2(x) ≈ 2/x2

we obtain, rather straightforwardly, the nonrelativistic and the extreme relativistic limits of the distribution.

Once again, integrating by parts (this time twice), we obtain

Substituting for C, we obtain: pu = 3/β — regardless of the severity of the relativistic eﬀects and in conformity with the results of Secs. 3.7 and 6.4.

6.12. Ordinarily, when a molecule is reﬂected from a stationary wall that is
perpendicular to the z-direction, the z-component of its velocity u simply
changes sign, i.e. uz = −uz. If the wall is receding at velocity v in the direction of its normal, the above result changes to (uz − v) = −(uz − v), so that uz = −(uz − 2v). This results in a change in the translational energy of the molecule which, for small v, is given by

where Ek is the total kinetic energy of the gas. Note that, since the gas continues to be in a state of (quasi-static) equilibrium, the change δE (even

though it originates in the translational motion of the molecules) becomes

eventually a change in the internal energy U of the gas (which may well

have contributions from degrees of freedom other than translational). If

U = aE k, we may write

Re-arranging (3) and integrating it, we obtain the desired result.

In the extreme relativistic case, the factor 2/3 is replaced throughout by 1/3, leading to the alternate value of γ.

each.

It

follows that the mean energy ε of an eﬀused molecule is 2 kT.

(b) Assuming quasi-static equilibrium, the relations E = (3/2)NkT and P = NkT /V will continue to hold for the gas inside the vessel. However, in view of the result obtained in part (a), we shall also have

It follows that

6.15. If nH is the number of holes per unit area of the surface of the balloon (of radius r), a the area of each hole and t the duration of the leak, then the total number of molecules leaking is given by

Substituting the data given, we obtain: nH 187 holes/m2.

In the stationary state, these two expressions will be equal — which leads to the condition of dynamic equilibrium

If the two gases are samples of the same gas, the condition simpliﬁes to

PA/PB = (TA/TB)1/2.

We deﬁne the relative velocity, v, and the velocity of the centre-of-mass, V, in the usual manner, viz.

This results in a new distribution for the variables v and V:

√ It is now straightforward to show that v = (16/πβm)1/2 = 2√u , while v2 = (6/βm) = 2 u2 . The latter result implies that vr.m.s. = 2 ur.m.s..

We note that, since

v2 = u21 + u22 + u22 − 2u1 · u2,
v2 = 2 u2 , regardless of the law of distribution of velocities — so long as it is isotropic, making u1 · u2 = 0.
6.19. The (un-normalized) joint distribution for the molecular energies ε1 and ε2 is

f (ε1, ε2)dε1dε2 ∼ e−β(ε1+ε2) ε11/2ε12/2dε1dε2.
To obtain the desired distribution, we set ε2 = E − ε1 and integrate over all relevant values of ε1, with the result that
E

6.20. The relative fraction of the excited atoms in the given sample of the helium gas would be 3e−βε1 , where

6.21. We extend the treatment of Problem 3.14 to the reaction AB + CD ↔ AD + CB and obtain, in equilibrium,

K(T ) = fH2 D , fHH fDD

where each f is a product of three factors — the translational, the rotational and the vibrational.

6.23. The potential V (r) is minimum at r = r0, which determines the equilib-

rium value of r. Accordingly, the quantum of the rotational motion of

the molecule is 2/2I, where I = µr02. This gives for Θr the expression

2/2µr02k =

because

gives a fairly clear idea of the “temperature range” where the rotational

48

motion of the hydrogen molecules begins to contribute towards the speciﬁc heat of the gas.
Next we expand V (r) in the neighborhood of r = r0 and write

V (r) = −V0 + (V0/a2)(r − r0)2 + . . . .

This gives an ω equal to (2 V0/µa2)1/2 = (4V0/ma2)1/2 and hence a Θv equal to (4V0/ma2)1/2/k. Substituting the given data, Θv turns out to be about 6260 K. Again, this gives a fairly clear idea of the “temperature
range” where the vibrational motion of the hydrogen molecules begins to
contribute towards the speciﬁc heat of the gas.

Using data from the preceding problem, we ﬁnd that for a hydrogen molecule the fractional change in r0 is O(10−3).

6.25. The occupation number NJ is proportional to (2J + 1) e−εJ /kT . It fol-

N0 : N1 : N2 :: 0.050 : 0.208 : 0.742.

6.29. The various contributions to the molar speciﬁc heat of the gas at 300 K are: (i) translational — the amount being (3/2)R.

49

(ii) rotational — since the characteristic values of the parameter Θr in this case are of the order of 10 K, these degrees of freedom may be treated classically, which yields a contribution of (3/2)R; see eqn. (6.5.42).
(iii) vibrational — here, the parameters Θv are such that the various contributions have to be calculated quantum-mechanically, using formula (6.5.44). We ﬁnd that

Θ1,2 16.00, Θ3,4 4.56, Θ5 16.37, Θ6 7.80,

with the result that only modes 3 and 4 make appreciable contributions to the speciﬁc heat of the gas; it turns out that each of these contributions is about 0.22R. The contribution from mode 6 is about 0.02R, while those from modes 1,2 and 5 are entirely negligible.
The net result is: 3.46R.

where n is the particle density. To invert this series, we write

z = c1(nλ3) + c2(nλ3)2 + c3(nλ3)3 + c4(nλ3)4 + . . .

(2)

and substitute into (1). Equating coeﬃcients of like powers of (nλ3) on the two sides of the resulting equation, we get

For T Tc, which implies z 1, we recover the classical result: γ = 5/3. As T → Tc, z → 1 and the function g1/2(z) diverges as α−1/2; see eqn. (D.8). Along with it, both γ and CP diverge as (T − Tc)−1; see the
relation established in Problem 7.3.

where n = N/V . For N0 N, n(T, z) = aT 3/2g3/2(z), where a is a constant; see eqn. (7.1.8). It follows that

and

κS

g3/2(z) . g5/2(z)

Since c = ak , the desired results follow readily. Note that, as z → 1, κT diverges in the same manner as γ and CP . (b) Since P = 2U/3V, (∂P/∂T )V = 2CV/3V . It follows that

in agreement with eqn. (7.1.48a). The other result follows straightforwardly.

7.6. For T > Tc, we employ expression (7.1.37) and write

1 ∂CV

∂ =

Nk ∂T V ∂ ln z Nk

The ﬁrst factor turns out to be

.

The second factor is given by eqn. (7.1.36). Multiplying the two, we obtain the desired result.
For T < Tc, we employ expression (7.1.31) instead. Since CV is now proportional to T 3/2,

1 ∂CV = 3 CV , Nk ∂T V 2T Nk

55

which leads to the result quoted in the problem.

As T → Tc from above, the quantity under study approaches the limiting

We also note, see eqns. (7.1.37) and (7.1.48b), that

It is now straightforward to see that the stated thermodynamic relations are indeed satisﬁed. The critical behavior of these quantities is also straightforward to check.

7.8. One readily sees that

w2 = ∂P

∂(nm) S mnκS

56

where κS is the adiabatic compressibility of the ﬂuid. Using a result from Problem 7.5, we get for the ideal Bose gas

w2 = 5kT g5/2(z) . 3m g3/2(z)

Next,

u2 = 2ε = 2 U = 3kT g5/2(z) ;

m

mN

m g3/2(z)

see eqns. (7.1.8) and (7.1.11). Clearly, w2 = (5/9) < u2 >.

7.9. We start by calculating the expectation values of the quantities ε1/2 and ε−1/2:

∞

nε ε1/2a(ε)dε

ε1/2 = 0 ∞

,

nε a(ε)dε

0

ε−1/2

∞

nε ε−1/2a(ε)dε

.

nε a(ε)dε

0

The integral in the denominator has been evaluated in Section 7.1; those in the numerator can be evaluated like-wise, with the results

ε1/2 = (kT )1/2 Γ(2)g2(z) , ε−1/2 = (kT )−1/2 Γ(1)g1(z) .

Γ(3/2)g3/2(z)

Γ(3/2)g3/2(z)

It follows that

u = 2 ε1/2 = 8kT g2(z) , while

m

πm g3/2(z)

u−1 = m ε−1/2 = 2m g1(z) .

2

πkT g3/2(z)

Multiplying the last two expressions, we obtain the desired result.
For z → 0, we recover the classical result stated in Problem 6.6. For z → 1, we encounter divergence of the quantity u−1 , which arises from the contribution made by the particles in the condensate (for which u = 0).

7.11. Under the conditions of this problem, the summation in eqn. (7.1.2) has to be carried out over the states of the internal spectrum as well as over the translational states. Expression (7.1.16) is then replaced by

V

Ne = (Ne)0 + (Ne)1 = λ3 g3/2 exp kT

The critical temperature Tc is then determined by the condition

V λ3c g3/2(x) = N,

where x = e−ε1/kT c .

(1)

57

For x 1, g3/2(x) x and eqn. (1) gives

λ3c (V /N )[ζ(3/2) + x]. Comparing this with the standard result λ0c 3 = (V /N )ζ(3/2), we get

7.12. The relative mean-square ﬂuctuation in N is given by the general for-

mula (4.5.7),

(∆N )2 kT

N¯ 2 = V κT ,

(1)

while κT for the ideal Bose gas is given in Problem 7.5. As T → Tc from above, the function g1/2(z) and, along with it, both κT and the relative ﬂuctuation in N diverge!

The mean-square ﬂuctuation in E is given by the general formula (4.5.14),

viz.

(∆E)2 = kT 2CV + {(∂U/∂N )T,V}2(∆N )2.

(2)

The ﬁrst term in (2), for the ideal Bose gas, is determined by eqn. (7.1.37) and stays ﬁnite at all T. The second term can be evaluated with the help of eqns. (7.1.8 and 11), whereby

∂U

= ∂g5/2(z)

= g3/2(z) .

(3)

∂N T,V

∂g3/2(z) T,V g3/2(z)

The second term in (2) is, therefore, inversely proportional to g1/2(z) and hence vanishes as T → Tc; this happens because the energy associated with the Bose condensate (which is, in fact, the component responsible for the dramatic rise in the ﬂuctuation of N ) is zero. Thus, all in all, the relative ﬂuctuation in E is negligible at all T.

7.13. It is straightforward to see that for a Bose gas in two dimensions

Since Bose-Einstein condensation requires that z → 1, the critical tem-

perature Tc, by the usual argument, is given by

N A

λ2c = g1(1) = ∞

[for g1(z) = − ln(1 − z)].

It follows that Tc = 0.

More accurately, the phenomenon of condensation requires that both Ne

and N0 be of order N . This means that, while z 1, (1 − z) be of order N −1 and hence λ2 be of order (A ln N /N ). Since the ratio (A/N ) ∼

follows that

Next, following the derivation of eqn. (7.1.11), we get

U = kT 2 ∂ PV

n = PV ,

(4)

∂T kT z,v s

so that P = sU /nV .

The onset of Bose-Einstein condensation requires that z → 1 at a ﬁnite

temperature Tc. A glance at eqn. (2) tells us that this will happen only

if n > s and that the critical temperature Tc will then be determined by the equation

For T < Tc, Ne will be equal to N (T /Tc)n/s while N0 will be given by the balance (N − Ne).

This gives the spatial distribution for one cartesian direction once you note that /ma2 = ω0. At long-time, the width of the distribution grows linearly in time.

The high-temperature limit of equation (7.2.15) is given by the ﬁrst term in the series since at high temperature the chemical potential is large and negative.

7.17. The ground state density at the center of the trap is N0/(π3/2a3); see problem 7.15. Using N0/N = 1−(T /Tc)3, a = /(mω), and kTc/( ω) = (N/ζ(3)1/3), we get

n(0)λ3 = 7ζ(3)1/2N 1/2 1.

7.22. Since ω = 2πc/λ, the characteristic frequencies of the vibrational modes of a radiation cavity (and hence the energy eigenvalues of these modes) are proportional to L−1, i.e. to V −1/3. Just as in Problem 1.7, we infer that the entropy of this system is a function of the combination (V 1/3U ). It then follows that during an isentropic process the quantity (V 1/3U ) stays constant, i.e. 1 V −2/3dV U + V 1/3dU = 0. 3

which is indeed equal to the zero-point energy of the solid.
The physical interpretation of this result lies in noting that the actual amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a solid is less than the value predicted classically because the solid already possesses a ﬁnite amount of energy even at T = 0K.

7.26. Using the Debye spectrum (7.4.15), we have for the zero-point energy of

7.27. We’ll show that if the entropy of a system is given by S = aVT n, where a
is a constant, then the quantity (CP − CV) of that system is proportional to T 2n+1. For the Debye solid, at T ΘD, this indeed is the case, the parameter n being equal to 3. Hence the stated result.

The mode density, g(ω), is given by the relation

g(ω)dω = 3 · V (4πp2dp)/h3,

where p = k = (A−1ω)1/s. It follows that

g(ω)dω = Cω(3/s)−1)dω [C = 3V /(2sπ2A3/s)].

(2)

Substituting (2) into (1) and introducing the variable x = ω/kT , we get

CV(T ) ∼ T 3/s

x0 x(3/s)+1ex 0 (ex − 1)2 dx

x0 =

.

At low temperatures, the upper limit of this integral may be replaced by inﬁnity — making the integral essentially T -independent; this leads to the desired result CV ∼ T 3/s.
7.34. The mode density in this case is given by, see eqn. (C.7b),
g(ω)dω ∼ kn−1dk ∼ ωn−1dω.

The rest of the argument is similar to the one made in the previous problem; the net result is that the speciﬁc heat of the given system, at low temperatures, is proportional to T n.
It is not diﬃcult to see that if the dispersion relation were ω ∼ ks and the dimensionality of the system were n, then the low-temperature speciﬁc heat of the system would be proportional to T n/s.

7.35. The Hamiltonian of this system is given by eqn. (7.4.6); the partition function then turns out to be, see eqn. (3.8.14),

As explained in Section 7.6, though rotons obey Bose-Einstein statistics, their distribution function is practically Boltzmannian; see eqns. (7.6.6 and 7). We may, therefore, write

V A(v) = −kT · h3

Integrating over θ, we get

Integration over p is now carried out the same way as in eqn. (7.6.9); with appropriate approximation, we end up with the result

A(v) = A(0) sinh(βvp0)/(βvp0).

in agreement with eqn. (7.5.15). Unfortunately, in the case of rotons this expression presents certain problems of analyticity at the point p = p0; we then resort to direct calculation — leading to eqn. (7.6.19), whereby (meﬀ )rot p20/3kT .

It follows that, at temperatures much less than εF /k,
CV = 2Nk (kT /εF ),
which is “correct” insofar as the dependence on T is concerned but is numerically less than the true value, given by eqn. (8.1.39), by a factor of 4/π2.
The reason for the numerical discrepancy lies in the fact that the present approximation takes into account only a fraction of the particles that are thermally excited; see Fig. 8.11. In fact, the ones that are not taken into account have a higher ∆ε than the ones that are, which explains why the magnitude of the discrepancy is so large.

8.6. This problem is similar to Problem 7.8 of the Bose gas and can be done the same way. In the limit z → ∞, which corresponds to T → 0K,
w2 ≈ 2kT ln z/3m,

which tends to the limiting value 2εF /3m. Thus w0 = (2εF /3m)1/2.

For comp√arison, the Fermi velocity uF = (2εF /m)1/2. It follows that w0 = uF / 3.

For lead, ne = 4, na = 4, a = 4.95 ˚A, while m = 2.1 me — giving εF = 9.45 eV and TF = 10.96 × 104 K. For aluminum, ne = 3, na = 4, a = 4.05 ˚A, while m = 1.6 me — giving εF = 11.63 eV and TF = 13.50 × 104 K.

(ii) The nuclear radius for 80Hg200 is about 8.4 × 10−13 cm. Taking all the nucleons together, this gives a particle density of about 8.06 × 1037 cm−3. Substituting this into eqn. (8.1.34), we get: εF = 3.7 × 107 eV and TF = 4.3 × 1011 K.
(iii) For liquid He3, the particle density is about 1.59 × 1022 cm−3. This yields an εF of about 4.1 × 10−4 eV and a TF of about 4.8 K.

which can be done quite easily; see eqns. (7)–(9) of the solution to Problem 7.14. For part (iv), we observe that, since the quantity S/N is a function of z only, an isentropic process implies that z = const. Accordingly, for such a process,
VT n/s = const . and P/T (n/s)+1 = const .;

see eqns. (2) and (3) of the solution to Problem 7.14. Eliminating T among these relations, we obtain the desired equation of an adiabat. For part (v), we proceed as follows.
In this limit z → 0, eqn. (1) gives

74

Letting T → 0, we recognize that the constant appearing in the above
result must be equal to EF (N, 0). To verify this, we note that, since the Fermi momentum of the gas in two dimensions is given by the equation N = A · πp2F /h2, the Fermi energy is given by εF = p2F /2m = Nh2/2πmA. The ground-state energy of the gas then follows readily:

which leads to the desired result for µ.

Next, substituting (4) into (3), we obtain the remarkably simple expression

8.14. In the notation of Sec. 3.9, the potential energy of a magnetic dipole in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld B = (0 , 0 , B) is given by the expression
−(gµBm)B, where m = −J, . . . , +J. The total energy ε of the dipole is then given by ε = (p2/2m ) − gµBmB , m being the (eﬀective) mass of the particle; the momentum of the particle may then be written as

p = {2m (ε + gµBmB )}1/2.

At T = 0, the number of such particles in the gas will be

The corresponding result in the limit T → ∞ is given by

8.15. We note that the symbol µ0(xN ) denotes the chemical potential (≡ kT ln z) of an ideal gas of xN “spinless” (g = 1) fermions. The corresponding fugacity z is determined by the equation

f3/2(z) = xN λ3/V.

Diﬀerentiating (1) with respect to x, we get

We observe that eqn. (3) can also be written as

E0 + P0V = Nmc2(cosh θF − 1) = N εF ≡ N µ0.

To verify that the derivative (∂E0/∂V )N is equal to −P0, we have to show that
[∂{VB (x)}/∂V ](Vx3) = −A(x), i.e. ∂{x−3B(x)}/∂x−3 = −A(x), i.e. x4 ∂ [8{(x2 + 1)1/2 − 1} − x−3A(x)] = 3A(x), i.e.
∂x ∂A(x)/∂x = 8x4(x2 + 1)−1/2,

which can be readily veriﬁed with the help of expression (8.5.13).

9.3. The average kinetic energy per relativistic electron/positron is of the order
of ue/ne ∼ kT . The Coulomb energy per electron/positron is of the order of uc ≈ e2/(4π 0a) where a ≈ (1/ne)1/3 is of the order of the average distance between the charged particles. Using ne ∼ (kT / c)3 we get uc/ue ∼ e2/(4π 0 c) ≈ 1/137. This is the justiﬁcation for treating the
relativistic electrons and positrons as noninteracting.

9.6. Correction to the ﬁrst printing of third edition: the energy density in the statement of the problem should read
utotal = (1 + (21/8)(4/11)4/3)uγ .
After the electron–positron annihilation, the only relativistic species left are the photons and the neutrinos. The factor 21/8 = (3)(1)(7/8) in the energy is because there are three families of neutrinos, the spin degeneracy factor is 1 (all left handed), and 7/8 is the Fermi-Dirac factor. The factor (4/11)4/3 is due to the lower temperature of the neutrinos compared to the photons; see equation (9.6.4). Following the solution to problem 9.1, we get

9.7. If the current CMB temperature was 27K rather than 2.7K, the baryonto-photon ratio would be 103 times smaller. Equation (9.7.8) implies that the nucleosynthesis temperature would have been about 20% lower which would have delayed the nucleosynthesis by an extra two minutes. This would have given the neutrons a longer time to decay leading to q ≈ 0.10 rather than 0.12, leading to a helium content in the universe of about 20%

81

by weight. If the current CMB temperature were 0.27K, that would have increased the baryon-to-photon ratio by a factor of 103. Fewer photons per baryon would have led to an earlier nucleosynthesis, less time for neutrons to decay and an increase of the neutron fraction to q ≈ 0.135 leading to about 27% helium content.

9.8. The strong interaction exhibits asymptotic freedom at high energies justifying treating the quarks an gluons as noninteracting. The eﬀective number of species in equilibrium in these tiny quark–gluon plasmas is accounted for using only the up and down quarks and the gluons. Photons, and leptons, for example, easily escape without interacting with the plasma.

Therefore at kT = 300 MeV (T 3.5 × 1012 K), the age of the universe was about 4 × 10−6 s.

With n = 6, expression (2a) reduces to the one derived in the preceding problem. Furthermore, if terms with j > 1 are neglected, we recover the van der Waals approximation (10.3.8).
For further comparison, we look at the behavior of the coeﬃcient B2(≡ a2λ3) at high temperatures. While the hard-core expression (2a) predicts a constant B2 as T → ∞, the soft-core expression (2) predicts a B2 that ultimately vanishes, as T −3/m, which agrees qualitatively with the data shown in Fig. 10.2.

10.3. (a) Using the thermodynamic relation

CP − CV = T (∂P/∂T )V(∂V /∂T )P = −T (∂P/∂T )2V/(∂P/∂V )T

and the equation of state (10.3.9), we get

CP − CV Nk

− T (∂P/∂T )2v k(∂ P /∂ v)T

=

T {k/(v − b)}2 − k{−kT /(v − b2) + 2a/v3}

=

1 1 − 2a(v − b)2/kT v3 .

(b) In view of the thermodynamic relation

TdS = CVdT + T (∂P/∂T )VdV

and the equation of state (10.3.9), an adiabatic process is characterized by the fact that
CVdT + NkT (v − b)−1dv = 0.

Integrating this result, under the assumption that CV = const., we
get T CV/Nk (v − b) = const .

Now integrating from state 1 to state 2, we readily obtain the desired result.

10.4. Since, by deﬁnition,

α = v−1(∂v/∂T )P and B−1 ≡ κT = −v−1(∂v/∂P )T ,

we must have:

[∂(αv)/∂P ]T = −[∂(vB−1)/∂T ]P .

Combining (2) and (3), we get

1 + u0 kT 0

For T < T0, (∂T /∂P )H > 0, which means that the Joule-Thomson expansion causes a cooling of the gas. For T > T0, (∂T /∂P )H < 0; the expansion now causes a heating instead.

Comparing this with eqn. (10.6.18), we obtain the desired result.
10.11. A particle with spin J can be in any one of the (2J + 1) spin states characterized by the spin functions χm(m = −J, . . . , J). For a pair of such particles, we will have (2J + 1)2 spin states characterized by the symmetrized spin functions

χm1 (1)χm2 (2) ± χm1 (2)χm2 (1) (m1,2 = −J, . . . , J ).
Of these, (2J + 1) functions, for which m1 = m2, can only be symmetric, for the corresponding antisymmetric combinations vanish identically. The remaining 2J(2J + 1) functions, for which m1 = m2, can be symmetric or antisymmetric; however, only half of them are linearly independent functions (because an interchange of the suﬃces m1 and m2 does not produce anything new). Thus, in all, we have J(2J + 1) antisymmetric spin functions, and (J + 1)(2J + 1) symmetric spin functions, that are linearly independent.

89

Now the total wave function of the pair will be the product of a symmetrized space function (like the ones considered in the previous problem) and a symmetrized spin function (like the ones discussed above). For the total wave function to be symmetric, as required for a pair of bosons, we may associate any of the (J + 1)(2J + 1) symmetric spin functions with a symmetric space function or any of the J(2J + 1) antisymmetric spin functions with an antisymmetric space function. This will lead to the quoted expression for the coeﬃcient bs2. On the other hand, for the total wave function to be antisymmetric, as required for a pair of fermions, we may associate any of the J(2J + 1) antisymmetric spin functions with a symmetric space function or any of the (J + 1)(2J + 1) symmetric spin functions with an antisymmetric space function. This will lead to the quoted expression for the coeﬃcient bA2 .
10.12. To derive the desired results, we make the following observations:
(i) Since a pair of particles with spin J has (2J + 1)2 possible spin states while a pair of spinless particles has only one, we have to divide the expression for b2 pertaining to the former by (2J + 1)2 so that we are talking of the average contribution per state.
(ii) To make a transition from discreteness in orientation (that is associated with a ﬁnite value of J) to continuity in orientation, we should take the limit J → ∞.
(iii) In view of the foregoing, the distinction between the original system being symmetric or antisymmetric is completely lost, and we are led to the results quoted in the problem.

Next, using eqns. (10.5.28, 36 and 37), we obtain for the quantum-mechanical Boltzmannian gas

Note every term includes the factor e−βu(r12). The coeﬃcients of those terms are integrals over the Mayer functions that are continuous functions of r12 even for the inﬁnite step function potential; see equation (10.3.19) and discussion in Hansen and McDonald (1986) Chapter 5.

10.15 Let P (r) be the cumulative probability that no particles are closer than r to a given particle. Breaking up the interval between zero and r into small intervals starting ar rk = k∆r with width ∆r gives

r/∆r

P (r) =

1 − 4πng(rk)rk2∆r ,

since each factor represents the probability there are no neighbors in interval k. This gives

An arbitrary constant c has been introduced here to secure “proper behavior” at r = ∞. Since exp(−βu) → 1 as r → ∞, we choose c = −1. The integrated part then vanishes [assuming that u(r) → 0 faster than 1/r3], and we are left with the result

10.21 The most general Gaussian distribution of variables {u1, · · · , uN } is of the form

P (u1, · · · , uN ) ∼ exp

where A is a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix. The matrix has only positive eigenvalues and can be diagonalized into diagonal matrix (A˜ = U T = U −1 using the orthogonal the matrix U . The eigenvalues {λ1, · · · , λN }
are all positive and detU = 1. The normalization is

N = dN u exp − 1 uT Au = dN y exp − 1 yT A˜y

The transformed variables are y = U T u so the Jacobian is unity. The integral of the average of exp aT u can be determined from completing
the square inside the exponential,

dN u exp aT u − 1 uT Au = N exp 1 aT A−1a .

Averaging the quantity aT u 2 is accomplished by transforming to the y variables which, using

dx x2 exp(−λx2/2) = (2π)1/2/λ3/2,

gives dN u aT u 2 exp − 1 uT Au = N aT U A˜−1U T a = N aT A−1a. 2

The later gets the ﬁrst two orders exactly correct, and the third and fourth order coeﬃcients correct to better that 1%.

nˆp

=

a+p ap

=

1 1 + αp2

b+p bp − αp b−pbp + b+p b+−p + αp2 b−pb+−p

.

The terms linear in αp do not contribute to the expectation value of nˆp
(with p = 0) because of the absence of the diagonal matrix elements in b−pbp and b+p b+−p. Further, since b+p bp = Nˆp and b−pb+−p = Nˆ−p +1, we get

1 np = 1 − αp2

N¯p + αp2(N¯−p + 1)

(p = 0).

Finally, in view of the isotropy of the problem, N −p = N p and we get the desired result.
