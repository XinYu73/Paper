Abstract

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays an important role in water splitting to produce hydrogen. The high price of precious platinum-based catalysts that are the best HER electrocatalysts by now hampers the commercial application. Low-cost, earth-abundant and highly-efficient HER electrocatalysts are thus long-desired. On the basis of first-principles calculations, we investigated the HER electrocatalytic performance of the non-precious TiF 3 and its analogs. Our calculations showed that TiF 3 and WO 3 can serve as efficient HER electrocatalysts with the overpotentials comparable to those of the platinum-based catalysts. To uncover the origins of electrocatalytic performance, we established a relationship between the surface adsorption ability of a material and its electronic structure. The low HER overpotentials, unique porous structure and high abundance in earth make these materials promising candidates for high-performance HER electrocatalysts.

1. Introduction

Increasing environmental issues and depletion of fossil fuels have posed urgent demands on clean and renewable energy sources [ 1 ]. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which is a fundamental process in electrocatalysis plays an important role in energy conversion through water splitting to produce hydrogen [ 2 ]. An ideal HER electrocatalyst should have zero overpotential. But the realistic electrocatalytic materials always have a nonzero overpotential that is needed to overcome the initial reaction energy barrier. Therefore, it's vital to design the catalysts with a low overpotential and fast kinetics for the efficient HER [ 3 ]. By far, noble metal Pt and Pt-group metals were adopted as the most reactive HER electrocatalysts [ 4 , 5 ]. However, the low abundance and high cost limit their widespread utilization. Development of low-cost, earth-abundant, high-efficient electrocatalysts to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts is highly demanding and has become the frontier of catalysis research.

A variety of non-noble metal catalyst systems have recently brought up and emerged as promising candidates for new-generation electrocatalysts. These materials include transition metal chalcogenides MX 2 (M: Mo, W, Fe; X: S, Se) [ [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] ], metal carbides [ 11 ], metal nitrides [ 12 ], metal phosphide [ 13 ], metal oxide [ 14 ], Mxene [ 15 ], metal-free material (carbon material and C 3 N 4 ) [ [16] , [17] , [18] ] and metal materials (Ni, Co, etc.) [ 19 ]. However, the HER efficiency of the electrocatalysts remains lower than the noble metal electrocatalysts. Additionally, some of the HER catalysts face the problem of irreversible recovery due to structure deformation as more active sites are introduced, e.g. by forming porous structures on surfaces [ 20 ].

In this work, we proposed a new family of HER electrocatalytic materials: TiF 3 and its analogs with intrinsic large voids in its cubic crystal [ 21 ]. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated that the under-coordinated metal atoms on the surfaces exhibit excellent HER catalytic performance. The predicted overpotentials of these non-noble metal catalysts are comparable to those of the Pt-based catalysts. We also developed a description for the relationship between bond strength and electronic structure. We hope that this work can unlock the potential of earth-abundant materials as highly-efficient HER electrocatalysts and offer vital guidance for the design of novel HER electrocatalysts.
2. Method and computational details

Our first-principles calculations were performed within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), which is implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package known as VASP [ 22 ]. The electron–ion interactions were described by projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potentials [ 23 ]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [ 24 ] in the form of Perdew–Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) [ 25 ] was adopted for the exchange–correlation functional. The plane waves employed to expand the Kohn–Sham electron wavefunction have an energy cutoff of 520 eV. Structural optimizations were carried out using a conjugate gradient (CG) method without any symmetry constrains until the maximum force on each atom was less than 0.01 eV Å −1 . In the electronic band structure calculations , we employed the hybrid functional proposed by Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE06) [ 26 ]. In the HSE06 functional, the PBE exchange term is splitted into a short-range and a long-range part, and 25% of the short-range part is then replaced by a short-range Hartree-Fock term. The Brillouin zone (BZ) integration was sampled on a grid of 11 × 11 × 11 k -points for the unit cells of bulk crystals [ 27 ]. The long-range van der Waals interactions were taken into account by using the DFT-D2 method [ 28 ]. For the nanosheets , a 2 × 2 slab repeated periodically along the x- and y- directions was employed and a vacuum space up to 20 Å was applied along the z- direction to avoid interaction between neighboring images. A 5 × 5 × 1 k -point grid for structural optimizations, a 9 × 9 × 1 k -point grid for static computation, and a 21 × 21 × 1 k -point grid for the density of states (DOS) calculations were employed in the Brillouin zone integration [ 27 ]. The slab model contains three atomic layers with two symmetric terminals. The top two layers were fully relaxed during structural optimizations, while other layers were fixed at the lattice positions of bulk crystals. Spin-polarization was considered in the whole calculations. The kinetic barrier and transition state for H desorption and H 2 formation were simulated by using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CNEB) method as implemented in the VASP transition state tools [ 29 , 30 ]. The intermediate images were relaxed until the forces were less than 0.02 eV/Å.

As for the HER in an acid electrolyte (pH = 0), H + can act as the proton donor, the overall reaction scheme can be written as: (1) H + + e − + ∗ ⇌ 1 / 2 H 2 ∗ ⇌ 1 / 2 H 2 g + ∗

The symbol * represents the catalysts and H* is the H adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts. The free energies of the studied systems can be obtained by using the following equation: ΔG = ΔE + ΔZPE - TΔS, where ΔE, ΔZPE, ΔS are the binding energy, zero-point energy change and entropy difference. ΔZPE is the zero-point energy difference between the adsorbed state of the system and the gas-phase state. The reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) model developed by Nørskov and co-workers was used to obtain the Gibbs reaction free energy of these electrochemical elementary steps [ 31 , 32 ]. In this model, we set up RHE as the reference electrode where the proton-electron pair corresponds to half a hydrogen molecule: μ H + + μ e -  = 1/2 μ H2 , at conditions of U = 0 V and P H2  = 1 bar.

The chemical potential of each adsorbate is defined as: μ = E + E ZPE - T × S, where E is the total energy obtained from DFT calculations, E ZPE is zero-point energy correction calculated from vibrational frequencies , and S is the entropy at 298 K taken from the standard tables.

The reaction free energy (ΔG H⁎ ) and the theoretical overpotential (η) of HER are determined by using the following equations:

ΔG H∗  =  μ H ∗  − 0.5 ×  μ H 2  −  μ ∗

η = − ∣ ΔG H ∗ ∣ / e

For the calculations of the band center of the anti-bonding state projected onto the d orbitals of transition metal atom and s orbitals of the H atom ( E anti-bond ), the following expression was used [ 33 ]: E anti − bond = ∫ E f + ∞ E × ρ d E + ρ s E dE ∫ E f + ∞ ρ d E + ρ s E dE .
3. Results and discussion

The crystal structures of TiF 3 and its analogs (WO 3 , ScF 3 , ReO 3 , NbF 3 , TaF 3 , and MoF 3 ) have a cubic cell belonging to a space group of pm 3 ¯ m. Metal ions locate at the corners of the cube linked by anions. Each metal ion is coordinated by six anions, and each anion is bonded to two metal ions. The optimized lattice constants range from 3.795 Å to 4.112 Å, as listed in Table 1 . Such a line-centered cubic lattice leads to intrinsic large voids, offering abundant active sites and channels for hydrogen diffusion. Notably, the TiF 3 material and its analogs have been synthesized more than half a century ago [ [34] , [35] , [36] , [37] , [38] , [39] , [40] , [41] ]. Very recently, their utilizations in hydrogen storage and photocatalysis were reported [ 42 , 43 ]. TiO 2 /TiF 3 hybrids exhibit excellent visible-light photocatalytic reactivity in the photodegradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation, which was attributed to the high concentration of Ti 3+ species provided by TiF 3 [ 42 ]. TiF 3 can also act as an efficient catalyst to facilitate hydrogen and dehydrogenation in a variety of reversible hydrogen storage materials , such as MgH 2 and NaAlH 4 [ 43 ]. Although the associated mechanism remains under debate, the interaction between TiF 3 and hydrogen is expected to play an important role in the catalytic processes. However, the electrocatalytic HER performance of TiF 3 in water splitting to produce hydrogen has never been reported to date.

These materials exhibit diverse electronic properties. TiF 3 crystal has a spin-polarized ground state with remarkable spin-splitting of about 1.4 eV, as shown in Fig. S1(b). Each Ti ion owns ~1 μB magnetic moments. Half-metallicity is quite evident in the band structure of TiF 3 crystal. The Fermi level crosses the bands of one spin channel, leading to abundant electronic states at the Fermi level, whereas a large band gap of about 8.00 eV appears in the opposite spin channel. The bands in the proximity of the Fermi level are rather dispersive in the momentum space, suggesting good conductivity of the conducting spin channel. The origin of the electron spin-polarization has been reported in our previous work [ 44 ]. Electron spin-polarization has also been found in the electronic band structures of NbF 3 , TaF 3 and MoF 3 crystals. Similar to the case of TiF 3 , NbF 3 and TaF 3 are half-metals and each metal ion owns ~2 μB magnetic moments. MoF 3 is a spin-polarized semiconductor where each Mo ion carries ~3 μB magnetic moments. No spin-polarization was found in ScF 3 , WO 3 , and ReO 3 crystals. The electronic structures of these materials are summarized in Fig. S1.

In these line-centered cubic lattices, the (001) surfaces have the lowest density of dangling bonds and thus are more accessible in experiments. The energetic preferability of the (001) surfaces was also been confirmed by the surface energy calculations, as seen in Table S1. In the work, we choose the (001) surface of these materials to investigate the ability of hydrogen adsorption. A slab model of a 2 × 2 nanosheet terminated by two (001) planes was adopted, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The slab lattice parameters were fixed to the optimized cell parameters of bulk crystals, to mimic the support bulk. For simplification, the nanosheets contain only three atomic layers with the atoms on the lowest layer been fixed to mimic bulk effect. We also checked the convergence of this model by employing a thicker model contains more atomic layers and got the same conclusion, as shown in Fig. S2.

Now we take the TiF 3 nanosheet as a representative model to describe the adsorption of hydrogen on the (001) plane of these materials. The possible adsorption sites include the center of a square (H site), the top of a Ti atom (T1 site) or an F atom (T2 site), and the top of a Tisingle bond F bond (B site), as shown in Fig. 1 (a). It is found that the H atom can stably adsorb on these sites expect the B site. The H atom placed at the B site moves to the T1 site during structural relaxation.

We defined the binding energy (E b ) of a H atom on the TiF 3 nanosheet as E b = E H + TiF 3 − E TiF 3 − E H , where E H + TiF 3 , E TiF 3 represent the total energies of TiF 3 nanosheets with and without H adsorption, E H is the energy of an isolated H atom. The E b values calculated from our calculations are −2.514 eV (for the T1 site), −1.871 eV (for the T2 site) and 0.485 eV (for the H site), respectively. The T1 site (top of Ti) is the energetically most preferable for H adsorption. Generally, an obvious electron-accepting region is commonly found around the H atom, representing a significant electron transfer from TiF 3 to H, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). This is also consistent with the larger electronegativity of H than that of Ti. The amounts of electron transfer were quantitatively evaluated by performing Bader charge analysis [ 45 ]. About 0.46 electrons transfer from the TiF 3 nanosheets to the adsorbed H atom.

Generally, the overall HER pathway can be described by a three-state diagram comprising an initial state H + + e − , an intermediate adsorbed H*, and a final product 1/2H 2 ( Fig. 2 a) [ 33 , [46] , [47] ]. The Gibbs free-energy of the intermediate state, |ΔG H⁎ |, was regarded as a major descriptor of the HER activity. A smaller |ΔG H⁎ | means high catalytic activity. The optimal value of |ΔG H⁎ | is zero. The well-known highly efficient Pt catalyst has |ΔG H⁎ | ≈ 0.09 eV [ 46 ] ( Fig. 2 a). We also calculated the |ΔG H⁎ | of the (111) surface of Pt crystal using the above-mentioned strategy and found that it is about 0.12 eV. Notably, the HER overpotentials (η) of Pt-based electrocatalysts measured in experiments are highly dependent on the composition of the catalysts, which are −0.16 V for Pt/Ni 3 N nanosheets [ 48 ], –0.05 V for Pt-Ni/C octahedral [ 49 ], –0.052 V for Pt/C [ 50 ],–0.022 V for Pt-Ni-Co [ 50 ], –0.032 V for Pt/Ni(OH) 2 [ 51 ], and −0.01 V for Pt/Fe-NF [ 52 ]. Our calculations showed that the ΔG H⁎ of TiF 3 is only −0.03 eV for the T 1 site, which is comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts. The HER free-energy diagrams of TiF 3 and its analogs are plotted in Fig. 2 (a). TiF 3 has two types of action sites, T1 and T2. The ΔG H⁎ of T2 site is about −0.55 eV. Notably, WO 3 and ReO 3 also exhibit high HER catalytic performance with the overpotentials of only −0.05 V and −0.22 V. However, ReO 3 is not only as expensive as Pt but also a compound of acute toxicity , and thus unsuitable for water splitting to produce hydrogen in practical applications.

(b) Free-energy diagram of HER on the surface of TiF 3 under different H* coverage (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0) conditions. Blue, argent, green spheres indicate the Ti, F and H atoms, respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

We then investigated the HER free-energy diagrams of TiF 3 , WO 3 and ReO 3 under different H* coverage levels (θ). We considered four levels of H* coverage with θ =0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0, corresponding to adsorbing 1, 2, 3 and 4 hydrogen atoms on a 2 × 2 supercell. The free-energy diagrams under different H* coverage are plotted in Figs. 2 (b) and S3. The ΔG H⁎ of TiF 3 increases to 0.05, 0.17 and 0.24 eV at θ = 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0, respectively. We can see that the HER performance of TiF 3 is comparable to the Pt-catalysts as the H* coverage is lower than ~50%. For ReO 3 , high HER catalytic performance is maintained at different H* coverage, as indicated by the stable ΔG H⁎ around −0.22 eV. For WO 3 , The ΔG H⁎ of TiF 3 increases to 0.04, 0.17 and 0.26 eV at θ = 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0, it is noteworthy that the HER free energies of WO 3 and TiF 3 exhibit uniform trend with the increase of H* coverage. The stability of the ΔG H⁎ values is crucial for maintaining high HER performance of the catalysts at different H* coverage levels.

The apparent activity of electrocatalyst materials can be improved through two strategies. One is climbing to the top of the volcano plot through optimizing ΔG H⁎ . The other is modifying the physiochemical properties of catalysts to increase the density of the exposed active sites for an identified sample. The first strategy can be achieved through the principle that the catalytic property of a catalyst is determined by its electronic structure [ 53 ]. A descriptor was always introduced to describe the relationship between ΔG H⁎ and electronic structure. Here, we established a descriptor based on the electron density of states (DOS) to show the relationship between ΔG H⁎ and electronic structure. We enumerated seven relationships, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, and found that the weighted center of total DOS without the adsorption of H below the Fermi level (DOS2) shows a better linear relation with ΔG H⁎ for the crystals considered in this work, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The closer the weighted center of total DOS is to the Fermi level, the stronger the H* adsorption strength will be. Considering the decisive role of d orbitals in the formation of H-M bonds, only the d-projected DOS of transition metal atom in the adsorption position is presented. The adsorption strength of hydrogen is connected to the center of the d-orbit of the underlying metal atom. As the center is closer to the Fermi level, stronger interaction between adsorbate and catalyst surface will be obtained.

Fig. 3 . (a) The relationship between ΔG H⁎ and the weighted center of projected d-orbital density of states of transition metal atom without hydrogen adsorption. Only the occupied states are taken into accounted. (b) The center of the anti-bonding states projected on the d orbitals of transition metal atom and s orbitals of the H atom. (c) The spin-resolved electron density of the e g states projected onto the Ti on the surface of TiF 3 . (d) Energy level diagram of orbital hybridization of active sites and hydrogen adsorbate. E F is the Fermi level of the substrate; σ ∗ and σ indicate bonding and anti-bonding states, respectively.

The relationship between the surface adsorption ability of a material and its electronic structure can be explained in terms of bond formation. When a proton from the electrolyte combines with an electron from the electrode on the catalyst surface to form a H*, the electronic states of the active transition metal interacts with those of hydrogen, and consequently their hybridized energy levels split into two: anti-bonding states ( σ ∗ ) that is normally above the Fermi level and the bonding states (σ) under the Fermi level. The adsorption strength of H on the catalyst surface can be tuned by the position of the anti-bonding states, that is, the closer the anti-bonding states to the Fermi level, the weaker the interaction between catalyst surface and hydrogen and vice versa, as elucidated in Fig. 3 (b). The occupation of anti-bonding states weakens the adsorption of the H on the catalyst surface.

The surface reconstruction of these catalysts also affects their interaction with H. TiF 3 and its analogs undergo a z-in Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion, forming a compressed octahedral structure. Therefore, the electron wavefunction overlap between the catalyst surface and H atom mainly is more remarkable along the z-direction than other directions. This is consistent with the partial spin-resolved electron density of the e g states of the transition metal atom, ( Figs. 3 (c), S5) which shows that the contributions of the d z2 orbit are closer to the Fermi level than those of the d x2-y2 orbit. The energy and wavefunctions of these d z2 states facilitate the strong interaction with H, i.e., the closer the center of d z2 orbit to the Fermi level, the stronger interaction between adsorbate and catalyst surface will be obtained (Fig. S4(g)).

Finally, we discussed the catalytic performance of TiF 3 and its analogs. We found that H 2 O prefers to absorb on the top of Ti (T1 site) on the surface with the binding energy of 0.67 eV. The decomposition from H 3 O + to H + and H 2 O is barrierless, which is beneficial for the Volmer step. We evaluated the kinetic barriers for two adsorbed H* species on the active sites of TiF 3 , WO 3 and ReO 3 to form a H 2 molecule in the framework of the Tafel mechanism. In the initial state, the distances between the H atom and the active sites are 1.72 Å, 1.74 Å and 1.67 Å for TiF 3 , WO 3 and ReO 3 , respectively. The energy barriers between the initial states and the adsorbing states are determined to be 1.90 eV (TiF 3 ), 3.11 eV (WO 3 ) and 3.89 eV (ReO 3 ), respectively , as shown in Figs. 4 and S6. Notably, the energy barrier of TiF 3 is comparable to the values of freestanding carbon-based materials (~2 eV) [ 16 ], N-doped graphene on Fe substrate (1.93 eV) [ 54 ]. From a thermodynamic point of view, TiF 3 provides suitable binding strength for HER catalysis.
