Abstract

Neutron diffraction studies confirm that La 2 NiMnO 6 is ferromagnetic with moments on Ni and Mn indicating Ni II and Mn IV (small and large spheres, respectively, in Figure). Electrical resistivity measurements show semiconducting behavior with a room temperature conductivity of ∼10 2  Ω cm and very high resistivity at low temperature. On application of a magnetic field, significant changes in electrical resistivity and dielectric constant occur at temperatures as high as 280 K.
