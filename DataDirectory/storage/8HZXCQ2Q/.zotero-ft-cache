Thermodynamic equations of state (EOS) for crystalline solids describe material behaviors under changes in pressure, volume, entropy and temperature, making them fundamental to scientiﬁc research in a wide range of ﬁelds including geophysics, energy storage and development of novel materials. Despite over a century of theoretical development and experimental testing of energy–volume (E–V) EOS for solids, there is still a lack of consensus with regard to which equation is indeed optimal, as well as to what metric is most appropriate for making this judgment. In this study, several metrics were used to evaluate quality of ﬁt for 8 different EOS across 87 elements and over 100 compounds which appear in the literature. Our ﬁndings do not indicate a clear “best” EOS, but we identify three which consistently perform well relative to the rest of the set. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that for the aggregate data set, the RMSrD is not strongly correlated with the nature of the compound, e.g., whether it is a metal, insulator, or semiconductor, nor the bulk modulus for any of the EOS, indicating that a single equation can be used across a broad range of classes of materials.

INTRODUCTION
Thermodynamic equations of state (EOS) for crystalline solids describe material behaviors under changes in pressure, volume, entropy and temperature; making them fundamental to scientiﬁc research in a wide range of ﬁelds, including geophysics, energy storage and development of novel materials.1–3 Despite over a century of theoretical development and experimental testing of EOS for solids,4,5 there is still a lack of consensus on the most appropriate EOS under various conditions or even the metric to evaluate appropriateness. Previous attempts6,7 have focused on comparison with the experimental data, which limits the range of the accessible data. By contrast, computational studies can span chemical and structural space in a consistent and methodical manner, and are often able to probe extreme conditions beyond the range of current experimental techniques. Density-functional theory (DFT) is gaining grounds as a ﬁrst principles methodology that can accurately and efﬁciently search material space for complex functionality. In well-characterized systems, DFT calculations have been shown to be precise and reliable.8 In particular, Lajaeghere et al. recently benchmarked results for DFT-calculated thermodynamic properties of the elements, and found overall satisfactory agreement between prediction and experiment (excepting cases where magnetic, correlative, or relativistic effects are signiﬁcant; or in cases where van der Waals forces are dominant).9 While direct calculations of systems under pressure are possible in most DFT codes, the equations of state provide a simple mathematical handle with minimum computational cost. These considerations pave the way for high-throughput studies that probe extreme conditions using DFT generated EOS.
There are three key questions to answer in order to utilize highthroughput DFT-based EOS. Which EOS best encapsulates the fundamental physics presented by DFT and are there rules or

metrics that deﬁne EOS applicability? Are the optimal DFT-based EOS consistent with experimental values, and are therefore likely to reﬂect our physical reality? What are the limitations of these EOS?

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Equations of state The equations investigated in this study are described in detail below, and summarized in Table 1.

Birch (Euler and Lagrange)
Both forms of the Birch equation were derived by Francis Birch in 1947 for crystalline solids of cubic symmetry.10 The derivation was based on Francis Murnaghan’s extensive tensor formalism for analyzing ﬁnite strains.11 The ﬁrst Birch equation uses the Eulerian strain metric; the second form is based on the Lagrangian metric
(roughly the inverse of the Eulerian). As noted by both Birch and Murnaghan, the Eulerian metric is generally considered to be a more apt description of elastic behavior for non-inﬁnitesimal strains, since it treats the ﬁnal (rather than initial) coordinates as the independent variable. The energy–volume relation arising from the Eulerian viewpoint is:

The Jellium EOS,19 a third-order polynomial ﬁt to energies, has

historically shown a high quality of ﬁt when utilized with the DFT

data.8 The authors for this EOS motivate their equation (wÀ1h=i3ch is

essentially a polynomial expansion in powers of x 

) by

arguing that each power of x corresponds to a contribution to the

energy of a crystal structure as a function of its cell volume. However, it does not appear that these justiﬁcations are entirely physical. For example, the x2 term in the Jellium model is aimed to

represent the kinetic energy of an electron gas surrounding the

atoms in the crysta2l. However, if the total energy varies roughly in

proportion to

(as is the case with NaCl, for instance),

this coefﬁcient is almost certainly negative if one examines the

Taylor expansion of E as a function of x. Hence, as the Jellium EOS

may in some cases revert to a non-physical polynomial function,

we did not include it in this study.

The RMSrD values for the ﬁts of all EOS across the investigated material set are shown for the elements (Fig. 1) (see Supplementary Fig. S1 in SI for data on the compound set). Noble gases have been excluded from the elemental set due to drastic deviations from ideal behavior for solids: in the most extreme case, oscillations in the E–V curve of Kr lead to an RMSrD of 37%, orders of magnitude larger than the mean values in Fig. 2. Other studies have shown that it is necessary to incorporate the effects of van der Waals forces in the calculations to adequately capture the energy curve behavior of noble gases,21 however, these forces were not included in our simulations. There is an interesting periodic trend in the plot of Fig. 1, which indicates a correlation between error in EOS ﬁt and number of valence electrons for a given element. We conjecture that this is due to the inability of the simpliﬁed EOS models to capture the physics of systems with greater numbers of interacting bodies (the implicit assumption being that DFT is able to do so more accurately, although previous comparison to experimental data has demonstrated that this

Fig. 4 RMSrD values for theoretical EOS ﬁtted to DFT calculations of various polymorphs of Al2O3 method is likely still prone to some error.9) It is clear from this plot that the Lagrangian formulation of the Birch EOS (Eq. (5)) fares signiﬁcantly worse than the other EOS under consideration and for this reason, it has been removed from subsequent plots in order not to obscure other data. This property has been remarked by previous authors,6,10 however, we do not believe any physical interpretation has previously been offered. We therefore point out that in approximately harmonic systems, where the E–V curve is dominated by a quadratic strain term, the Eulerian metric more closely resembles the true E–V relation for most solids (Fig. 3). This observation might be taken into consideration for future theoretical work.
There is a large degree of variability in RMSrD from material to material, captured by the violin plot in Fig. 2 which displays the distribution for the combined set of elemental and compound materials. The average relative deviations are less than 1% regardless of material or theoretical equation used to ﬁt the E–V data for most materials investigated, which suggests that for general purposes of approximation, the particular choice of EOS is not crucial. Because the mean RMSrD values for some of the equations were quite close to each other, we also compared EOS performance on the basis of a few other error metrics: maximum

relative deviation (MrD), the greatest magnitude of fractional deviation for a given ﬁtted E–V curve from DFT-calculated points; statistical uncertainty for each of the ﬁt parameters (E0, V0, K, K′) as calculated from the least-squares. These analyses do not indicate a clearly superior EOS (see for example, Supplementary Fig. S2 in the SI), however, do suggest that the Birch (Eulerian), Tait, and Vinet equations tend to show lower deviation from calculated data points and less variability of ﬁtting parameters than the other equations investigated.
The RMSrD values did not exhibit strong correlation with the bulk modulus or the band gap in the elemental and compound sets (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 and Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4 in SI). This suggests that neither the metallic/ insulating nature nor softness of the material are predictive of error in the ﬁtted EOS. The effect of structure within a ﬁxed chemical system was also investigated for several materials, examples of which are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for various polymorphs of Al2O3 and Ga, respectively. Al2O3 shows essentially no variation of quality of ﬁt for any equation across a range of crystal systems. This is especially notable in light of the fact that both forms of the Birch equation were derived for media of cubic symmetry,10 with the rest assuming an isotropic medium. In contrast, Ga does exhibit noticeable variation in RMSrD between different polymorphs. Similar trends were observed for other chemical systems, with stiff metal oxides exhibiting low variability relative to softer metals (see Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 in SI). It is true that structures with different space groups may still have similar physical properties; this typically occurs when one structure is a slight distortion of another with higher symmetry. We examined the supergroup/subgroup relations of the given systems, and did not ﬁnd this to be the determining factor in the similarity or difference in error trends. For example, the only relation of this type in the alumina polymorph set (besides the trivial P1, which is a subgroup of every space group) is P21/c and C2/m (numbers 14 and 12, respectively); whereas for gallium, Cmce (number 64) is a subgroup of Cmcm (number 63) and I4/ mmm (number 139). These ﬁndings suggest that variations in structure are not necessarily predictive of variations in error for ﬁtted EOS.

experimentally observed behavior, we compared the values of the bulk modulus (K) derived from the EOS for each material with values found in the literature. All three equations yielded similar results as determined by the mean unsigned percent error between calculation and experiment, which was in every case about 18% for the elemental set and 12% for the compound set. Results are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 for the Vinet equation, which had the smallest overall average error (by less than one percent). Similar plots for the other two EOS are provided in Supplementary Figs. S8–S11 of SI. There is limited experimental data on secondorder elastic constants (used to calculate K′), but a few systems are compared in Fig. 8.
Agreement between experimental and calculated values of elemental and compound bulk moduli is good, with regression slope and R2 values for both sets very close to 1 (Fig. 6). Previous studies have indicated that zero-point energy can lead to greater discrepancy between 0 K calculations and experiment for lighter elements,22 however, the error in bulk modulus values was not correlated to atomic mass for the elemental data set in this study (see Supplementary Figure S7). A few elements show variation from experimental data of greater than 50 GPa, labeled on the ﬁgure. Of these, Cr, Np, and Pa have been studied elsewhere by

both experiment and calculation, and have shown similar systematic deviations as reported here. The discrepancy for Cr arises from magnetic ordering,23 which was not considered in this study. Previous experimental studies have shown that the bulk modulus of this element increases considerably at lower temperatures (nearly 20% from room temperature to 77 K).24 The variations for Np and Pa have been attributed to bonding in 5f orbitals.25,26 Previous studies using exact and overlapping mufﬁn tin orbitals have been able to reproduce experimental elastic properties of actinides, in particular plutonium.27 This all-electron DFT method, while effective, is computationally expensive and difﬁcult to generalize, making it unsuitable for EOS generation in high-throughput schemes.
Comparison to experimental values of K′ is more difﬁcult, since they are small dimensionless quantities (typically in the range of 1–10), and the combination of experimental uncertainties and inherent variability due to different methods of ﬁtting data lead to a wide range of cited literature values even for a single material. Figure 8 shows a few representative examples. Since the bulk modulus pressure derivative can be used to derive other material properties, such as behavior at ﬁnite temperatures,7 it is useful to have an internally consistent method for deriving K′ (although it

the validity of the pseudopotential approximation, extrapolation

of the EOS may in some cases give a more physically valid (and

computationally cheaper) prediction than simply performing

higher-pressure calculations.

Many of the materials exhibit phase transformations far below

the pressure range of the DFT curves, in which case the question is

no longer whether a single DFT-derived EOS is valid at high

pressures, but whether we can use DFT-based EOS of multiple

polymorphs to predict these transitions. This analysis calls for

simulations at ﬁnite temperatures, and has not been included in

the present study.

In summary, the energy–volume curves of over 200 elemental,

binary, and ternary crystalline solids were calculated using DFT,

and the resulting data were ﬁt to several theoretical EOS

commonly cited in the literature. Although the quality of ﬁt, as

measured by RMSrD, did not vary greatly across the investigated

set of equations, the Birch (Eulerian), Tait, and Vinet equations

were found to give the best overall quality of ﬁt to calculated

energy–volume curves as compared to the other equations under

examination. Band gap and bulk modulus were not found to be

useful indicators of EOS quality of ﬁt for the aggregate set of

materials, although we observed that quality of ﬁt does vary with

structure for polymorphs within certain chemical systems. Bulk

modulus values derived from the calculated EOS were bench-

marked against experimental data, and in general display good agreement.

should be noted that, since K′ is the highest-order ﬁt parameter for the EOS investigated here, it is subject to the largest statistical uncertainty; see Fig. 9e). In light of their demonstrated accuracy in predicting K values, we therefore propose that numericallyderived EOS are valid avenues for analyzing and predicting thermodynamic properties of solid crystalline materials.
Bulk moduli calculated from the EOS were also compared against bulk moduli calculated from the elastic tensor using the formation detailed in elastic tensor workﬂow for Materials Project.28 For the most part, values are identical, with some elements showing noticeably lower values from the elastic tensor workﬂow (Fig. 7). This is likely due to higher order terms the E–V curves, or asymmetries of the unit cell (e.g., in the cases of Tb and Dy). The discrepancy in carbon is due to the nature of the ground state structure, which is layered (graphite). This leads to a highly anisotropic elastic tensor, and the Voigt-Reuss-Hill averaging scheme is skewed by the low shear modulus of this structure.28 On the other hand, the shear modulus is not accounted for by the isotropic volumetric deformations employed in this study resulting in a far less signiﬁcant effect of the lack of inter-layer cohesive forces on the calculated bulk modulus.
Since many applications for thermodynamic EOS involve materials subjected to extreme pressures (e.g., in geophysical research,29) it is natural to inquire whether there are pressure limits beyond which the DFT-derived EOS are no longer valid. A rough measure of these limits is given by comparing the maximal value found in the literature for pressure exerted on a material to that reached by the DFT simulation. Our ﬁndings, listed in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6 in SI, indicate that in many cases (e.g., AgCl), the latter of these limits is greater than or equal to the former, so that no extrapolation of the EOS is necessary for comparison with experimental results. However, in some cases, extrapolation would still be necessary: for example, for BeO, a stiff ceramic material, the maximum calculated volumetric compression of 15.7% corresponds to a calculated pressure of 127.5 GPa, whereas pressures of up to 175 GPa have been achieved in laboratory settings30 (see Supplementary Table S5 in SI). Because computations are capable of pressurizing a material well beyond

METHODS The calculation of EOS is automated using self-documenting workﬂows compiled in the atomate31 code base that couples pymatgen32 for materials analysis, custodian33 for just-in-time debugging of DFT codes, and Fireworks34 for workﬂow management. The EOS workﬂow begins with a structure optimization and subsequently calculates the energy of isotropic deformations, including ionic relaxation with volumetric strain ranging from from −33 to 33% (−10 to 10% linear strain) of the optimized structure. Density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations were performed as necessary using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method35,36 as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP)37,38 within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) formulation of the exchange-correlation functional.39 A cutoff for the plane waves of 520 eV is used and a uniform k-point density of approximately 7,000 per reciprocal atom is employed. Convergence tests were performed for selected materials across a range of bulk modulus values, with KPPRA values between 1,000 and 11,000; plots are provided in the SI (Supplementary Figure S12). In addition, standard Materials Project Hubbard U corrections are used for a number of transition metal oxides,40 as documented and implemented in the pymatgen VASP input sets.32 We note that the computational and convergence parameters were chosen consistently with the settings used in the Materials Project41 to enable direct comparisons with the large set of available MP data.
