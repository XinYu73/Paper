In Section 2, we brieﬂy introduce the local decoherence models to be considered in the present work. In Sections 3, 4, and 5, we investigate the robustness of entanglement for special genuine three-qubit entangled states and random pure states under three typical noise channels, respectively. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 6.

2. Decoherence Models
We consider three paradigmatic types of local decoherence channels: amplitude damping, dephasing, and bit ﬂip. It is assumed that each qubit in multiqubit quantum systems is coupled to its own noisy environment, and the mutual interaction between qubits is neglected. The dynamics of each qubit in a threeparticle quantum system is governed by a master equation. From the master equation, one can obtain a completely positive trace-preserving map ε which describes the corresponding evolution:[16] ρi (t) = ε(t)ρi (0). The maps (or channels) can be described, in the Born–Markovian approximation, via its Kraus representation[16,21] as

First, the Kraus operators for amplitude damping process are

As a second type of noise, the dephasing channel describes the processes where there is loss of quantum coherence with probability p, but without any exchange of energy. The Kraus operators of dephasing process to a state with a decoherence degree p are represented as

E0 =

E1 =

Finally, the third type of environment to be dealt with here is bit ﬂip channel. The Kraus operators of bit ﬂip channel can be expressed as

Diﬀerent from the depolarizing channel, these three channels are not invariant under the action of local unitary operations.

3. Robustness of Entanglement under Amplitude Damping Channel
3.1. Robustness of Special States under Amplitude Damping Channel

On the one hand, in order to pick up the bipartition entanglement dynamics, we use negativity N(ρ)[20] as the measure of entangle-
ment corresponding to the partitions 1:2 for three-qubit states.
Negativity is widely used in investigating the entanglement dy-
namics of multiqubit system, though it cannot detect positive par-
tial transpose (PPT) entangled states. The concept of negativity, ﬁrst introduced by Z˙ yczkowski et al.,[23] originates from the the well-known Peres–Horodecki criterion.[24] The entanglement of
qubit A with qubit B and C, is deﬁned as twice the absolute value
of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix ρTA describing the bipartition A − (B, C), which can be written in terms of the trace norm ρTA 1, as refs. [20,22]

N(ρ) = ρTA 1 − 1

(5)

On the other hand, we use concurrence[25] and three-tangle[26] as bipartite and tripartite entanglement criterion to detect the two kinds of entanglement properties for a given three-qubit pure state in the absence of decoherence, respectively. As the detector for two-tangle in a two-qubit state ρ, the concurrence is deﬁned as

C(ρ) = max{0, λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4}

(6)

where λ1 λ2 λ3 λ4 are the square roots of the eigenvalues

of the matrix ρ(σy ⊗ σy )ρ∗(σy ⊗ σy ). Here ρ∗ is the complex con-

jugation of the matrix ρ and σy is the second Pauli matrix. As

the

where

d3 = a000a110a101a011 + a111a001a010a100

(8)

The amplitude damping channel is a simpliﬁed model of spontaneous decay of a two-level atomic excitation state. We ﬁrst consider the system ABC be in a pure state

the pure state | . As the entanglement properties of threequbit states always aﬀect their robustness under depolarizing channel,[18,19] the entanglement dynamics of this genuine entangled three-qubit state without three-tangle under the amplitude damping channel is worth investigating.
Under the action of the amplitude damping channel (2), the partial transposed density matrix of the state (9) is given by

and s ≡ 1 − p. It is obvious that the exponent of parameter s is not more than 2 in all the matrix elements of Equation (11), which implies that the density matrix of the state (9) is so robust as to be less aﬀected by the amplitude damping noise.
Substituting the partial transposed density matrix (10) into Equation (5), the entanglement during the evolution can be easily obtained

We plot the degree of amplitude damping p when the entanglement decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16 in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively.

2 sin θ cos θ , CBC = sin2 θ , and the three-tangle τABC = 0 for this state, which indicate that the state | also contains the same amount of entanglement as the state | therein. But we will show that the entanglement dynamics of the state | is diﬀerent from that of state | under the same amplitude damping channel. The details are given in Appendix A.1.

In order to study the robustness of three-qubit states systematically, we explored the decoherence process of all three-qubit pure states under amplitude damping channel. On the one hand, according to Equation (13), one can easily get the relation between the degree of amplitude damping p and the initial entanglement N0 when the entanglement decreases to N0/2 (c=2), N0/4 (c=4), N0/8 (c=8), and N0/16 (c=16) for the robust state | in (9).
We plot these four curves with red solid lines in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 1, respectively. On the other hand, according to Equation (A.4) in Appendix A.1, one can easily get the relation between the degree of amplitude damping p and the initial entanglement N0 when the entanglement decreases to N0/2 (c=2), N0/4 (c=4), N0/8 (c=8), and N0/16 (c=16) for the fragile state | in (14). We also plot these four curves with green dashed lines in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 1, respectively. In order to study the robustness of arbitrary three-qubit pure state, we sampled 40 000 three-qubit pure states randomly distributed

according to the Haar measure[27] and calculated their negativity. This random matrix method is powerful and reliable to explore the robustness of an arbitrary three-qubit pure state in the absence of analytical method. For each sampled three-qubit pure state under amplitude damping channel, we compute the degree of amplitude damping p when its negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16 respectively. The degree of amplitude damping p is plotted in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 1 with black solid dots when the negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16, respectively.
From each inset in the ﬁgure, one can see that there is no oneto-one correspondence between the degree of amplitude damping p, measure the robustness of the random sampled states, and the initial entanglement N0. Moreover, it is obvious that the degree of amplitude damping p is not higher than the red lines and not lower than the green solid line when the negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16, respectively. In other words, the state | in (9) is the most robust one and the state | in (14) is the most fragile one during decoherence under amplitude damping channel, although both of them contain the same entanglement properties.

4. Robustness of Entanglement under Dephasing Channel
4.1. Robustness of Special States under Dephasing Channel

The dephasing channel is a model that reﬂects the decay of nondiagonal elements for density matrix with time. In this channel, we ﬁrst consider the three-qubtit system ABC be in a pure state

But we will show that the entanglement dynamics of state | is diﬀerent from that of state | under the same dephasing channel. The details are given in Appendix A.3.
4.2. Robustness of Three-Qubit Pure States under Dephasing Channel
Similar to the case of the study on decoherence process of threequbit states under amplitude damping channel, we also explored the decoherence process of all three-qubit pure states under dephasing channel systematically. According to Equation (A.10) in Appendix A.2, it is easily to get the degree of dephasing, p = 0.5, p = 0.75, p = 0.875, and p = 0.9375, when the initial entanglement N0 decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16 for the robust state | in (16), respectively. We plot these four curves with red solid lines in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 2, respectively. As for the decoherence process of the state | in (17), by using numerical methods according to Equation (A.15) in Appendix A.3, one can get the degree of dephasing p when the negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16, respectively. We also plot these four curves with green dashed lines in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 2, respectively.
For each random sampled three-qubit pure state under dephasing channel, we compute the degree of dephasing p when its negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16, respectively. These degrees of dephasing values p are plotted in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 2 with solid black dots when the negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16, respectively.

5. Robustness of Entanglement under Bit Flip Channel
5.1. Robustness of Special States under Bit Flip Channel
The bit ﬂip channel ﬂips the state of a qubit between |0 and |1 with a certain probability and each qubit is aﬀected by the noise correspondingly, which is the same as dephasing channel up to local rotation. For this channel, the states | in (17) and | in (16), which contain the same entanglement properties and the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence in robustness under dephasing channel, are investigated in Appendix sections A.4 and A.5, respectively.
5.2. Robustness of Three-Qubit Pure States under Bit Flip Channel
Similar to the cases of the study on decoherence process of threequbit states under amplitude damping channel and dephasing channel, the decoherence process of all three-qubit pure states under bit ﬂip channel are also explored. We plot the degree of bit ﬂip p for the state | in (17), the state | in (16), and random sampled states under bit ﬂip channel when the negativity decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16 with green dashed lines, red solid lines, and solid black dots in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 3, respectively.
From each inset in the ﬁgure, one can see obviously that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the degree of bit ﬂip p, measure of the robustness of the random sampled states, and the initial entanglement N0. Moreover, it is obvious that p is not higher than the green dashed lines and not lower than the red solid lines when the negativity of random sampled states decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16, respectively. As the same unitary operation also connects the bit ﬂip channel with the dephasing channel, the state | in (17) is the most robust one and the state | in (16) is the most fragile one during decoherence under bit ﬂip channel.
6. Discussion and Summary
We have investigated the decoherence process of three-qubit states under three typical noise channels systematically. We use

Figure 3. Robustness of entanglement for three-qubit pure states under bit ﬂip channel. We plot the degree of bit ﬂip p when the quantum entanglement decreases to N0/2, N0/4, N0/8, and N0/16 in insets (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. Robustness of a three-qubit system in the state | , the state | , and 40 000 random sampled pure states under bit ﬂip channel are shown with solid (red) lines, dashed (green) lines, or solid (black) dots, respectively.
the degree of decoherence noise that induces the initial entanglement N0 decay to N0/c (c = 2, 4, 8, and 16) as the quantiﬁer of robustness during decoherence. With the help of the random matrices method to produce all three-qubit pure states, we obtained the numerical and analytical results for the stability of all threequbit entangled states against noise during decoherence process. We compared the robustness of special quantum states with that of random pure states, and found the most robust states and the most fragile ones during decoherence under typical local decoherence models. Moreover, we found that these states, which exhibit the largest possible diﬀerence in robustness, actually contain the same entanglement properties. Furthermore, we found that the most robust states under dephasing channel are the most fragile ones under the bit ﬂip channel, and the most fragile states under dephasing channel are the most robust ones under the bit ﬂip channel.
Our present work focuses on the three-qubit entangled states. It would be interesting to see if the above observations hold true for other multiqubit pure states under typical decoherence models. Furthermore, we showed that although local unitary operations cannot change the entanglement properties of a state, it can greatly enhance the robustness of a system against decoherence. This provides a possible way for protecting the robust quantum states against decoherence through appropriate local unitary operations.

sity matrix of state (17) are so fragile as to be greatly aﬀected by

the action of dephasing channel. The entanglement of the state

expressed as

One can obviously see that the exponent of parameter s is not more than 2 in all matrix elements of Equation (A.16), which implies that the most fragile state | under dephasing channel is so robust as to be less aﬀected by the bit ﬂip noise. The entanglement of the state (17) during the evolution under bit ﬂip channel can be expressed as

Interestingly, the exponent of parameter s reaches 3 in some matrix elements of Equation (A.20), which implies that the most robust state | under dephasing channel is so fragile as to be greatly aﬀected by the bit ﬂip noise.
