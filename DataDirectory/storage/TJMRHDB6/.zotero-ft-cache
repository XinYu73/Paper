Quantum Phase Transitions
Second Edition
This is the ﬁrst book to describe the physical properties of quantum materials near critical points with long-range many-body quantum entanglement. Readers are introduced to the basic theory of quantum phases, their phase transitions, and their observable properties.
This second edition begins with nine chapters, six of them new, suitable for an introductory course on quantum phase transitions, assuming no prior knowledge of quantum ﬁeld theory. There are several new chapters covering important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at nonzero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models is explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory.

From the Preface to the ﬁrst edition
The past decade has seen a substantial rejuvenation of interest in the study of quantum phase transitions, driven by experiments on cuprate superconductors, heavy fermion materials, organic conductors, and related compounds. Although quantum phase transitions in simple spin systems, like the Ising model in a transverse ﬁeld, were studied in the early 1970s, much of the subsequent theoretical work examined a particular example: the metal– insulator transition. While this is a subject of considerable experimental importance, the greatest theoretical progress was made for the case of the Anderson transition of noninteracting electrons, which is driven by localization of the electronic states in the presence of a random potential. The critical properties of this transition of noninteracting electrons constituted the primary basis upon which most condensed matter physicists have formed their intuition on the behavior of the systems near a quantum phase transition. However, it is clear that strong electronic interactions play a crucial role in the systems of current interest noted earlier, and simple paradigms for the behavior of such systems near quantum critical points are not widely known.
It is the purpose of this book to move interactions to center stage by describing and classifying the physical properties of the simplest interacting systems undergoing a quantum phase transition. The effects of disorder will be neglected for the most part but will be considered in the concluding chapters. Our focus will be on the dynamical properties of such systems at nonzero temperature, and it will become apparent that these differ substantially from the noninteracting case. We shall also be considering inelastic collision-dominated quantum dynamics and transport: our results will apply to clean physical systems whose inelastic scattering time is much shorter than their disorder-induced elastic scattering time. This is the converse of the usual theoretical situation in Anderson localization or mesoscopic system theory, where inelastic collision times are conventionally taken to be much larger than all other timescales.
One of the most interesting and signiﬁcant regimes of the systems we shall study is one in which the inelastic scattering and phase coherence times are of order /kB T , where T is the absolute temperature. The importance of such a regime was pointed out by Varma et al. [523, 524] by an analysis of transport and optical data on the cuprate superconductors. Neutron scattering measurements of Hayden et al. [210] and Keimer et al. [263] also supported such an interpretation in the low doping region. It was subsequently realized [86, 419, 440] that the inelastic rates are in fact a universal number times kB T / , and they are a robust property of the high-temperature limit of renormalizable, interacting quantum ﬁeld theories that are not asymptotically free at high energies. In the Wilsonian picture, such a ﬁeld theory is deﬁned by renormalization group ﬂows away from a critical point describing a second-order quantum phase transition. It is not essential for this xiii

From the Preface to the ﬁrst edition

critical point to be in an experimentally accessible regime of the phase diagram: the quantum ﬁeld theory it deﬁnes may still be an appropriate description of the physics over a substantial intermediate energy and temperature scale. Among the implications of such an interpretation of the experiments was the requirement that response functions should have prefactors of anomalous powers of T and a singular dependence on the wavevector; recent observations of Aeppli et al. [5], at somewhat higher dopings, appear to be consistent with this. These recent experiments also suggest that the appropriate quantum critical points involve competition between phases with or without conventional superconducting, spin-, or charge-density-wave order. There is no global theory yet for such quantum transitions, but we shall discuss numerous simpler models here that capture some of the basic features.
It is also appropriate to note here theoretical studies [25, 93, 94, 336, 514] on the relevance of ﬁnite temperature crossovers near quantum critical points of Fermi liquids [218] to the physics of heavy fermion compounds.
A separate motivation for the study of quantum phase transitions is simply the value in having another perspective on the physics of an interacting many-body system. A traditional analysis of such a system would begin from either a weak-coupling Hamiltonian, and then build in interactions among the nearly free excitations, or a strong-coupling limit, where the local interactions are well accounted for, but their coherent propagation through the system is not fully described. In contrast, a quantum critical point begins from an intermediate coupling regime, which straddles these limiting cases. One can then use the powerful technology of scaling to set up a systematic expansion of physical properties away from the special critical point. For many low-dimensional strongly correlated systems, I believe that such an approach holds the most promise for a comprehensive understanding. Many of the vexing open problems are related to phenomena at intermediate temperatures, and this is precisely the region over which the inﬂuence of a quantum critical point is dominant. Related motivations for the study of quantum phase transitions appear in a recent discourse by Laughlin [286].
The particular quantum phase transitions that are examined in this book are undoubtedly heavily inﬂuenced by my own research. However, I believe that my choices can also be justiﬁed on pedagogical grounds and lead to a logical development of the main physical concepts in the simplest possible contexts. Throughout, I have also attempted to provide experimental motivations for the models considered; this is mainly in the form of a guide to the literature, rather than in-depth discussion of the experimental issues. I have highlighted some especially interesting experiments in a recent popular introduction to quantum phase transitions [428]. An experimentally oriented introduction to the subject of quantum phase transitions can also be found in the excellent review article of Sondhi, Girvin, Carini, and Shahar [481]. Readers may also be interested in a recent introductory article [533], intended for a general science audience.

From the Preface to the ﬁrst edition

Some portions of this book grew out of lectures and write-ups I prepared for schools and conferences in Trieste, Italy [418], Xiamen, China [419], Madrid, Spain [421], Geilo, Norway [424], and Seoul, Korea [427]. I am obliged to Professors Yu Lu, S. Lundqvist, G. Morandi, Hao Bai-Lin, German Sierra, Miguel Martin-Delgado, Arne Skjeltorp, David Sherrington, Jisoon Ihm, Yunkyu Bang, and Jaejun Yu for the opportunities to present these lectures. I also taught two graduate courses at Yale University and a mini-course at the Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France on topics discussed in this book; I thank both institutions for arranging and supporting these courses. I am indebted to the participants and students at these lectures for stimulating discussions, valuable feedback, and their interest. Part of this book was written during a sojourn at the Laboratoire des Champs Magnétiques Intenses in Grenoble, and I thank Professors Claude Berthier and Benoy Chakraverty for their hospitality. My research has been supported by grants from the Division of Materials Research of the U.S. National Science Foundation.
I have been fortunate in having the beneﬁt of interactions and collaborations with numerous colleagues and students who have generously shared insights that appear in many of these pages. I would particularly like to thank my collaborators Chiranjeeb Buragohain, Andrey Chubukov, Kedar Damle, Sankar Das Sarma, Antoine Georges, Ilya Gruzberg, Satya Majumdar, Reinhold Oppermann, Nick Read, R. Shankar, T. Senthil, Sasha Sokol, Matthias Troyer, Jinwu Ye, Peter Young, and Lian Zheng.
The evolution of the book owes a great deal to comments of readers of earlier versions, who unselﬁshly donated their time in working through unpolished drafts; naturally, they bear no responsibility for the remaining errors and obscurities. I am most grateful to Sudip Chakravarty, Andrey Chubukov, Kedar Damle, Ilya Gruzberg, Sankar Das Sarma, Bert Halperin, T. Senthil, R. Shankar, Oleg Starykh, Chandra Varma, Peter Young, Jan Zaanen, and two anonymous referees. The detailed comments provided by Steve Girvin and Wim van Saarloos were especially valuable. My thanks to them, and the others, accompany an admiration for their generous collegial spirit. I also acknowledge salutary encouragement from Jan Zaanen.
My wife, Usha, and my daughters, Monisha and Menaka, patiently tolerated my mental and physical absences during the writing (and rewritings) of this book. Ultimately, it was their cheerful support that made the project possible and worthwhile.

Preface to the second edition
Research on quantum phase transitions has undergone a vast expansion since the publication of the ﬁrst edition, over a decade ago. Many new theoretical ideas have emerged, and the arena of experimental systems has grown rapidly. The cuprates have been ﬁrmly established to be d-wave superconductors, with a massless Dirac spectrum for their electronic excitations; the latter spectrum has also been observed in graphene and on the surface of topological insulators. Such fermions play a key role in a variety of quantum phase transitions. The observation of quantum oscillations in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds in the underdoped cuprates has highlighted the relevance of competing orders, and their quantum critical points. Optical lattices of ultracold atoms now offer a realization of the boson Hubbard model, and exhibit the superﬂuid–insulator transition. And ideas on quantum criticality and entanglement have had an interesting interplay with developments in quantum information science.
The second edition does not present a fully comprehensive survey of these ongoing developments. I believe the core topics of the ﬁrst edition had a certain coherence, and they continue to be central to the more modern developments; I did not wish to dilute the global perspective they offer in understanding both condensed matter and ultracold atom experiments. However, wherever possible, I have discussed important advances, or directed the reader to review articles.
Also, in the last few years, a remarkable connection has developed between ideas on quantum criticality and the string theory of quantum black holes. I brieﬂy survey the initial developments in Section 15.5. The subject has advanced rapidly since then, with interesting applications to quantum critical states of fermions at nonzero density: this recent work is not discussed here. In any case, this book should be useful background reading for this emerging and growing ﬁeld of research.
The primary change in the second edition is pedagogical. I have had the beneﬁt of teaching a course on quantum phase transitions several times since the ﬁrst edition, both at Yale and at Harvard. I am also grateful for the opportunity to lecture at various summer and winter schools (Altenberg, Boulder, Cargese, Goa, Groningen, Jerusalem, Les Houches, Mahabaleshwar, Milos, Prague, Trieste, Windsor). The content of these lectures is now in the new Part II of the book. Chapters 3–8 are new, although they do extract some material from the earlier chapters of the ﬁrst edition. Part II, titled “A ﬁrst course,” is intended for a stand-alone course on the basic theory of quantum phase transitions, and for self-study. It should be accessible to students in both theory and experiment, after they have taken the core graduate courses on quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. No prior knowledge of quantum ﬁeld theory is assumed. Exercises are included at the ends of chapters, drawn from the problem sets of my courses. xvii

Preface to the second edition

After completing Part II, a course can choose from the more advanced topics in Parts III and IV. I recommend a basic survey of the nonzero temperature phase diagram from Chapters 10 and 11. This can be followed by a treatment of Fermi systems drawn from Chapters 17 and 18. Chapters 19 and 20 offer many possibilities for student presentations.
The chapters in the new Parts III and IV have been signiﬁcantly updated from the ﬁrst edition. Chapter 16 has a new section on the Fermi gas near unitarity: this was a simple and natural extension of the previous discussion on dilute quantum liquids. These results apply to ultracold atomic systems near a Feshbach resonance. Chapter 17, on Dirac fermions, is entirely new. I took this opportunity to introduce the basics of the theory of unconventional superconductivity induced by antiferromagnetism, as it applies to the cuprates and the pnictides. Dirac fermions also offer a gentle way of introducing non-trivial quantum phase transitions of Fermi systems. Chapter 18, on Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, has been almost completely re-written: this reﬂects advances in our understanding, and its relevance in many experimental contexts. Chapter 19, on quantum magnetism, has numerous updates to reﬂect our improved understanding of spin liquids, and a brief discussion of deconﬁned criticality. However, I have not attempted to cover the many modern developments in quantum magnetism: a more comprehensive starting point is offered by my Solvay lecture [430].
My web site, http://sachdev.physics.harvard.edu, will have updates and corrections.

I thank the Perimeter Institute, Waterloo for hospitality while I was working on the second edition. Finally, I remain grateful to the National Science Foundation for continued support of my research.

PART I
INTRODUCTION

Basic concepts

1.1 What is a quantum phase transition?

Consider a Hamiltonian, H (g), whose degrees of freedom reside on the sites of a lattice, and which varies as a function of a dimensionless coupling, g. Let us follow the evolution of the ground state energy of H (g) as a function of g. For the case of a ﬁnite lattice, this ground state energy will generically be a smooth, analytic function of g. The main possibility of an exception comes from the case when g couples only to a conserved quantity (i.e. H (g) = H0 + g H1, where H0 and H1 commute). This means that H0 and H1 can be simultaneously diagonalized and so the eigenfunctions are independent of g even though the eigenvalues vary with g; then there can be a level-crossing where an excited level becomes the ground state at g = gc (say), creating a point of nonanalyticity of the ground state energy as a function of g (see Fig. 1.1). The possibilities for an inﬁnite lattice are richer. An avoided level-crossing between the ground and an excited state in a ﬁnite lattice could become progressively sharper as the lattice size increases, leading to a nonanalyticity at g = gc in the inﬁnite lattice limit. We shall identify any point of nonanalyticity in the ground state energy of the inﬁnite lattice system as a quantum phase transition: The nonanalyticity could be either the limiting case of an avoided level-crossing or an actual level-crossing. The ﬁrst kind is more common, but we shall also discuss transitions of the second kind in Chapters 16 and 19. The phase transition is usually accompanied by a qualitative change in the nature of the correlations in the ground state, and describing this change will clearly be one of our major interests.
Actually our focus will be on a limited class of quantum phase transitions – those that are second order. Loosely speaking, these are transitions at which the characteristic energy scale of ﬂuctuations above the ground state vanishes as g approaches gc. Let the energy
represent a scale characterizing some signiﬁcant spectral density of ﬂuctuations at zero temperature (T ) for g = gc. Thus could be the energy of the lowest excitation above the ground state, if this is nonzero (i.e. there is an energy gap ), or if there are excitations at arbitrarily low energies in the inﬁnite lattice limit (i.e. the energy spectrum is gapless), is the scale at which there is a qualitative change in the nature of the frequency spectrum from its lowest frequency to its higher frequency behavior. In most cases, we will ﬁnd that as g approaches gc, vanishes as

Low eigenvalues, E, of a Hamiltonian H(g) on a ﬁnite lattice, as a function of some dimensionless coupling, g. For the case where H(g) = H0 + gH1, where H0 and H1 commute and are independent of g, there can be an actual level-crossing, as in (a). More generally, however, there is an “avoided level-crossing,” as in (b).

(exceptions to this behavior appear in Section 20.2.6). Here J is the energy scale of a characteristic microscopic coupling, and zν is a critical exponent. The value of zν is usually universal, that is, it is independent of most of the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian H (g) (we shall have much more to say about the concept of universality below, and in the following chapters). The behavior (1.1) holds both for g > gc and for g < gc with the same value of the exponent zν, but with different nonuniversal constants of proportionality. We shall sometimes use the symbol + ( −) to represent the characteristic energy scale for g > gc (g < gc).
In addition to a vanishing energy scale, second-order quantum phase transitions invariably have a diverging characteristic length scale ξ . This could be the length scale determining the exponential decay of equal-time correlations in the ground state or the length scale at which some characteristic crossover occurs to the correlations at the longest distances. This length diverges as

ξ −1 ∼ |g − gc|ν ,

(1.2)

where ν is a critical exponent, and is an inverse length scale (a “momentum cutoff”) of order the inverse lattice spacing. The ratio of the exponents in (1.1) and (1.2) is z, the dynamic critical exponent. The characteristic energy scale vanishes as the zth power of the characteristic inverse length scale

∼ ξ −z.

(1.3)

It is important to note that the discussion above refers to singularities in the ground state of the system. So strictly speaking, quantum phase transitions occur only at zero temperature, T = 0. Because all experiments are necessarily at some nonzero, though

1.2 Nonzero temperature transitions and crossovers

possibly very small, temperature, a central task of the theory of quantum phase transitions is to describe the consequences of this T = 0 singularity on physical properties at T > 0. It turns out that working outward from the quantum critical point at g = gc and T = 0 is a powerful way of understanding and describing the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of numerous systems over a broad range of values of |g − gc| and T . Indeed, it is not even necessary that the system of interest ever have its microscopic couplings reach a value such that g = gc: it can still be very useful to argue that there is a quantum critical point at a physically inaccessible coupling g = gc and to develop a description in the deviation |g − gc|. It is one of the purposes of this book to describe the physical perspective that such an approach offers, and to contrast it with more conventional expansions about very weak (say g → 0) or very strong couplings (say g → ∞).

1.2 Nonzero temperature transitions and crossovers

Let us now discuss some basic aspects of the T > 0 phase diagram. First, let us ask only about the presence of phase transitions at nonzero T . With this limited criterion, there are two important possibilities for the T > 0 phase diagram of a system near a quantum critical point. These are shown in Fig. 1.2, and we will meet examples of both kinds in this book. In the ﬁrst, shown in Fig. 1.2a, the thermodynamic singularity is present only at T = 0, and all T > 0 properties are analytic as a function of g near g = gc. In the second, shown in

Two possible phase diagrams of a system near a quantum phase transition. In both cases there is a quantum critical point at g = gc and T = 0. In (b), there is a line of T > 0 second-order phase transitions terminating at the quantum critical point. The theory of phase transitions in classical systems driven by thermal ﬂuctuations can be applied within the shaded region of (b).

Basic concepts

Fig. 1.2b, there is a line of T > 0 second-order phase transitions (this is a line at which the thermodynamic free energy is not analytic) that terminates at the T = 0 quantum critical point at g = gc.
Moving beyond phase transitions, let us ask some basic questions about the dynamics of the system. A very general way to characterize the dynamics at T > 0 is in terms of the thermal equilibration time τeq. This is the characteristic time in which local thermal equilibrium is established after imposition of a weak external perturbation (say, a heat pulse). Here we are excluding equilibration with respect to globally conserved quantities (such as energy or charge) which will take a long time to equilibrate, dependent upon the length scale of the perturbation: hence the emphasis on local equilibration. Global equilibration is described by the equations of hydrodynamics, and we expect such equations to apply in all cases at times much larger than τeq. We focus here on the value of τeq as a function of g − gc and T . From the energy scales discussed in Section 1.1, we can immediately draw an important distinction between two regimes of the phase diagram. We characterized the ground state by the energy in (1.1). At nonzero temperature, we have a second energy scale, kB T . Comparing the values of and kB T , we are immediately led to the important phase diagram in Fig. 1.3. We will see that the two regimes, > kB T and
< kB T , are distinguished by different theories of thermal equilibration and of the values of τeq. In the regime where > kB T , we will always ﬁnd long equilibration times which satisfy

τeq

, kBT

> kBT.

(1.4)

One of the important consequences of this large value of τeq is that the dynamics of the system becomes effectively classical. Thus we can use classical equations of motion to describe the re-equilibration dynamics at the time scale τeq.
Let us now turn our attention to the important “Quantum Critical” region in Fig. 1.3, where kB T > . We shall mainly be interested in quantum critical points which are strongly interacting, and not amenable to a nearly-free particle description. In such cases we ﬁnd a short equilibration time given by

T

Separation of the phase diagram into distinct regimes determined by the energy scale , which characterizes the ground state, and kBT. The dashed lines are not phase transitions, but smooth crossovers at T ∼ |g − gc|zν. The phase transition in Fig. 1.2b lies within the > kBT region, and is not shown above.

1.2 Nonzero temperature transitions and crossovers

τeq ∼ kB T , kB T > .

(1.5)

Now the equilibration occurs in a time which is actually independent of the microscopic
energy scale J , and is determined by kB T alone. Moreover, and most interestingly, we cannot use an effectively classical description for the re-equilibration at times of order τeq. Quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations are equally important in the dynamics in the quantum
critical region, and developing a theory for this dynamics will be a central focus of Part III. What about the T > 0 phase transition line in Fig. 1.2b? We have not shown this line
in Fig. 1.3. Such a transition should be viewed as reﬂecting the physics of the > kB T region, and so the transition line lies in the corresponding region of Fig. 1.3. In other words, this transition is not really a property of the quantum critical point at g = gc, but of the quantum phase at g < gc. (There could also be a separate transition reﬂecting the physics of the g > gc phase, which we have not shown in our phase diagrams.) As we move closer to this phase transition line, we will show that not only does τeq become long, but so do all the time scales associated with long wavelength thermal ﬂuctuations. Indeed we will
ﬁnd that the typical frequency at which the important long-distance degrees of freedom ﬂuctuate, ωtyp, satisﬁes

ωtyp kB T .

(1.6)

Under these conditions, it will be seen that a purely classical description can be applied to these important degrees of freedom – this classical description works in the shaded region of Fig. 1.2b. Consequently, the ultimate critical singularity along the line of T > 0 phase transitions in Fig. 1.2b is described by the theory of second-order phase transitions in classical systems. This theory was developed thoroughly in the past three decades and has been explained in many popular reviews and books [59, 172, 244, 312, 557]. We will discuss the needed basic features of this theory in Chapters 3 and 4. Note that the shaded region of classical behavior in Fig. 1.2b lies within the wider window of the phase diagram, with moderate values of |g − gc| and T , which we asserted above should be described as an expansion about the quantum critical point at g = gc and T = 0. So our study of quantum phase transitions will also apply to the shaded region of Fig. 1.2b, where it will yield information complementary to that available by directly thinking of the T > 0 phase transition in terms of purely classical models.
We note that phase transitions in classical models are driven only by thermal ﬂuctuations, as classical systems usually freeze into a ﬂuctuationless ground state at T = 0. In contrast, quantum systems have ﬂuctuations driven by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle even in the ground state, and these can drive interesting phase transitions at T = 0. The T > 0 region in the vicinity of a quantum critical point therefore offers a fascinating interplay of effects driven by quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations; sometimes, as in the shaded region of Fig. 1.2b, we can ﬁnd some dominant, effective degrees of freedom whose ﬂuctuations are purely classical and thermal, and then the classical theory will apply. However, as already noted, our attention will not be limited to such regions, and we shall be interested in a broader section of the phase diagram.

1.3 Experimental examples

To make the concepts of the previous sections less abstract, let us mention some experimental studies of simple second-order quantum phase transitions. We will meet numerous other examples in this book, but for now we focus on examples directly related to the canonical theoretical models of quantum phase transitions to be discussed in Section 1.4, and in Parts II and III.
• The low-lying magnetic excitations of the insulator LiHoF4 consist of ﬂuctuations of the Ho ions between two spin states that are aligned parallel and antiparallel to a particular crystalline axis. These states can be represented by a two-state “Ising” spin variable on each Ho ion. At T = 0, the magnetic dipolar interactions between the Ho ions cause all the Ising spins to align in the same orientation, and so the ground state is a ferromagnet. Bitko, Rosenbaum, and Aeppli [49] placed this material in a magnetic ﬁeld transverse to the magnetic axis. Such a ﬁeld induces quantum tunneling between the two states of each Ho ion, and a sufﬁciently strong tunneling rate can eventually destroy the longrange magnetic order. Such a quantum phase transition was indeed observed [49], with the ferromagnetic moment vanishing continuously at a quantum critical point. Note that such a transition can, in principle, occur precisely at T = 0, when it is driven entirely by quantum ﬂuctuations. We shall call the T = 0 state without magnetic order a quantum paramagnet. However, we can also destroy the magnetic order at a ﬁxed transverse magnetic ﬁeld (possibly zero), simply by raising the temperature, enabling the material to undergo a conventional Curie transition to a high-temperature magnetically disordered state. Among the objectives of this book is to provide a description of the intricate crossover between the zero-temperature quantum transition and the ﬁnite-temperature transition driven partially by thermal ﬂuctuations; we shall also delineate the important differences between the T = 0 quantum paramagnet and the high-temperature “thermal paramagnet;” see Chapters 11, 13, and 14.
A more recent realization of an Ising model in a transverse ﬁeld has appeared in experiments by Coldea and collaborators [90] on crystals of CoNb2O6, which belongs to the columbite family of minerals. In this case, the Ising spin resides on the Co++ ion, again aligned by the spin–orbit interaction to orient parallel or anti-parallel to a crystalline axis. An important difference from LiHoF4 is that the interactions between the spins are essentially nearest-neighbor, and the long-range dipolar couplings are unimportant; the short-range interactions arise from the Heisenberg exchange process, and their energy scale is determined by the electrostatic Coulomb interactions. Thus CoNb2O6 provides a nearly ideal realization of the quantum Ising models which will be the focus of our study in Parts II and III. The dominant exchange couplings are along a particular crystalline axis, and so it is also a useful testing ground for exact results in one dimension. • Experiments on ultracold atoms in optical lattices by Greiner, Bloch, and collaborators [175] have provided a celebrated example of the superﬂuid–insulator quantum phase transition. Atoms of 87Rb are cooled to temperatures so low that their quantum statistics

9

1.4 Theoretical models

is important. These atoms are bosons and so they ultimately Bose condense into a superﬂuid state. Then, by applying a periodic potential on the atoms by an optical lattice, Greiner et al. localized the atoms in the minima of the periodic potential, leading to a quantum phase transition to an insulating state. At densities where the number of atoms is commensurate with the number of minima of the periodic potential, this transition is described by the O(2) quantum rotor model, which we introduce in Section 1.4 and discuss at length in Parts II and III. • TlCuCl3 is an insulator whose only low-lying electronic excitations are rotations of the S = 1/2 spins residing on the Cu++ ions. Unlike the case for the Co++ ions in CoNb2O6, the spin-orbit interactions are relatively weak on Cu++, and a single spin can freely orient along any direction in spin space. A special feature of the crystal structure of TlCuCl3 is that the Cu atoms are naturally dimerized, i.e. each Cu site has a single partner Cu site, and the exchange interactions are strongest between the partners in each pair. The exchange interaction has an antiferromagnetic sign, and consequently neighboring spins prefer to be oriented in anti-parallel directions. Under ambient pressure, each Cu spin forms a singlet valence bond with its partner, much like that between the two electrons in a hydrogen molecule. Thus although the neighboring spins within a dimer are always anti-parallel, they ﬂuctuate along all directions in spin space in a rotationally invariant manner. We will refer to this state as a quantum paramagnet; it has an energy gap to all excitations above the ground state. Under applied pressure, TlCuCl3 undergoes a quantum phase transition [414] to an ordered antiferromagnet: a Néel state. In this Néel state, the spins freeze into a deﬁnite orientation so that nearby spins are anti-parallel to each other. Such an arrangement is more nearly optimal when the exchange couplings between spins in different dimers are signiﬁcant. As we discuss below in Section 1.4, this transition between the quantum paramagnet and the Néel state is described by the O(3) quantum rotor model, which will also be discussed in Parts II and III.

1.4 Theoretical models

Our strategy in this book will be to thoroughly analyze the physical properties of quantum phase transitions in two simple theoretical model systems in Parts II and III: the quantum Ising and rotor models. Fortunately, these simple models also have direct experimental realizations in the systems already surveyed in Section 1.3. Below, we introduce the quantum Ising and rotor models in turn, discussing the nature of the quantum phase transitions in them, and relating them to the experimental systems above. Other experimental connections will be discussed in subsequent chapters.
Part IV will survey some important quantum phase transitions in other models of physical interest. Our motivation in dividing the discussion in this manner is mainly pedagogical: the quantum transitions of the Ising/rotor models have an essential simplicity, but their behavior is rich enough to display most of the basic phenomena we wish to explore. It will therefore pay to meet the central physical ideas in this simple context ﬁrst.

We begin by writing down the Hamiltonian of the quantum Ising model. It is

HI = −Jg

(1.7)

As in the general notation introduced above, J > 0 is an exchange constant, which sets

the microscopic energy scale, and g > 0 is a dimensionless coupling, which will be used

to tune HI across a quantum phase transition. The quantum degrees of freedom are repre-

sented sions;

by the

operators sum i j

reside on the sites, i, of a of nearest-neighbor sites

hypercubic lattice i , j . The σˆix,z are

in d dimenthe familiar

Pauli matrices; the matrices on different sites i act on different spin states, and so matrices

with i = j commute with each other. In the basis where the σˆiz are diagonal, these matrices

have the well-known form

σˆ y =

σˆ x =

(1.8)

on each site i. We will denote the eigenvalues of σˆiz simply by σiz, and so σiz takes the values ±1. We identify the two states with eigenvalues σiz = +1, −1 as the two possible orientations of an “Ising spin,” which can be oriented up or down in | ↑ i , | ↓ i . Consequently at g = 0, when HI involves only the σˆiz, HI will be diagonal in the basis of eigenvalues of σˆiz, and it reduces simply to the familiar classical Ising model. However, the σˆix are offdiagonal in the basis of these states, and therefore they induce quantum-mechanical tunnel-
ing events that ﬂip the orientation of the Ising spin on a site. The physical signiﬁcance of
the two terms in HI should be clear in the context of our earlier discussion in Section 1.3 for LiHoF4 and CoNb2O6. The term proportional to J is the magnetic interaction between the spins, which prefers their global ferromagnetic alignment. While the interaction in LiHoF4 has a long-range dipolar nature, that in CoNb2O6 has a nearest-neighbor form like that in (1.7). The term proportional to J g is the applied external transverse magnetic ﬁeld, which
disrupts the magnetic order.
Let us make these qualitative considerations somewhat more precise. The ground state
of HI can depend only upon the value of the dimensionless coupling g, and so it pays to consider the two opposing limits g 1 and g 1.
First consider g 1. In this case the ﬁrst term in (1.7) dominates, and, to leading order in 1/g, the ground state is simply

|0 = | → i ,
i

(1.9)

where

√ | → i = (| ↑ i + | ↓ i )/√2, | ← i = (| ↑ i − | ↓ i )/ 2,

are the two eigenstates of σˆix with eigenvalues ±1. The values of σiz on different sites are

totally uncorrelated in the state (1.9), and so

1/g will build in correlations in σ z that increase in range at each order in 1/g; for g large enough these correlations are expected to remain short-ranged, and we expect in general that

for large |xi − x j |, where xi is the spatial coordinate of site i, |0 is the exact ground state for large-g, and ξ is the “correlation length” introduced above (1.2).
Next we consider the opposing limit g 1. We will ﬁnd that the nature of the ground
state is qualitatively different from the large-g limit above, and we shall use this to argue
that there must be a quantum phase transition between the two limiting cases at a critical g = gc of order unity. For g 1, the second term in (1.7) coupling neighboring sites dominates; at g = 0 the spins are either all up or all down (in eigenstates of σ z):

|↑ = | ↑ i or |↓ = |↓ i .

i

i

(1.12)

Turning on a small-g will mix in a small fraction of spins of the opposite orientation, but in
an inﬁnite system the degeneracy will survive at any ﬁnite order in a perturbation theory in
g. This is because there is an exact global Z2 symmetry transformation (generated by the unitary operator i σix ), which maps the two ground states into each other, under which HI remains invariant:

σˆiz → −σˆiz, σˆix → −σˆix ,

(1.13)

and there is no tunneling matrix element between the majority up and down spin sectors of the inﬁnite system at any ﬁnite order in g. The mathematically alert reader will note that establishing the degeneracy to all orders in g, is not the same thing as establishing its existence for any small nonzero g, but more sophisticated considerations show that this is indeed the case. A thermodynamic system will always choose one or other of the states as its ground states (which may be preferred by some inﬁnitesimal external perturbation), and this is commonly referred to as a “spontaneous breaking” of the Z2 symmetry. As in the large-g limit, we can characterize the ground states by the behavior of correlations of σˆiz; the nature of the states (1.12) and small-g perturbation theory suggest that

lim
|xi −x j |→∞

σˆiz

σˆ

z j

= N02,

(1.14)

where |0 is either of the ground states obtained from | ↑ or | ↓ by perturbation theory in g, and N0 = 0 is the “spontaneous magnetization” of the ground state. This identiﬁcation is made clearer by the simpler statement

0 σˆiz 0 = ±N0,

(1.15)

which also follows from the perturbation theory in g. We have N0 = 1 for g = 0, but quantum ﬂuctuations at small-g reduce N0 to a smaller, but nonzero, value.
Now we make the simple observation that it is not possible for states that obey (1.11)

and (1.14) to transform into each other analytically as a function of g. There must be a critical value g = gc at which the large |xi − x j | limit of the two-point correlator changes from (1.11) to (1.14 ) – this is the position of the quantum phase transition, which is the

12

Basic concepts

focus of intensive study in this book. Our arguments so far do not exclude the possibility
that there could be more than one critical point, but this is known not to happen for HI , and we will assume here that there is only one critical point at g = gc. For g > gc the ground state is, as noted earlier, a quantum paramagnet, and (1.11) is obeyed. We will ﬁnd that as g approaches gc from above, the correlation length, ξ , diverges as in (1.2). Precisely at g = gc, neither (1.11) nor (1.14) is obeyed, and we ﬁnd instead a power-law dependence on |xi − x j | at large distances. The result (1.14) holds for all g < gc, when the ground state is magnetically ordered. The spontaneous magnetization of the ground state, N0, vanishes as a power law as g approaches gc from below.
Finally, we make a comment about the excited states of HI . In a ﬁnite lattice, there is necessarily a nonzero energy separating the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state. How-
ever, this energy spacing can either remain ﬁnite or approach zero in the inﬁnite lattice
limit, the two cases being identiﬁed as having a gapped or gapless energy spectrum, respectively. We will ﬁnd that there is an energy gap that is nonzero for all g = gc, but that it vanishes upon approaching gc as in (1.1), producing a gapless spectrum at g = gc.

1.4.2 Quantum rotor model

We turn to the somewhat less familiar quantum rotor models. Elementary quantum rotors do not exist in nature; rather, each quantum rotor is an effective quantum degree of freedom for the low-energy states of a small number of electrons or atoms. We will ﬁrst deﬁne the quantum mechanics of a single rotor and then turn to the lattice quantum rotor model. The connection to the experimental models introduced in Section 1.3 is described below in Section 1.4.3. Further details of this connection appear in Chapters 9 and 19.
Each rotor can be visualized as a particle constrained to move on the surface of a (ﬁctitious) (N > 1)-dimensional sphere. The orientation of each rotor is represented by an N -component unit vector nˆ i which satisﬁes

nˆ i2 = 1.

(1.16)

The caret on nˆ i reminds us that the orientation of the rotor is a quantum mechanical operator, while i represents the site on which the rotor resides; we will shortly consider an inﬁnite number of such rotors residing on the sites of a d-dimensional lattice. Each rotor has a momentum pˆ i , and the constraint (1.16) implies that this must be tangential to the surface of the N -dimensional sphere. The rotor position and momentum satisfy the usual commutation relations

[nˆα, pˆβ ] = i δαβ

(1.17)

on each site i; here α, β = 1 . . . N . (Here, and in the remainder of the book, we will always measure time in units in which

= 1,

(1.18)

unless stated explicitly otherwise. This is also a good point to note that we will also set Boltzmann’s constant

13

1.4 Theoretical models

kB = 1

(1.19)

by absorbing it into the units of temperature, T .) We will actually ﬁnd it more convenient to work with the N (N − 1)/2 components of the rotor angular momentum

Lˆ αβ = nˆα pˆβ − nˆβ pˆα.

(1.20)

These operators are the generators of the group of rotations in N dimensions, denoted
O(N ). Their commutation relations follow straightforwardly from (1.17) and (1.20). The case N = 3 will be of particular interest to us. For this we deﬁne Lˆ α = (1/2) αβγ Lβγ (where αβγ is a totally antisymmetric tensor with 123 = 1), and then the commutation
relations between the operators on each site are

[Lˆ α, Lˆ β ] = i αβγ Lˆ γ , [Lˆ α, nˆβ ] = i αβγ nˆγ ,
[nˆα, nˆβ ] = 0;

(1.21)

the operators with different site labels all commute. The dynamics of each rotor is governed simply by its kinetic energy term; interesting
effects arise from potential energy terms that couple the rotors together, and these will be considered in a moment. Each rotor has the kinetic energy

HK

=

J g˜ Lˆ 2, 2

(1.22)

where 1/J g˜ is the rotor moment of inertia (we have put a tilde over g as we wish to reserve g for a different coupling to be introduced below). The Hamiltonian HK can be readily diagonalized for general values of N by well-known group theoretical methods. We quote the results for the physically important cases of N = 2 and 3. For N = 2 the eigenvalues are

J g˜ 2/2 = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; degeneracy = 2 − δ ,0.

(1.23)

Note that there is a nondegenerate ground state with = 0, while all excited states are two-fold degenerate, corresponding to a left- or right-moving rotor. This spectrum will be important in the mapping to physical models to be discussed in Section 1.4.3. For N = 3, the eigenvalues of HK are

J g˜ ( + 1)/2 = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; degeneracy = 2 + 1,

(1.24)

corresponding to the familiar angular momentum states in three dimensions. These states can be viewed as representing the eigenstates of an even number of antiferromagnetically coupled Heisenberg spins, as discussed more explicitly in Section 1.4.3 and in Chapter 19, where we will see that there is a general and powerful correspondence between quantum antiferromagnets and N = 3 rotors.
We are ready to write down the full quantum rotor Hamiltonian, which will be the focus of intensive study in Parts II and III. We place a single quantum rotor on the sites, i, of a d-dimensional lattice, obeying the Hamiltonian

14

Basic concepts

HR

=

J g˜ 2

Lˆ i2 − J nˆ i · nˆ j .

i

ij

(1.25)

We have augmented the sum of kinetic energies of each site with a coupling, J , between rotor orientations on neighboring sites. This coupling energy is minimized by the simple “magnetically ordered” state in which all the rotors are oriented in the same direction. In contrast, the rotor kinetic energy is minimized when the orientation of the rotor is maximally uncertain (by the uncertainty principle), and so the ﬁrst term in HR prefers a quantum paramagnetic state in which the rotors do not have a deﬁnite orientation (i.e. n = 0). Thus the roles of the two terms in HR closely parallel those of the terms in the Ising model HI . As in Section 1.4.1, for g˜ 1, when the kinetic energy dominates, we expect a quantum paramagnet in which, following (1.11),

0|nˆ i · nˆ j |0 ∼ e−|xi −x j |/ξ .

(1.26)

Similarly, for g˜ 1, when the coupling term dominates, we expect a magnetically ordered state in which, as in (1.14),

lim 0|nˆ i · nˆ j |0
|xi −x j |→∞

= N02.

(1.27)

Finally, we can anticipate a second-order quantum phase transition between the two phases
at g˜ = g˜c, and the behavior of N0 and ξ upon approaching this point will be similar to that in the Ising case. These expectations turn out to be correct for d > 1, but we will see that they need some modiﬁcations for d = 1. In one dimension, we will show that g˜c = 0 for N ≥ 3, and so the ground state is a quantum paramagnetic state for all nonzero g˜. The case N = 2, d = 1 is special: there is a transition at a ﬁnite g˜c, but the divergence of the correlation length does not obey (1.2) and the long-distance behavior of the correlation
function g˜ < g˜c differs from (1.27). This case will not be considered until Section 20.3 in Part IV.

1.4.3 Physical realizations of quantum rotors

We will consider the N = 3 quantum rotors ﬁrst, and expose a simple and important connection between O(3) quantum rotor models and a certain class of “dimerized” antiferromagnets, of which TlCuCl3 is the example we highlighted in Section 1.3. Actually the connection between rotor models and antiferromagnets is far more general than the present discussion may suggest, as we see later in Chapter 19. However, this discussion should enable the reader to gain an intuitive feeling for the physical interpretation of the degrees of freedom of the rotor model.
Consider a dimerized system of “Heisenberg spins” Sˆ 1i and Sˆ 2i , where i now labels a pair of spins (a “dimer”). Their Hamiltonian is

Hd = K Sˆ 1i · Sˆ 2i + J

Sˆ 1i · Sˆ 1 j + Sˆ 2i · Sˆ 2 j .

Sˆα, Sˆβ = i αβγ Sˆγ

(1.29)

(the site index has been dropped above), while spin operators on different sites commute. These commutation relations are the same as those of the Lˆ operators in (1.21). However, there is one crucial difference between the Hilbert spaces of states acted on by the quantum rotors and the Heisenberg spins. For the rotor models we allowed states with arbitrary total angular momentum on each site, as in (1.24), and so there were an inﬁnite number of states on each site. For the present Heisenberg spins, however, we will only allow states with total spin S on each site, and we will permit S to be integer or half-integer. Thus there are precisely 2S + 1 states on each site

|S, m with m = −S . . . S,

(1.30)

and the operator identity

Sˆ 2ni = S(S + 1)

(1.31)

holds for each i and n. In addition to describing TlCuCl3, Hamiltonians like Hd describe spin-ladder compounds in d = 1 [33, 102] and “double layer” antiferromagnets in the family of the high-temperature superconductors in d = 2 [129,322,337,443,444,506,507].
Let us examine the properties of Hd in the limit K J . As a ﬁrst approximation, we can neglect the J couplings entirely, and then Hd splits into decoupled pairs of sites, each with a strong antiferromagnetic coupling K between two spins. The Hamiltonian for each
pair can be diagonalized by noting that S1i and S2i couple into states with total angular momentum 0 ≤ ≤ 2S, and so we obtain the eigenenergies

(K /2)( ( + 1) − 2S(S + 1)), degeneracy 2 + 1.

(1.32)

Note that these energies and degeneracies are in one-to-one correspondence with those of a single quantum rotor in (1.24), apart from the difference that the upper restriction on
being smaller than 2S is absent in the rotor model case. If one is interested primarily in low-energy properties, then it appears reasonable to represent each pair of spins by a quantum rotor.
We have seen that the K /J → ∞ limit of Hd closely resembles the g˜ → ∞ limit of HR. To ﬁrst order in g˜, we can compare the matrix elements of the term proportional to J in HR among the low-lying states, with those of the J term in Hd ; it is not difﬁcult to

16

Basic concepts

see that these matrix elements become equal to each other for an appropriate choice of
couplings: see Exercise 6.1. Therefore we may conclude that the low-energy properties of the two models are closely related for large K /J and g˜. Somewhat different considerations in Chapter 19 will show that the correspondence also applies to the quantum critical point
and to the magnetically ordered phase. The main lesson of the above analysis is that the O(3) quantum rotor model represents
the low-energy properties of quantum antiferromagnets of Heisenberg spins, with each
rotor being an effective representation of a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled spins. The strong-coupling spectra clearly indicate the operator correspondence Lˆ i = Sˆ 1i +Sˆ 2i , and so the rotor angular momentum represents the total angular momentum of the underlying spin system. Examination of matrix elements in the large-S limit shows that nˆ i ∝ Sˆ 1i − Sˆ 2i : the rotor coordinate nˆ i is the antiferromagnetic order parameter of the spin system. Magnetically ordered states of the rotor model with nˆ i = 0, which we will encounter below, are therefore spin states with long-range antiferromagnetic order and have a vanishing total fer-
romagnetic moment. Quantum Heisenberg spin systems with a net ferromagnetic moment
are not modeled by the quantum rotor model (11.1) – these will be studied in Section 19.2
by a different approach. Let us now consider the N = 2 quantum rotors, and introduce their connection to the
superﬂuid–insulator transition of bosons. For N = 2, it is useful to introduce an angular variable θi on each site, so that

ni = (cos θi , sin θi ).

(1.33)

The rotor angular momentum has only one component, which can be represented in the Schrödinger picture as the differential operator

Lˆ i

acting on a wavefunction which depends on all the θi . The rotor Hamiltonian is therefore

(1.35)

which is a form that has appeared in numerous studies in different physical contexts. For g˜ → ∞, the eigenstates of HR are of the form i |mi , where mi is the integer angular momentum quantum number of site i; in the Schrödinger form, these states have the wavefunction exp i i mi θi . Now we interpret mi as the change in occupation number of a boson trapped in a potential which has its minimum at site i. The boson could be an ultracold 87Rb atom, or a Cooper pair in a superconducting quantum dot, as illustrated in
Fig. 1.5. The occupation number is measured with respect to a “background” number of
bosons found in the insulator, and hence mi can take negative values whose absolute value does not exceed this number. In the rotor model, mi can run all the way to −∞, but as in the N = 3 case, we do not expect these additional high-energy states to be important for low-energy physics.
From the wavefunction of these localized boson states, we see that the term propor-
tional to J in (1.35) has the effect of shifting nearest-neighbor pairs of angular momenta

as mi → mi ± 1, m j → m j ∓ 1. In other words, bosons tunnel between sites i and j with matrix element −J . Such a tunneling event becomes more probable when the optical lattice potential is weak (i.e. g˜ is small), and strong tunneling eventually induces a transition to the superﬂuid state where (1.27) is obeyed. We will see later in Chapter 8 why (1.27) implies superﬂuidity of the bosons. More details on the connection between N = 2 quantum rotors and quantum boson models appear in Chapter 9.

Overview

Having introduced our key players, the quantum Ising model (1.7) and the quantum rotor model (1.25), we outline here the general strategy followed in describing their physical properties in Parts II and III. We introduce the idea of a continuum limit, and the classical and quantum ﬁeld theories we will study. We also highlight some key questions in the theory of quantum phase transitions, towards which much of the subsequent discussion is directed.
A central concept which will play a fundamental role in our analysis is the connection between (D > 1)-dimensional classical statistical mechanical models and the d-dimensional quantum Ising and rotor models introduced in Chapter 1, where

D = d + 1.

(2.1)

This mapping is not an exact equivalence in general, but does become quantitatively pre-

cise in the vicinity of continuous phase transitions, as we discuss below. The nature of

this general quantum–classical mapping will be discussed and its limitations and utility

will be highlighted. As we noted at the beginning of Chapter 1, the present quantum–

classical mapping should not be confused with the d-dimensional classical physics of d-

dimensional quantum models in the vicinity of T > 0 phase transitions, as in the shaded

region of Fig. 1.2.

We set the stage by simply writing down the D-dimensional classical statistical mechani-

cal models. For the quantum Ising case (which we often refer to as the N = 1 case, because

the order parameter has a single component), we consider the classical Ising partition func-

where K is a dimensionless coupling that characterizes the “temperature” of the classical

Overview

Our claim is that the above classical partition functions are “equal” (in a sense to be made precise in Part II) to the partition functions of the quantum Ising and rotor models of Chapter 1:

Z ∼ Tr exp − HI,R . kBT

(2.4)

It is important to note that the temperature, T , of the quantum models has no connection to the inverse temperature, K , of the classical models. Instead, as we will see, K determines the value of the dimensionless coupling g in the quantum Ising and rotor models.
Before we can explain the “classical” interpretation of T , we need to describe the quantum–classical mapping more precisely. We will show in Part II how the quantum partition function in (2.4) can be written in a Feynman “sum-over-histories.” In this picture, we evolve the quantum states forward in imaginary time, τ , using the Heisenberg imaginarytime evolution operator, exp(−HI,Rτ ). We then see that it is useful to take a spacetime point of view, in which τ is viewed as another dimension, along with the d spacetime dimensions. In this manner, we obtain a partition function which is to be evaluated in D spacetime dimensions, which will turn out to be the models in (2.2) and (2.3). This connection is illustrated in Fig. 2.1.
Now we see from (2.4) that the quantum partition function is equivalent to an imaginary time evolution over a length Lτ , given by

Lτ = kBT

(2.5)

(momentarily inserting factors of and kB). Thus the temperature T in the quantum model HI,R maps to a ﬁnite size in the classical models (2.2) and (2.3). Because the quantum trace in (2.4) involves the same initial and ﬁnal traces, periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the classical model along the τ direction. More formally stated, a quantum model deﬁned on a d-dimensional space Rd maps onto a classical model on Rd × S1, where the circle S1 has circumference Lτ . In particular, the classical model in inﬁnite D-dimensional spacetime maps onto a quantum model at zero temperature.
The above discussion gives a qualitative and intuitive picture of the mapping, but it is not numerically precise, as it glossed over the limit of temporal lattice spacing a → 0 we will

The total length of the time coordinate is Lτ = /(kBT), and periodic boundary conditions are imposed along the time coordinate.

Overview

need to take. As we outline below, and discuss in more detail in Part II, mapping becomes
numerically precise in the vicinity of phase transitions.
The models (2.2) and (2.3) are central to the theory of ﬁnite-temperature phase transi-
tions in classical statistical mechanics. We will review their basic properties in Chapters 3 and 4. For all values of N in D > 2, and for N = 1, 2 in D = 2, these models display a phase transition between a low “temperature” magnetically ordered phase for K > Kc and a high “temperature” disordered phase for K < Kc. These phases are characterized by correlations of the order parameter σ z, n in a manner closely analogous to the magnetically ordered and quantum paramagnetic phases of Chapter 1. So in the K < Kc disordered phase we have, as in (1.26),

nˆ i · nˆ j ∼ e−|xi −x j |/ξ ,

(2.6)

for large |xi − x j |, where the average is with respect to the classical partition function (3.2) and xi is a D-dimensional coordinate. Similarly, for K > Kc we have, in (1.27),

lim
|xi −x j |→∞

0|nˆ i

·

nˆ j |0

= N02,

(2.7)

where N0 is the spontaneous magnetization (this does not apply to the special case D = 2, N = 1, where the behavior for K > Kc will be discussed in Section 20.3). Similar results hold for the N = 1 case with the variable σ z. Upon approaching Kc, N0 vanishes as a power law, and ξ diverges as

ξ −1 ∼ a|K − Kc|ν ,

(2.8)

with ν a critical exponent. Again, an exception to this is the case N = 2, D = 2 where the

divergence of ξ has a different form. Also for the cases N > 2, D = 2 there is no phase

transition at any ﬁnite K , but there is a diverging correlation length for K → ∞, and most

of the considerations below apply to these cases as well.

An important consequence of the divergence of the correlation lengths (2.8) and (1.2)

near the phase transition in both the classical and quantum models is that of universality.

This is the claim that most microscopic details of the lattice models do not modify the

essential structure of the corrections in the critical region at length scales of order ξ . With

ξ a, a lattice spacing, it seems reasonable that ﬂuctuations of individual spins on the

lattice scale do not matter in their details, and some “renormalized” theory is important at

scales ξ and larger. This argument can also be made using energy scales of the quantum

model, in which case the requirement of universality is that

J . We provide a speciﬁc

justiﬁcation of the hypothesis of universality using the renormalization group in Chapter 4.

We can now make a more precise statement of quantum–classical mapping. The uni-

versal properties of the d-dimensional quantum Ising and rotor models in their region of

large correlation length are identical to those of the D-dimensional classical models (2.2)

and (2.3). Further, correlators of the classical model in D dimensions map onto imagi-

nary time correlators of the d-dimensional quantum model, where one of the classical D

dimensions behaves like the quantum imaginary time direction, and the remaining D − 1

classical directions map onto the d spatial directions of the quantum model. The mapping

has an immediate consequence: as the quantum imaginary time direction is simply one of

21

2.1 Quantum ﬁeld theories

the spatial directions of the classical model, we compare (2.8) with (1.1) and (1.2) and conclude that we must have the dynamic exponent z = 1 for the quantum Ising/rotor models.
Having identiﬁed the appropriate universal limit of the quantum models, it is appropriate to ask: what is the quantum theory that describes these universal properties? These turn out to be continuum quantum ﬁeld theories, which are introduced in the following section.

2.1 Quantum ﬁeld theories

The following discussion will be carried out in the language of the quantum Ising and rotor

models. However, essentially the same arguments can also be made for the classical models (2.2) and (2.3), as we will see in Chapters 3 and 4.
Let us consider the regime where |g − gc| is small, so that

J and ξ −1

.

(2.9)

Suppose, further, that we are observing the system at a temperature T , a length scale x, and a frequency scale ω, and all of these are of the order of the temperature, length, and energy scales that can be created out of , ξ , and the fundamental constants. We will then be particularly interested in dynamic response functions of the system near a quantum critical point in the limit where the inequalities (2.9) are well satisﬁed. From a particle theorist’s perspective, this means we are taking the limits → ∞ and J → ∞ while keeping , ξ , x, ω, and T ﬁxed. In terms of dimensionless parameters, this means we are sending ξ → ∞ and J/ → ∞, while keeping ω/ , x/ξ , and kB T / ﬁxed. A glance at (1.1) and (1.2) shows that these limits can only be taken while tuning g to become progressively closer to gc. The complementary condensed matter theorist’s perspective is that we are keeping and J ﬁxed and looking at the system’s response at small , large ξ , and at long distances and times and low temperatures; the two approaches are clearly equivalent as the limits of the dimensionless ratios are the same. The resulting response functions can be considered to be correlators of a quantum ﬁeld theory, which is now associated with a Hamiltonian deﬁned in the continuum and has no intrinsic shortdistance or high-energy cutoff. A quantum ﬁeld theory shares many of the characteristics of ordinary quantum mechanics, with a unitary time evolution operator deﬁned by the continuum Hamiltonian, except that it has an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume.
The physical utility of the quantum ﬁeld theory relies mainly on its universality. As we have sent → ∞ and J → ∞, it appears plausible that changes in the structure of H (g) at the lattice scale will not modify the nature of the quantum ﬁeld theory that eventually appears, and the only consequence is a change in the values of the dimensionful parameters
and ξ (this change results from modiﬁcations of the prefactors in (1.1) and (1.2), which, as we have already asserted, are nonuniversal). A general rule of thumb is that only essential qualitative features, such as the symmetry of the order parameter, the dimensionality of space, and constraints placed by conservation laws, survive the continuum limit, and the structure of the quantum ﬁeld theory is severely constrained by these restrictions.

22

Overview

We have argued above that every second-order quantum phase transition deﬁnes a quantum ﬁeld theory in the continuum. Our attack on the quantum phase transition problem in this book can be considered as consisting of two essential steps. First, we understand and classify the various quantum ﬁeld theories that can arise out of quantum phase transitions in lattice Hamiltonians of physical interest. And second, we describe the dynamical properties of these quantum ﬁeld theories at ﬁnite temperatures. The latter will then model the universal properties of the physical lattice Hamiltonians in the vicinity of the quantum critical point.
We can now answer the basic question: what are the quantum ﬁeld theories associated with the second-order quantum phase transitions in the quantum rotor model HR in (1.25) and the quantum Ising model HI in (1.7)? It is possible to give a common treatment of HI and HR, with HI simply being the N = 1 case of a general discussion for HR. We attempt to write down a Feynman path integral for the quantum partition function (2.4). As we argued earlier, this is expressed in terms of a functional integral over all possible time histories (the “sum over histories” formulation of quantum mechanics) of the rotor coordinate ni (τ ) over an imaginary time 0 ≤ τ ≤ /kB T (and similarly for σiz for N = 1). Clearly, this time axis is the (d + 1)th dimension of the corresponding classical model. The ﬁnal quantum ﬁeld theory is conveniently expressed in terms of a coarse-grained ﬁeld φα(x, τ ) deﬁned by

φα(x, τ ) ∼

niα(τ ),

i∈N (x)

(2.10)

where x is a point in d-dimensional space, N (x) is a coarse-graining neighborhood of x,
the index α = 1 . . . N , and the overall normalization of φα can be chosen at our convenience. For the case N = 1, we simply replace niα by σiz. Because the ni can point in different directions at each i, the magnitude of φα can vary over a wide range. Indeed, it seems reasonable that instead of applying a “hard” constraint like ni2 = 1, we can view φα as a “soft” spin whose magnitude can vary freely over all positive values. A remnant
of the hard constraint on the microscopic degrees of freedom is that we have a local effective potential V (φα2), which controls ﬂuctuations of φα2 and prevents it from becoming too large. We can also make a polynomial expansion for V , and it turns out to be adequate to truncate it at terms of order (φα2)2. In this manner, the quantum ﬁeld theory obtained by considering the vicinity of the quantum critical points in HR,I is deﬁned by the following imaginary time Feynman path integral over all possible time histories of the ﬁeld φα(x, τ )
for the partition function Z:

where c is a velocity, r and u are coupling constants, and the functional integral is over ﬁelds periodic in τ with period /kB T (i.e. φα(x, τ ) = φα(x, τ + /kB T )). The two

23

2.1 Quantum ﬁeld theories

nongradient terms in (2.11) arise from the polynomial expansion of the potential V (φα2) noted above; the spatial gradient term represents the energy cost for the spatial variations
in the orientation of the magnetic order. The time derivative term arises from the quantummechanical tunneling terms proportional to J g (J g˜) in HI (HR), and we will see how they lead to second-order time derivatives in Chapters 5 and 6. This quantum ﬁeld theory undergoes a quantum phase transition, from a phase with φα = 0 to one with φα = 0, by tuning the coupling r through a critical value rc at T = 0.
An alternative formulation of this quantum ﬁeld theory is sometimes useful for analyzing HR at small g˜ and for low values of d; this formulation applies only for N ≥ 2 and yields a ﬁeld theory with precisely the same universal properties as the formulation in (2.11). The basic idea is that at small g˜, the predominant ﬂuctuations will be variations in the orientation of the local direction of ni . Also, the orientation should not vary signiﬁcantly from site to site, and we can therefore simply promote ni (τ ) to a unit-length continuum ﬁeld n(x, τ ) and obtain

(2.12)

where the small g˜ expressions for g and c are given in (6.11) and (6.51), and n(x, τ ) satisﬁes a periodicity condition similar to that for φα. This ﬁeld theory is often called the O(N ) quantum nonlinear sigma model in d dimensions, for obscure historical reasons. The action is only quadratic in the ﬁeld n(x, τ ), but the model is not a free ﬁeld theory because of the constraint n2(x, τ ) = 1 imposed at each point in spacetime. Note also that (2.12) is the obvious higher dimensional generalization of the D = 1 ﬁeld theory (6.45) studied in Chapter 3: instead of having only one “quantum” τ direction, we also have d additional spatial directions labeled by x, along with the corresponding gradient squared term in the action.
We note one important property of the quantum ﬁeld theories (2.11) and (2.12), which will not generalize to some of the other quantum phase transitions studied in Part IV. These ﬁeld theories are clearly invariant under “relativistic” transformations in spacetime, with the velocity c playing the role of the velocity of light. Consequently spatial and temporal scales must behave equivalently near the quantum critical point; this implies that the dynamic critical exponent must be z = 1, a value which is implicitly assumed in some of the discussion in Parts II and III. Our discussion of transitions with z = 1 is deferred to Part IV.
The description of the universal dynamical properties of (2.11) and (2.12) will occupy a substantial portion of Part III. Formally, the imaginary time correlations of an inﬁnite d-dimensional quantum system at a temperature T are simply related to the correlations of a D-dimensional classical system that is inﬁnite in d directions and of ﬁnite extent Lτ in one direction.

24

Overview

2.2 What’s different about quantum transitions?
The quantum–classical mapping discussed so far in Part I is in fact a very general result and not a speciﬁc property of the Ising/rotor models. One can always reinterpret the imaginary time functional integral of a d-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory as the ﬁnite “temperature” Gibbs ensemble of a D-dimensional classical ﬁeld theory. We will often use this mapping between d-dimensional quantum mechanics and D-dimensional classical statistical mechanics, and we will refer to it as the QC mapping. However, in general, the resulting classical statistical mechanics problem will not be as simple as it was for the Ising/rotor models. Quantum critical points often have z = 1, and so correlators of the classical problem will scale differently along the x and τ directions. Furthermore, as we note below, there is no guarantee that the Gibbs weights are positive, and they could even be complex valued.
Given this simple, and ubiquitous, quantum–classical mapping QC, one can now legitimately raise the question: why does one need a separate theory of quantum phase transitions? Is it not possible to simply lift results from the corresponding classical theory and obtain all needed properties of the quantum system? The answer to the second question is an emphatic “no,” and a direct treatment of the quantum problems is certainly needed. The reasons for this should become clearer to the reader on proceeding through the book, but we note some important points here:
• Note that the quantum–classical mapping QC yields quantum correlation functions that are in imaginary time. The most interesting properties of the quantum critical point are often related to their real-time dynamics (e.g. their energy spectra, inelastic neutron scattering cross-sections, or relaxation rates as measured in NMR experiments). To obtain these, one needs to analytically continue the imaginary time results to real time. The crucial point is that this analytic continuation is an ill-posed problem; that is, it is possible to continue exact imaginary time results to real time, but anything short of an exact result leads to unreliable, and usually unphysical, results. In particular, existing analytic results in the theory of classical critical phenomena (with the exception of a single exact result in two spatial dimensions that we shall consider in Chapter 10) are totally inadequate for obtaining T > 0 dynamic properties of the corresponding quantum critical points; approximation schemes which work in imaginary time usually fail after analytic continuation to real time, i.e. the operations of expanding in a control parameter, and analytic continuation, do not commute. The problem is particularly severe for the long time limit t /kB T , which is usually of the greatest practical interest. These correlations are essentially impossible to reconstruct from the equivalent classical problem, which only yields imaginary time correlations in the domain 0 ≤ τ ≤ /kB T . It is therefore of crucial importance that the theory be constructed using the physical concepts of the quantum critical point and that it formulate the dynamic analysis directly in real time at all stages.
• We will see in the following chapters that a fundamental new time scale characterizing the dynamic properties of systems near a quantum critical point is the phase coherence

25

2.2 What’s different about quantum transitions?

time, τϕ. Loosely speaking, τϕ is the time over which the wavefunction of the many-body system retains memory of its phase. Local measurements separated by times shorter than τϕ will display quantum interference effects. Precise deﬁnitions of τϕ have to be tailored to the physical situation at hand, and these will be presented later for the models and regimes considered. In most cases τϕ is closely related to the thermal equilibration time, τeq, discussed in Section 1.2. The phase coherence time has no analog near the corresponding classical critical point in D dimensions. Note from (2.5) that an inﬁnite Ddimensional classical system maps onto a d-dimensional quantum system at T = 0; in all the models we shall consider in this book, the latter will have either a unique ground state or one with a degeneracy small enough that the entropy is not thermodynamically signiﬁcant: under these circumstances we can expect that it is always possible to deﬁne a τϕ that is inﬁnite at T = 0, and therefore the quantum system has perfect phase coherence at sufﬁciently low temperatures. From the inﬁnite D-dimensional classical point of view, however, this result may seem extremely peculiar. Most such systems have a high“temperature” disordered phase in which there is no long-range order and all correlations decay exponentially over very short scales. Yet we are claiming that such a disordered state maps onto a corresponding “quantum-disordered” state, which is characterized by correlations that have an inﬁnite correlation time (there is also a long length scale, the distance excitations can travel in a time τϕ – for related remarks from experimentalists’ perspectives, the reader should see the articles by Mason et al. [320] and Aeppli et al. [4]); for this reason we shall eschew the commonly used “quantum-disordered” appellation and refer to this state, as noted earlier, as a quantum paramagnet. This peculiarity is closely related to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation noted above. Quantum systems at T = 0 really do have a genuinely different long-range phase correlation in time that is almost completely hidden once the mapping to imaginary time and the corresponding classical system has been performed. Only for T > 0 does the τϕ of the quantum system become ﬁnite. An important purpose of this book is to show how to introduce a characterization of quantum states that demonstrates the perfect coherence at T = 0, to show how to compute τϕ for T > 0, and to highlight the crucial role played by τϕ in the structure of the dynamic correlations. The manner in which τϕ → ∞ as T → 0 is an important diagnostic in characterizing the different T > 0 regions in the vicinity of the quantum critical point. We shall ﬁnd that, in all of the models we study, the time Lτ in (2.5) appears as a lower bound on the rate of divergence of τϕ as T → 0, that is,

where C is a number of order unity. Our estimates of τeq in Section 1.2 are clearly consistent with (2.13). In the quantum critical region of Fig. 1.3, the inequality in (2.13) is
saturated; this region will be of particular interest to us. Its dynamical properties have
not been studied until recently, and we will ﬁnd that they have many remarkably universal characteristics even though their saturating the lower bound on τϕ implies that their physics is maximally incoherent. Because of this shortest possible τϕ, the quantum critical region realizes a “nearly perfect” ﬂuid, as we will discuss brieﬂy in Section 15.5.

Overview

• For a large class of interesting, physically relevant quantum critical points, the corresponding classical critical points are rather artiﬁcial and not of a class that have been studied earlier. In random systems, the classical problems have disorder that is inﬁnitely correlated along the imaginary time direction. Moreover, even in nonrandom systems, the classical problems often have complex-valued Boltzmann weights. These complex weights are clearly a consequence of the underlying quantum mechanics and are often best understood as “Berry phase” factors (see [464] for an elementary introduction to Berry phases; the Berry phases are complex even in imaginary time). We will study quantum critical points of these types in Part IV of this book. We will see that this leads to a whole new class of phenomena, which have no analogs in the classical theory.
• Even for those quantum critical points that do have well-studied classical analogs, note that we need the classical correlation functions in a rather curious slab geometry: one which is inﬁnite in D − 1 dimensions and of ﬁnite length Lτ in one direction. There are very few existing results in such a geometry, and one often has to reconstruct the needed correlators from scratch.
Despite these caveats, it should be evident that it will pay to push the quantum–classical mapping QC as far as possible, for this will allow us to get maximum mileage from the sophisticated and profound developments in the theory of classical critical phenomena. This is the strategy of this book. We begin in Parts II and III by thoroughly examining a class of quantum phase transitions that do have simple and well-studied classical analogs. In this manner, we will introduce many of the central concepts needed in a somewhat more familiar environment. Then, as noted above, we will proceed in Part IV to many other physically important quantum phase transitions that involve Berry phases in a crucial way, but which do not have useful classical analogs.
There have also been discussions of the dynamical properties of quantum ﬁeld theories at ﬁnite temperature in particle physics literature [50, 247, 259, 381]. However, these are exclusively concerned with physics in D = 4 in models that do not satisfy “hyperscaling” [59] properties, and this leads to signiﬁcant differences from the systems we shall examine here. Some of these studies [50, 247] have examined the model Sφ in (2.11) for the case D = 4, N = 1, which turns out to be essentially a free ﬁeld theory at low energies. As a result, inelastic decoherence effects are rather weak and nonuniversal. This will be discussed further in Chapter 14. There is also interest in the high-temperature dynamical properties of non-Abelian gauge theories [247, 381]. These are asymptotically free at high energies (i.e. scattering between the elementary excitations is negligibly small at high energies), and as a result the high-temperature behavior is controlled by a Gaussian and classical ﬁxed point. We will see an analogous phenomenon here in a much simpler context in Section 12.3; the simplicity will allow us to make greater progress than has so far been possible for the gauge theories. The models of primary interest in this book satisfy hyperscaling and are not asymptotically free at high energies; such models have not been studied in particle physics literature.

Classical phase transitions

Given the motivation outlined in Chapter 2, we begin by discussing phase transitions in the context of classical statistical mechanics. This is a vast subject, and the reader can ﬁnd many other books which explore many subtle issues. Here, our purpose is to summarize the main ideas which transfer easily to our subsequent discussions of quantum phase transitions.
We will consider the most important models of classical phase transitions: ferromagnets with N component spins residing on the sites, i, of a hypercubic lattice. For N = 1, this is the familiar Ising model with a partition function already met in (2.2):

Z=

Note that we have refrained from inserting an explicit factor of temperature above, as

the symbol T will be reserved for the temperature of the quantum systems we consider

later. As is discussed in introductory statistical mechanics texts, this Ising model describes the vicinity of the liquid–gas critical point, with the average value σiz measuring the density in the vicinity of site i. It can also model loss of ferromagnetism with increasing

temperature in magnets in which the electronic spins preferentially align along a particular

crystalline axis: this “easy-axis” behavior can be induced by the spin–orbit interaction. For

N > f 1, we generalize (3.1) to the model of (2.3)

(3.2)

The N = 3 case (known as the “Heisenberg” model) describes ferromagnetism in materials with sufﬁciently weak, small spin–orbit couplings, so that the spins can freely orient along any direction. The N = 2 case (known as the “XY” model) describes the superﬂuid–normal transition in liquid helium and other superﬂuids, as we will see in Section 8.3.
The observables, O, of the classical models will be arbitrary functions of the ni , and we are interested in their expectation values deﬁned by

for N = 1, and similarly for N ≥ 1.

Classical phase transitions

As discussed in Chapter 2, the models in (3.1) and (3.2) undergo phase transitions at some critical K = Kc. We are interested in describing the nature of the spin correlations in the vicinity of this critical point, and especially their universal aspects. We begin in Section 3.1 by describing this transition using a variational method which leads to a “meanﬁeld” theory. A more general formulation of the mean-ﬁeld results appears in the framework of Landau theory in Section 3.2, which allows easy treatment of spatial variations. Finally, corrections to Landau theory are considered in Section 3.3.

3.1 Mean-ﬁeld theory

First, we give a heuristic derivation of mean-ﬁeld theory. Here, and below, for notational

simplicity we will focus on the N = 1 Ising case, although the generalization to N > 1 is

not difﬁcult.

We focus on the ﬂuctuations of a particular spin σiz. This spin feels the local Hamiltonian

(3.4)

The mean-ﬁeld approximation is in the center, where we replace all the neighboring spins by their average value. Here N0 is the ferromagnetic moment, deﬁned by

N0 ≡ σiz

(3.5)

in the full theory, where the translational invariance of H guarantees the independence of

N0 on the site i. Given the simple effective Hamiltonian for site i in Eq. (3.4), we can now evaluate

σiz =

σiz=±1 σiz exp 2D K N0σiz σiz=±1 exp 2D K N0σiz

= tanh(2D K N0).

(3.6)

Combining (3.5) and (3.6), we have our central mean-ﬁeld equation

N0 = tanh(2D K N0)

(3.7)

for the value of N0. We will discuss the nature of its solutions shortly. Let us now give a more formal derivation of (3.7) using the variational method. This
method relies on the choice of an arbitrary mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian, HM F . Naturally, we want to choose HM F so that we are able to easily evaluate its partition function ZM F , and the expectation values of all the observables, which we denote O M F after evaluation as in (3.3) but with H replaced by HM F . We now want to optimize the choice of HM F by a variational principle which bounds the exact free energy F = − ln Z. Of course, the best possible choice is HM F = H , but this does not allow easy evaluation of correlations. The variational principle descends from the theorem

F ≤ FMF + H − HMF MF .

(3.8)

31

3.1 Mean-ﬁeld theory

The proof of the theorem proceeds as follows (here, and below, we use the symbol “Tr” to denote the sum over all the σiz):

e−F = Tre−H

= Tre−(H −HM F )−HM F

= e−FM F e−(H −HM F )

.

MF

(3.9)

We now use the statement of the convexity of the exponential function, which is

e−O ≥ e− O .

(3.10)

Taking logarithms of both sides of (3.9), we ﬁnally obtain (3.8). Returning to the Ising model, we choose the simplest HM F consisting of a set of decou-
pled spins in a “mean ﬁeld” h M F :

HM F = −h M F σiz.
i

(3.11)

Then, we see immediately that

FM F = −M ln(2 cosh h M F ),

(3.12)

where M is the total number of sites on the lattice, and

N0 =

MF

= − 1 ∂FMF M ∂hMF

= tanh(h M F ).

Using (3.8) to bound the free energy, we have

F ≤ FMF − K

(3.14)

We now have upper bounds for the free energy for every value of the, so far, undeter-
mined parameter h M F . Clearly we want to choose h M F to minimize the right hand side of (3.14); we will declare the resulting upper bound as our approximate result for F – this is the mean-ﬁeld approximation. Actually, it is helpful to trade the variational parameter h M F with the value of the ferromagnetic moment N0, as they are related to each other by (3.13). So our variational parameter is now N0, and our mean-ﬁeld free energy is a function of N0 given by

F (N0)/M = FM F (N0)/M − K D N02 + N0h M F (N0),

(3.15)

where the functions FM F (N0) and h M F (N0) are deﬁned by (3.12) and (3.13). Using these expressions, we obtain the explicit expression

which can be interpreted as the sum of estimates of the internal energy and entropy of the Ising spins (see Exercise 3.1). Our task is now to minimize (3.16) over values of N0 for each K . Before examining the results of this, let us examine the nature of the stationarity condition by taking the derivative of (3.15):

1 M

∂F ∂ N0

=

1 M

∂F ∂hMF

∂hMF ∂ N0

− 2K D N0 + hM F

+

N0

(3.17)

Using (3.13) we observe that the ﬁrst and last terms cancel, and so the stationarity condition is simply h M F = 2K D N0, which is ﬁnally equivalent to our earlier heuristic result in (3.7).
Rather than solving (3.7), it is more instructive to examine the solution by plotting (3.16)
as a function of N0 for different K . This is shown in Fig. 3.1. We notice a qualitative change in the nature of the minimization at K = Kc = 1/(2D). For K < Kc (high temperatures) the free energy is minimized by N0 = 0: this corresponds to the high-temperature “paramagnetic” phase. However, for K > Kc we have two degenerate minima at nonzero values of N0 which have the same magnitude but opposite signs. The system will “spontaneously” choose one of these equivalent minima, leading to ferromagnetic order. Note
that this choice is not invariant under the spin–ﬂip symmetry of the underlying H , and so
this is a simple illustration of the phenomenon of “spontaneous symmetry breaking.” The critical point K = Kc is the position of the phase transition between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases.

33

3.2 Landau theory

3.2 Landau theory

The main idea of mean-ﬁeld theory has been to represent the 2M degrees of freedom in
the Ising model by a single mean magnetization, N0. The free energy is determined as a function of N0, and then minimized to obtain the optimal equilibrium state.
Landau theory retains the idea of free energy optimization, but generalizes N0 to a continuum ﬁeld φα(x). Here α = 1 . . . N , and x is a D-dimensional coordinate associated with a hypercubic lattice of spacing a. We have now returned to a consideration of the theory for general N . The central actor in Landau theory will be a free energy functional, F[φα(x)], which has to be minimized with respect to variations in φα(x).
For now, we will keep the deﬁnition of φα(x) somewhat imprecise. Physically, φα(x) represents a coarse-grained average of the local magnetization niα in the vicinity of x = xi , as we discussed in (2.10) for the corresponding quantum model

φα(x) ∼

niα.

i∈N (x)

(3.18)

As discussed in the text following (2.10), we view φα as a “soft” spin whose magnitude can vary freely over all positive values.
The Landau free energy functional F[φα(x)] is now derived from a few basic principles:

• The Hamiltonian is invariant under a common O(N ) rotation, niα → Rαβ niβ , where Rαβ is a rotation matrix applied to all sites i. So the free energy should also be invariant under global rotations of the φα. We saw an example of this for N = 1: then the only symmetry is σiz → −σiz, and consequently, (3.16) is an even function of N0.
• Near the critical point at K = Kc, the average value N0 was smaller than the natural value |σiz| = 1. We expect this to hold also for N > 1. After the coarse-graining in (3.18), we expect that φα is small in a similar sense. Our main interest is in the vicinity of Kc, and therefore the Landau functional will be expanded in powers of φα.
• A key step by which Landau theory improves mean-ﬁeld theory is that it allows for
spatial variations in the local magnetic order. We will assume here that the important
spatial variations occur on a scale which is much larger than a lattice spacing. This
assumption will be seen to be valid later, provided we are close to the critical point
K = Kc. With this assumption, we will be able to expand the free energy functional in gradients of φα.

We are now prepared to write down the important terms in F[φα(x)]. Expanding in powers and gradients of φα(x) we have

F=

dDx

1 2

K(∇x φα)2 + r φα2(x)

+

u 4!

φα2(x) 2 ,

(3.19)

expressed in terms of the parameters K, r , u. We may regard these as unknown phenomenological parameters that have to be determined by ﬁtting to experimental or numerical data. However, we can obtain initial estimates by matching to the results on mean-ﬁeld theory in

34

Classical phase transitions

Section 3.1. First, we set the overall normalization of φα by setting its average value equal to that of the niα:

φα(xi ) = niα .

(3.20)

Then comparing (3.19) with the expansion of (3.16) to quartic order, we obtain for N = 1

r = a−D(1 − 2D K ), u = 2a−D.

(3.21)

Of course, this method does not yield the value of K, because mean-ﬁeld theory does not
have any spatial variations. To estimate K we may examine the energy of a domain wall at low temperatures between two oppositely oriented ferromagnetic domains with σiz = ± 1. Such a domain wall has energy 2K per unit length; computing the domain wall energy using (3.19), we obtain the estimate K ≈ 2K a2−D.
An interesting feature of (3.21) is that r = 0 at K = Kc. In fact, we expect quite generally that r ∼ Kc − K , as a simple argument now shows. The optimum value of φα(x) under (3.19) is clearly given by a space-independent solution (provided K > 0). For r > 0 (and
assuming that u > 0 generally), the minimum of F is obtained by φα(x) = 0. This is clearly the paramagnetic phase. In contrast, for r < 0, it will pay to choose a space-independent
but nonzero φα. The O(N ) invariance of F guarantees that there is a degenerate set of minima that map onto each other under O(N ) rotations. So let us orient φα along the α = 1
axis, and write

φα = δα,1 N0.

(3.22)

Inserting this into (3.19) and minimizing for r < 0 we obtain

N0 =

−6r . u

(3.23)

This shows that N0 vanishes as r 0, and the approach to the critical point allows us to introduce the critical exponent β deﬁned by

N0 ∼ (−r )β .

(3.24)

Both mean-ﬁeld and Landau theory predict that β = 1/2, as can also be veriﬁed by a minimization of the full expression in (3.16). Related analyses of other observables allow us to obtain other critical exponents, as we explore in Exercise 3.4.

3.3 Fluctuations and perturbation theory

We now want to proceed beyond the mean-ﬁeld treatment of the phase transition at K = Kc. We expect that the value of Kc will have corrections to its mean-ﬁeld value of 1/(2D): we will not focus on these here because they are nonuniversal, i.e. dependent upon speciﬁc
details of the microscopic Hamiltonian. Rather, our focus will be on universal quantities like the critical exponent β. The structure of Landau theory already suggests reasons why β may be universal: notice that the value of β depended only on the quartic polynomial

35

3.3 Fluctuations and perturbation theory

structure of the free energy, which in turn followed from symmetry considerations. Modifying the form of H , e.g. by adding second-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, would not change the arguments leading to the Landau free energy functional, and we would still obtain β = 1/2 although Kc would change.
Indeed, the universality suggested by Landau theory is too strong. It indicates that any ferromagnet with O(N ) symmetry always has β = 1/2. We now see that there are ﬂuctuation corrections to Landau theory, and that the universal quantities depend not only on symmetry, but also on the dimensionality, D. The Landau theory predictions are correct for D > 4, while there are corrections for D ≤ 4. We will need the renormalization group approach to compute universal quantities for D < 4, and this is described in Chapter 4.
One way to address ﬂuctuation corrections is to return to the underlying partition function in (3.1), and expand it as a power series in K or in 1/K . Such series expansions have been carried out to very high orders, and they are efﬁcient and accurate methods for describing the behavior at high and low temperatures. However, they are not directly suited for addressing the vicinity of the critical point K = Kc. Instead, we would like to use a method which builds on the success of Landau theory, and yields its results at leading order. The coarse-graining arguments associated with (3.18) suggest a route to achieving this: rather than summing over all the individual spins in (3.1), we should integrate over all values of the collective ﬁeld variable φα(x). In other words, we should regard the expression in (3.19) not as the free energy functional, but as the Hamiltonian (or “action”) of a classical statistical mechanics problem in which the degrees of freedom are represented by the ﬁeld φα(x). The partition function is therefore represented by the functional integral

Z = Dφα(x) exp(−Sφ),

Sφ =

dDx

1 2

(∇x φα)2 + r φα2(x)

+u 4!

φα2(x) 2 .

(3.25)

Here the symbol Dφα(x) represents an inﬁnite dimensional integral over the values of the ﬁeld φα(x) at every spatial point x. Whenever in doubt, we will interpret this somewhat vague mathematical deﬁnition by discretizing x to a set of lattice points of small spacing ∼1/ . Equivalently, we will Fourier transform φα(x) to φα(k), and impose a cutoff |k| < in the set of allowed wavevectors.
We have set the coefﬁcient of the gradient term K equal to unity in (3.25). This is to avoid clutter of notation, and is easily accomplished by an appropriate rescaling of the ﬁeld φα and the spatial coordinates.
An immediate advantage of the representation in (3.25) is that Landau theory is obtained simply by making the saddle-point approximation to the functional integral. We can also see that, as described in more detail below, systematic corrections to Landau theory appear in an expansion in powers of the quartic coupling u. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to explaining how to compute the terms in the u expansion. Each term has an efﬁcient representation in terms of “Feynman diagrams,” from which an analytic expression can also be obtained.

3.3.1 Gaussian integrals

We introduce the technology of Feynman diagrams in the simplest possible setting. Let us

discretize space, and write the φα(xi ) variables as yi ; we drop the α label to avoid clutter

of indices. Then consider the multidimensional integral

(3.26)

where the off-diagonal terms in the matrix A arise from the spatial gradient terms in Sφ.

In this section, we consider A to be an arbitrary positive deﬁnite, symmetric matrix. The

positive deﬁniteness requires that r > 0, i.e. K < Kc. Also, we have deﬁned

Dy =

∞ √d yi ,

i −∞ 2π

(3.27)

and are interested in the expansion of Z(u) in powers of u. Thinking of (3.26) as a statistical mechanics ensemble, we will also be interested in the power series expansion of correlators like

(3.28)

First, we note the exact expressions for these quantities at u = 0. The partition function is

Z(0) = (det A)−1/2.

(3.29)

This result is most easily obtained by performing an orthogonal rotation of the yi to a

basis which diagonalizes the matrix Ai j before performing the integral (Exercise 3.5). Also

useful for the u expansion is the identity

which is obtained by shifting the yi variables to complete the square in the argument of the exponential. By taking derivatives of this identity with respect to the Ji , and then setting Ji = 0, we can generate expressions of all the correlators at u = 0. In particular, the twopoint correlator is

Ci j (0) = Ai−j1.

(3.31)

For the 2n-point correlator, we have an expression known as Wick’s theorem:

where the summation over P represents the sum over all possible products of pairs, and we reiterate that both sides of the equation are evaluated at u = 0. Thus for the 4-point correlator, we have

yi y j yk y = yi y j yk y + yi yk y j y + yi y y j yk .

(3.33)

There is a natural diagrammatic representation of the right-hand side of (3.33): we represent each distinct ﬁeld yi by a dot, and then draw a line between dots i and j to represent each factor of Ci j (0) see Fig. 3.2.
We can now generate the needed expansions of Z(u) and Ci j (u) simply by expanding the integrands in powers of u, and evaluating the resulting series term by term using Wick’s theorem. What follows is simply a set of very useful diagrammatic rules for efﬁciently obtaining the answer at each order. However, whenever in doubt about the value of a diagram, it is often easiest to go back to this primary deﬁnition.
For Z(u), expanding to order u2, we obtain the diagrams shown in Fig. 3.3 which evaluate to the expression

Now, note an important feature of (3.35): the terms here correspond precisely to the subset of the terms in Fig. 3.3 associated with the connected diagrams. These are diagrams in which all points are connected to each other by at least one line, and this result is an

example of the “linked cluster theorem.” We will not prove this very useful result here: at all orders in u, we can obtain the perturbation theory for the free energy by keeping only the connected diagrams in the expansion of the partition function.
Now let us consider the u expansion of the two-point correlator, Ci j (u), in (3.28). Here, we have to expand the numerator and denominator in (3.28) in powers of u, evaluate each term using Wick’s theorem, and then divide the result series. Fortunately, the linked cluster theorem simpliﬁes things a great deal here too. The result of the division is simply to cancel all the disconnected diagrams. Thus, we need only expand the numerator, and keep only connected diagrams. The diagrams are shown in Fig. 3.4 to order u2, and they evaluate to

(3.36)

We now state the useful Dyson’s theorem. For this, it is helpful to consider the expansion of the inverse of the Ci j matrix, and write it as

Ci−j 1 = Ai j − i j ,

(3.37)

where the matrix i j is called the “self-energy,” for historical reasons not appropriate here. Using (3.36), some algebra shows that to order u2

and these are shown graphically in Fig. 3.5. Dyson’s theorem states that we can obtain the expression for the i j directly from the graphs for Ci j in Fig. 3.4 by two modiﬁcations: (i) drop the factors of A−1 associated with external lines, and (ii) keep only the graphs which are one-particle irreducible (1PI). The latter are graphs which do not break into disconnected pieces when one internal line is cut; the last graph in Fig. 3.4 is one-particle reducible, and so does not appear in (3.38) and Fig. 3.5.
The expression in (3.38) will be the basis for much of the analysis in Part II.

3.3.2 Expansion for susceptibility

We now apply the results of Section 3.3.1 to our functional integral representation in (3.25) for the vicinity of the phase transition.
The problem deﬁned by (3.25) has an important simplifying feature not shared by our general analysis of (3.26): translational invariance. This means that correlators depend only upon the differences of spatial coordinates, and that the analog of the matrix A can be diagonalized by a Fourier tranformation. So now we deﬁne the correlator

Cαβ (x − y) = φα(x)φβ (y) − φα(x) φβ (y) ,

(3.39)

where the subtraction allows generalization to the ferromagnetic phase; we will consider only the paramagnetic phase here.
The subtraction in (3.39) is also needed for the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem. We will discuss the full version of this theorem in Section 7.1, but note a simpler version. We consider the susceptibility, χαβ , the response of the system to an applied “magnetic” ﬁeld hα, under which the action changes as

Sφ → Sφ − d D x hα(x)φα(x).

(3.40)

Then

χαβ (x

−

y)

=

δ φα(x) δhβ(y)

= Cαβ (x − y),

(3.41)

where the last equality follows from taking the derivative with respect to the ﬁeld. Below we set hα = 0 after taking the derivative. The Fourier transform of the susceptibility χαβ is

χαβ (k) = d D xe−ikx χαβ (x).

(3.42)

In the paramagnetic phase, χαβ (k) ≡ δαβ χ (k), and the susceptibility χ (k) will play a central role in our analysis.
We can also Fourier transform the ﬁeld φα(x) to φα(k), and so obtain the following representation of the action from (3.25):

(3.43)

Classical phase transitions

In this representation it is clear that the quadratic term in the action is diagonal, and so the inversion of the matrix A is immediate. In particular, from (3.31) we have the susceptibility at u = 0

χ0(k)

=

1 k2 +

(3.44)

where we have deﬁned χ0(k) to be the value of χ (k) at u = 0. Dyson’s theorem in (3.37) becomes a simple algebraic relation

χ(k) =

(3.45)

We will shortly obtain an explicit expression for (k). Let us now explore some of the consequences of the u = 0 result in (3.44), which
describes Gaussian ﬂuctuations about mean-ﬁeld theory in the paramagnetic phase, r > 0. The zero momentum susceptibility, which we denote simply as χ ≡ χ (k = 0) = 1/r , diverges as we approach the phase transition at K = Kc from the high temperature paramagnetic phase. This divergence is a key feature of the phase transition, and its nature is encoded in the critical exponent γ deﬁned by

χ ∼ (Kc − K )−γ .

(3.46)

At this leading order in u we have γ = 1. We can also examine the spatial correlations in the u = 0 theory. Performing the inverse
Fourier transform to Cαβ (x) = δαβ C(x) we ﬁnd

C(x) =

dDk (2π )D

ei k x (k2 + r )

=

(2π )−D/2 (x ξ )(D−2)/2

K(D−2)/2(x/ξ ),

(3.47)

where here K is the modiﬁed Bessel function, and we have introduced a characteristic

length scale, ξ , deﬁned by

√ ξ = 1/ r .

(3.48)

This is the correlation length, and is a measure of the distance over which ﬂuctuations of

φα (or the underlying spins σiz) are correlated. This is evident from the limiting forms of (3.47) in various asymptotic regimes:

(3.49)

As could be expected of a correlation length, the correlations decay exponentially to zero at distances larger than ξ .
An important property of our expression in (3.48) for the correlation length is that it diverges upon the approach to the critical point. This divergence is also associated with a critical exponent, ν, deﬁned by

ξ ∼ (Kc − K )−ν ,

(3.50)

3.3 Fluctuations and perturbation theory

and our present theory yields ν = 1/2. In the vicinity of the phase transition, this large value of ξ provides an a-posteriori justiﬁcation of our taking a continuum perspective on the ﬂuctuations. In other words, it supports our mapping from the lattice models in (3.1) and (3.2) to the classical ﬁeld theory in (3.25), where we replaced the lattice spin variables by the collective ﬁeld φα using (3.18).
Let us now move beyond the u = 0 theory, and consider the corrections at order u. After mapping to Fourier space, the result in (3.38) for the self-energy yields

(3.51)

Here, and below, there is an implicit upper bound of k < needed to obtain ﬁnite answers for the wavevector integrals. The N dependence comes from keeping track of the spin index α along each line of the Feynman diagram, and allowing for the different possible contractions of such indices at each u interaction point. We then have from (3.45) our main result for the correction in the susceptibility:

(3.52)

The ﬁrst consequence of (3.52) is a shift in the position of the critical point. From (3.46), a natural way to deﬁne the position of the phase transition is by the zero of 1/χ . The order u correction in (3.52) shows that the critical point is no longer at r = rc = 0, but at

dD p (2π )D

(3.53)

Now, let us combine (3.52) and (3.53) to determine the behavior of χ as r rc. We introduce the coupling s deﬁned by

s ≡ r − rc,

(3.54)

which measures the deviation of the system from the critical point. Rewriting (3.52) in terms of s rather than r (we will always use s in favor of r in all subsequent analysis), we have

1 χ

=s+u

N +2 6

dD p (2π )D

1 p2 + s

.

(3.55)

We are interested in the vicinity of the critical point, at which s → 0. A crucial point is that the nature of this limit depends sensitively on whether D is greater
than or less than four. For D > 4, we can simply expand the integrand in (3.55) in powers of s and obtain

1 χ

= s(1 − c1u

D−4),

(3.56)

where c1 is a nonuniversal constant dependent upon the nature of the cutoff. Thus the effects of interactions appear to be relatively innocuous: the static susceptibility still diverges with the mean-ﬁeld form χ (0) ∼ 1/s as s → 0, with the critical exponent γ = 1. This is in fact the generic behavior to all orders in u, and all the mean-ﬁeld critical exponents apply for D > 4.

42

Classical phase transitions

For D < 4, we notice that the integrand in (3.55) is convergent at high momenta, and so it is permissible to send → ∞. We then ﬁnd that the correction to ﬁrst order in u has a universal form

1 χ

=s

1−

N +2 6

2 ((4 − D)/2) u (D − 2)(4π )D/2 s(4−D)/2

.

(3.57)

Note that no matter how small u is, the correction term eventually becomes important for a sufﬁciently small s, and indeed it diverges as s → 0. So for sufﬁciently large ξ , the meanﬁeld behavior cannot be correct, and a resummation of the perturbation expansion in u is necessary.
The situtation becomes worse at higher orders in u. As suggested by (3.57), the perturbation series for 1/(sχ ) is actually in powers of u/s(4−D)/2, and so each successive term diverges more strongly as s → 0. Thus the present perturbative analysis is unable to describe the vicinity of the critical point for D < 4. We will show that this problem is cured by a renormalization group treatment in the following chapter.

Exercises

3.1 Consider an Ising model on a system of N sites. Let N↑ be the number of up spins. Calculate (N↑, N ), the total number of ways these N↑ spins could have been placed among the N sites. Obtain the entropy S = kB ln as a function of the magnetization m = (N↑ − N↓)/N , where N↓ = N − N↑. Combine this computation of the entropy with a mean-ﬁeld estimate of the average internal energy to obtain (3.16).
3.2 Ising antiferromagnet: We consider the Ising antiferromagnet on a square lattice. The
Hamiltonian is

HI = J σi σ j ,
ij

(3.58)

where i, j extend over the sites of a square lattice, i j refers to nearest neighbors, and σi = ± 1. Note that there is no minus sign in front of J . We take J > 0, so the ferromagnetic state, with all σi parallel, is the highest energy state. The ground states have the pattern of a chess board: σi = 1 on one sublattice (A) and σi = − 1 on the other sublattice (B), and vice versa. Use mean-ﬁeld theory to describe the phase
diagram of this model. Argue that the mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian should have two ﬁelds,
h A and h B, on the two sublattices, and correspondingly, two magnetizations m A and m B. Obtain equations for m A and m B and determine the value of Tc. 3.3 XY model: We generalize the Ising model (with binary spin variables σi ) to a model of vector spins, Si , of unit length (Si2 = 1 at each i). This is a model of ferromagnetism in materials, e.g. iron, in which the electron spin is free to rotate in all direc-
tions (rather than being restricted to be parallel or anti-parallel to a given direction,
as in the Ising model). For simplicity, let us assume that the spin is only free to rotate

Use these equations to evaluate ∂ F/∂m and so obtain the mean-ﬁeld equation for m (note that you do not need an explicit form for F0 to obtain this) and determine the critical temperature on a lattice with coordination number q. 3.4 Critical exponents: In mean-ﬁeld theory, the free energy density of the Ising model near its critical point can be obtained by minimizing the functional of the magnetization density m:

and the critical point is at α = 0 (assume, K , β > 0). Determine the correlation functions G11(r ) = m1(r )m1(0) − m1(r ) m1(0) and G22(r ) = m2(r )m2(0) − m2(r ) m2(0) for both signs of α. You can compute these correlation functions by applying an external ﬁeld h(r ) to the system, under which

By writing m in the above form, you can read off the values of Gaa. Above the critical temperature (α > 0), you should ﬁnd G11 = G22, which is a simple consequence of rotational i√nvariance. Below the critical temperature, (α < 0), choose the state with m1(r ) = |α|/β and m2(r ) = 0 in zero ﬁeld. You should ﬁnd G11 = G22, and determine both functions in 3 dimensions.

The renormalization group

In Chapter 3 we developed the basic tools to describe the phase transition in the classical Ising model, and its cousins with N -component spins. We argued that the vicinity of the critical point at K = Kc could be described by the classical ﬁeld theory in (3.25). However, we observed that an expansion of the observable properties in powers of the quartic coupling u broke down near the critical point for dimensions D < 4. We will now show how the renormalization group circumvents this breakdown.
In its full generality, the renormalization group (RG) is a powerful tool with applications in many ﬁelds of physics, and covered at great lengths in other texts. Our treatment here will be relatively brief, and will be directed towards addressing the critical properties of the classical ﬁeld theory in (3.25).
The key to the success of the RG is that it exposes a new symmetry of the critical point at K = Kc, which is not present in the underlying Hamiltonian. This symmetry can be understood to be a consequence of the divergence of the correlation length, ξ , at K = Kc, as indicated in (3.50). With the characteristic length scale equal to inﬁnity, we may guess that the structure of the correlations is the same at all length scales, i.e. the physics is invariant under a scaling transformation under which the coordinates change as

x → x = x/b,

(4.1)

where b is the rescaling factor. In other words, the basic structure of all correlations should be invariant under a transformation from the x to the x coordinates. An example of this invariance appears in our result for the two-point correlation function C(x) ∼ x2−D for x ξ in (3.49); this is only rescaled by an overall prefactor under the transformation (4.1). We should note here that the lattice statistical mechanics model does have a characteristic length scale, which is a the lattice spacing; the invariance under (4.1) holds only at lengths much larger than a, and only at the critical point.
We will see that the role of the scale invariance is similar to that of other, more familiar, symmetries. As an example, symmetry under rotations is due to an invariance of the Hamiltonian under a change in angular coordinates θ = θ + b; (4.1) is an analogous coordinate transformation. Further, we know that rotational invariance classiﬁes observables according to how they respond to the coordinate change: scalars, vectors, tensors, . . ., which are labeled by different values of the angular momentum. We will similarly ﬁnd that scale invariance labels observables by their scaling dimension.

45

46

The renormalization group

4.1 Gaussian theory

It is useful to begin with a simpliﬁed model for which the scaling transformations can be exactly computed. This is the free ﬁeld theory obtained from (3.25) at u = 0: let us write it down here explicitly for completeness:

Z=

Dφα(x) exp

−1 2

d D x (∇x φα)2 + r φα2(x)

.

(4.2)

It is now easy to see that all correlations associated with this ensemble will maintain their form if we combine the rescaling transformation (4.1) with the deﬁnitions

φα(x ) = b(D−2)/2φα(x), r = b2r.

(4.3)

The powers of b appearing in (4.3) are the scaling dimensions of the respective variables, which we denote as

dim[φ] = (D − 2)/2,

dim[r ] = 2.

(4.4)

Also, by deﬁnition, we always have from (4.1) that dim[x] = −1. These scaling transformations now place strong restrictions on the form of the correla-
tion functions. Thus for the two-point correlation of φα, we have from (4.3) that

φα(x )φβ (0) = b(D−2) φα(x)φβ (0) .

(4.5)

However, both correlators are evaluated in the same ensemble, and φα and φα are merely dummy variables of integration which can be relabeled at will. Therefore the correlators must have the same functional dependence on the spatial coordinates and the couplings constants, and so

C(x/b; b2r ) = bD−2C(x; r ),

(4.6)

where we have indicated the dependence of the correlator on the coupling r , which was previously left implicit. This is the payoff equation from the RG transformation, and places a nontrivial constraint on the form of the correlations; it can be checked that the results (3.47) and (3.48) do obey (4.6).
Although it is strictly not necessary here, it will be useful to build the rescaling transformation by the factor b via a series of inﬁnitesimal transformations. This is analogous to the use of angular momentum to generate inﬁnitesimal rotation in quantum mechanics. Here, we set b = 1 + d , where d 1, and build up to a ﬁnite rescaling b = e by a repeated action of inﬁnitesimal rescalings. These rescalings are most conveniently represented in terms of differential equations representing the RG ﬂow of the coupling constants. In the present case, we have only the coupling r , and by (4.3) or (4.4), its ﬂow is represented by

dr = 2r.

(4.7)

d

47

4.1 Gaussian theory

The constraint on the correlator in (4.6) can be written as

C(e− x, r ( )) = e(D−2) C(x, r ).

(4.8)

The result of the RG ﬂow (4.7) is very simple. For an initial value r > 0, we have r → ∞ as increases: this represents the physics of the paramagnetic phase. Similarly for r < 0, we have r → −∞ as increases, representing the ferromagnetic phase. In between these two divergent ﬂows, we have the ﬁxed point r = r ∗ = 0, where r is -independent. This
ﬁxed point represents the phase transition between the two phases. Note that at an RG ﬁxed point, we can set r = r ∗ on both sides of a rescaling equation like (4.8), and so
then the correlations are invariant under a rescaling of coordinates alone. Here, we have C(e− x) = e(D−2) C(x), whose solution is

C(x) ∼ x2−D, r = r ∗,

(4.9)

which agrees with (3.49). The above connection between RG ﬁxed points and scale-invariance at phase transitions
is very general, and we will meet numerous other examples. The “homogeneity” relationship (4.8) for the correlation function is also in a form that applies in many more complex situations.
Our main result so far has been the identiﬁcation of the “Gaussian ﬁxed point,” r ∗ = 0, of the RG transformation. Let us now look at the stability of this ﬁxed point to other perturbations to the action. The simplest, and most important, is the quartic coupling u already contained in (3.25). Applying the transformation (4.3) we now see that u transforms as

u = b4−Du.

(4.10)

Equivalently, this can be written as the RG ﬂow equation

du = (4 − D)u. d

(4.11)

Thus in the more complete space of the two couplings r and u, the Gaussian ﬁxed point is identiﬁed by r ∗ = 0 and u∗ = 0.

We also notice a crucial dichotomy in the ﬂow of u away from this Gaussian ﬁxed point. For D > 4, the ﬂow of u is back towards u∗ = 0 as increases. In RG parlance, the Gaussian
ﬁxed point is stable towards u perturbations for D > 4. This result is entirely equivalent to

our more pedestrian observation in (3.56), where we found that perturbation theory in u did not change the leading critical singularity for D > 4. Conversely, for D < 4, the Gaussian

ﬁxed point is unstable to u perturbations. This means that we have to ﬂow away from u∗ = 0. As we will see below, the ﬂow is towards a new ﬁxed point with u∗ = 0, known

as the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point. It is the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point which will cure the problem with perturbation theory in D < 4 identiﬁed in (3.57).
Before embarking on our search for the stable ﬁxed point for D < 4, let us also consider

other possible perturbations to the Gaussian ﬁxed point. A simple example is the six-order coupling v deﬁned by

Sφ → Sφ + v

dDx

φα2 (x )

3
.

(4.12)

48

The renormalization group

Application of (4.3) easily yields

dv = (6 − 2D)v, d

(4.13)

and so v∗ = 0 is stable for D > 3. In alternative common terminology, v is “irrelevant” for

D > 3. A similar analysis can be applied to all possible local couplings which are invariant

under O(N ) symmetry, and it is found that they are all irrelevant for D ≥ 3. This was the

underlying reason for our focus on the ﬁeld theory in (3.25), with only a single quartic

nonlinearity. The coupling v is “marginal” at the Gaussian ﬁxed point in D = 3, but we

will see that it does not play an important role at the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point.

4.2 Momentum shell RG

Our RG analysis so far has not been much more than gloriﬁed dimensional analysis. Nevertheless, the simple setting of the Gaussian ﬁeld theory has been a useful place to establish notation and introduce key concepts. We are now ready to face the full problem of classical ﬁeld theory (3.25) in D ≤ 4 in the presence of the quartic nonlinearity.
The structure of the perturbation expansion in Section 3.3.2 shows that well-deﬁned expressions for the ﬂuctuation corrections are obtained only in the presence of a wavevector cutoff . So in our scaling transformations we also have to keep track of the length scale
−1. True scale invariance at the critical point appears only at length scales much larger than −1, and we need a more general RG procedure which allows such an asymptotic scale invariance to develop.
The needed new idea is that of decimation of the degrees of freedom. The ﬁrst step in the RG will be a partial integration (or “decimation”) of some of the short-distance degrees of freedom. This results in a new problem with a smaller number of degrees of freedom. In our formulation with a momentum cutoff , the new problem has a smaller cutoff < . We choose = /b, and integrate degrees of freedom in the shell in momentum space between these momenta.
The second step of the RG is the rescaling transformation already discussed. Given the mapping of length scale x = x/b, the mapping of the cutoff is

=b = .

(4.14)

Note that after the complete RG transformation, the initial and ﬁnal cutoffs are equal. Thus our RG will be deﬁned at a ﬁxed cutoff . This is very useful, because we need no longer keep track of factors of cutoff in any of the scaling relations, and can directly compare theories simply by comparing the values of coupling constants like r , u, . . .
Now we only need an implementation of the ﬁrst decimation step. The second rescaling step will proceed just as in Section 4.1.
The key to the decimation procedure is the decomposition

φα(x) = φα<(x) + φα>(x),

(4.15)

(4.16)

Then we evaluate the partition function as usual, but integrate only over the ﬁelds at large momenta φ>:

exp −Sφ< = Dφα>(x) exp −Sφ .

(4.17)

The resulting functional integral deﬁnes a functional Sφ< of the low momentum ﬁelds alone, which we will now compute to the needed order. An important property which facilitates the present analysis is that the φ< and φ> decouple at the Gaussian ﬁxed point, i.e. the Gaussian action is a sum of terms which involve only φ< or φ>, but not both.
This decoupling is a consequence of their disjoint support in the momentum space, and
consequently we can write

Sφ =

Z> =

d D x (∇x φα>)2 + r φα>2(x) ,

(4.20)

and the expectation value in the last term in (4.19) is taken under this Gaussian ensemble
(as indicated by the subscript). The second term in (4.19) is an additive constant, and is
important in computations of the free energy; we do not include it below because it plays
no role in renormalization of the coupling constants.
It now remains to evaluate the expectation value in the last term in (4.19). This is easily done in powers of u using the methods described in Section 3.3.1. Notice that φ< appears as a source term, whose powers will multiply various correlation functions of the φ>; the
latter can be evaluated by Wick’s theorem, or equivalently by Feynman diagrams. Thus all internal lines in the Feynman diagram represent φ>, while external lines are φ<. We
show the Feynman diagrams that are important to us in Fig. 4.1 The spatial dependence of φα<(x) determines the momenta that are injected into the Feynman diagrams by the external vertices. We are ultimately interested in a spatial gradient expansion of the resulting action functional of φ<, and this means that we can expand the Feynman diagrams in powers of
the external momenta.

50

The renormalization group

tFig. 4.1

Feynman graphs important for the Wilson–Fisher RG equations. The external lines represent φ<, while the internal lines are φ> propagators. The ﬁrst graph renormalizes r, while the second renormalizes u.

In the action functional for φ< so obtained, we obtain terms which have the same form as those in the original Sφ in (3.25). We also obtain a number of other terms which involve higher powers of φ< or additional gradients: we have just argued at the end of Section 4.1
that these other terms are not important, and so we can safely drop them here. The ﬁrst graph in Fig. 4.1 renormalizes terms that are quadratic in φ<, and this turns out to be independent of momentum: this is related to the k independence of the self-energy (k) in (3.51). The second graph in Fig. 4.1 is quartic in φ<, and this can be evaluated at zero
external momenta because we are not interested in gradients of the quartic term. Collecting
terms in this manner, the ﬁnal results of (4.19) can be written as

Note that the coefﬁcient of the gradient term does not renormalize: this is an artifact of the low-order expansion, and will be repaired below. The other terms do renormalize, and have the modiﬁed values

Finally, it should be reiterated that the theory Sφ< in (4.21) has an implicit momentum cutoff of = /b.
We can now immediately implement the second rescaling step of the RG and obtain the new couplings

r = b2r , u = b4−Du.

(4.23)

Finally, we specialize to an inﬁnitesimal rescaling b = 1 + d , expand everything to ﬁrst order in d , and obtain the RG ﬂow equations

Let us momentarily ignore concerns about the range of validity of RG ﬂow equations, and examine the consequences of integrating (4.24). The results are shown in Fig. 4.2. In addition to the r ∗ = u∗ = 0 Gaussian ﬁxed point already found, we observe there is a second ﬁxed point at nonzero values r ∗ and u∗: this is the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, and it will be the focus of our attention.
However, before embarking upon a study of the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, we need a systematic method of assessing the reliability of our results. Wilson and Fisher pointed out that a very useful expansion is provided by

≡ 4 − D.

(4.25)

Even though the physical values of D are integer, all our expressions for the perturbative expansions, Feynman diagrams, and ﬂow equations have been analytic functions of D. So we can consider an analytic continuation to the complex D plane, and hence to small . The expansion in powers of has since established itself as an invaluable tool in describing a variety of classical and quantum critical points.
We can now systematically determine the values of r ∗ and u∗ by an expansion of (4.24). We ﬁnd

(4.26)

All the omitted higher order terms in (4.24), and all other terms higher order in φα, or with additional gradients that could have been added to Sφ will not modify the results in (4.26). This includes the effect of the coupling v in (4.12), which is actually irrelevant for small .

52

The renormalization group

Let us now examine the nature of the ﬂows near r ∗ and u∗, and their implication for

the critical properties of Sφ, and the underlying O(N ) spin models. The phases of the spin

models are accessed by varying a single coupling K . The initial values of r and u depend

upon the value of K , and so varying K will move us along a line in the r –u plane: this

line of initial values is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 4.2. Now notice that the RG ﬂows

predict two very distinct ﬁnal consequences as we vary K . On the right of the point A in

Fig. 4.2, all points ultimately ﬂow to r → ∞; it is natural to identify all such points as

residing in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. In contrast, points to the left of A

ﬂow to r → −∞, as is natural in the ferromagnetic phase. The only point on the line of

initial values to avoid these fates is the point A itself, and it ﬂows directly into the Wilson–

Fisher ﬁxed point. It is therefore natural to identify A as the point K = Kc. Thus we have

established that, for essentially all realizations of the O(N ) spin model, the physics of the

critical point is described by the ﬁeld theory of the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point. This is a key

step in the “proof” of the hypothesis of universality: independent of the set of microscopic

couplings in H , the critical point is described by the same universal ﬁeld theory.

Let us examine the structure of the ﬂows near the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point. Deﬁning,

r = r ∗ + δr and u = u∗ + δu/SD, (4.24) yields the linearized equations

(4.27)

These equations are most easily integrated by diagonalizing the coefﬁcient matrix: this is done by deﬁning two new eigen-couplings w1,2 which are different, linearly-independent combinations of δr and δu. The ﬂow of the eigen-couplings is simply

d wi d

(4.28)

with the eigenvalues

λ1

(N + 2) (N + 8)

λ2 = − + O( 2).

(4.29)

The ﬂows in (4.29) are now ﬁnally as simple as those for the Gaussian theory in Section 4.1. Regardless of its initial value, the coupling w2 is attracted to w2∗ = 0 and so can be regarded as irrelevant. Setting w2∗ = 0 puts us on the track to identifying the universal properties of the critical point. Notice however, that the eigenvalue λ2 has a small magnitude, and so the ﬂow towards the universal theory will be slow: we expect this ﬂow of w2 to provide the
leading corrections to the universal critical behavior.
Our entire RG analysis has therefore been reduced to the ﬂow of a single relevant cou-
pling w1, with the simple ﬂow equation (4.28). Just as was the case with the coupling r in Section 4.1, the critical point is at w1 = w1∗ = 0, and so may identify this coupling

w1 ∼ Kc − K

(4.30)

as a measure of the deviation from criticality. The ﬂow of w1 when combined with the rescaling of the ﬁeld φα leads to a number of interesting physical consequences which we explore below.

53

4.3 Field renormalization

4.3 Field renormalization

The entire analysis in Section 4.2 did not modify the original rescaling of the ﬁeld φα deﬁned in (4.3). This is actually an artifact of working to ﬁrst order in . At higher orders in we do ﬁnd a momentum in the self-energy, and consequently a renormalization of the gradient term in Sφ, leading to change in the RG rescaling of φα. A complete treatment of these effects is far more efﬁciently carried out using a more formal ﬁeld-theoretical RG which we will not describe now. Rather we will be satisﬁed with a shortcut which yields the leading nonvanishing renormalization after some reasonable assumptions.
Anticipating the ﬁeld scale renormalization, we deﬁne the RG rescaling of φα by

φα(x ) = b(D−2+η)/2φα(x),

(4.31)

where η is known as the anomalous dimension of the ﬁeld φα. This is of course equivalent to

dim[φα] = (D − 2 + η)/2.

(4.32)

Assuming (4.32), the generalization of the relation (4.8) for the correlator C(x) at the critical point K = Kc or w1 = 0 is

C(e− x) = e(D−2+η) C(x).

(4.33)

This implies C(x) ∼ x−(D−2+η). Taking the Fourier transform, we have for the susceptibility

χ (k )

∼

1 k 2−η

.

(4.34)

Let us see how (4.34) could emerge from an analysis of the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point. We set r = r ∗ and u = u∗, and compute χ (k) using (3.45) and a perturbative expansion for the self-energy (k). Because we are at the critical point, χ −1(0) should vanish, and hence we should have r − (0) = 0; thus χ −1(k) = k2 − (k) + (0). At ﬁrst order in u, (k) is
k-independent, and so we have no correction to the free ﬁeld behavior. However, at second
order in u, we obtain a momentum-dependent given by the Feynman diagram in Fig. 4.3
(which corresponds to the last term in (3.38)), which yields

To leading nonvanishing order in , we can set u = u∗, r = 0, and D = 4 above. The result-

ing two-loop integral requires some technical results from the mathematical theory of

Feynman graphs to evaluate; the reader can ﬁnd a concise and useful discussion, with a

valuable table of integrals, in the book by Ramond [392]. Evaluating the integral in this

manner we ﬁnd

(k) = . . . −

(4.36)

Inserting this into χ −1(k) = k2 − (k) + (0), and assuming the logarithm is the ﬁrst term in a series which exponentiates, we obtain the form in (4.34). Using the value of u∗
in (4.26), we obtain our needed result for the anomalous dimension of φα:

(4.37)

4.4 Correlation functions

The results of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 will now be collected and applied to determine the form of correlations near the critical point.
Given the form of the ﬁeld scaling relation (4.32), and the ﬂow of the relevant coupling w1 in (4.28), the most complete form of the homogeneity relation (4.8) for the two-point φα correlator is

C(e− x; w1eλ1 ) = e(D−2+η) C(x; w1).

(4.38)

Recall that we have already set the leading irrelevant coupling w2 = w2∗ = 0, and so we are dealing exclusively with the “universal theory.” The relation (4.38) holds for any , and so let us evaluate it at = ∗ where w1eλ1 ∗ = ± 1; the choice in sign will depend upon the sign of the initial value of w1, i.e. whether we are above or below the critical point. Then
it takes the form

C(x; w1) = ξ −(D−2+η) F±(x/ξ ),

(4.39)

where we have set ξ = e ∗ and F± are as yet undetermined functions, known as the scaling functions; the subscript indicates the distinct forms of the scaling function on the two sides
of the critical point. The structure of (4.39) is very informative: it indicates that as we change the value of the coupling w1, the x dependence of the correlations changes at the characteristic scale ξ . It is therefore natural to identify ξ with the correlation length, the analog of the quantity that appeared in (3.47) in the Gaussian theory; indeed, it is easy to
see that (3.47) is of the form (4.39), with an explicit result for the scaling function F+, and an exponent η = 0 as expected at the Gaussian ﬁxed point. We will mainly be interested in

55

4.4 Correlation functions

(4.39) at the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, where η is given by (4.37), and we can make an analogous expansion for the scaling functions F±.
The above results also specify the divergence of ξ at the critical point. Using the expressions just before and after (4.39), we have

ξ ∼ |w1|−1/λ1 ∼ |Kc − K |−ν .

(4.40)

We meet again the correlation exponent ν, whose value is given quite generally by

ν= 1. λ1

(4.41)

In other words, the exponent ν is the inverse of the relevant RG eigenvalue. Implicit in our

discussion is the assumption that there is only one such relevant eigenvalue, and that all

other perturbations are irrelevant at the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point. The reader will recog-

nize that we have in fact established this strong and powerful result to leading order in .

There is overwhelming numerical evidence that such a result is also true at the physically

important value of = 1, and this is behind the success of the expansion.

We will also have occasion to meet RG ﬁxed points with either zero or more than one

relevant perturbation. Those with zero relevant perturbations describe critical phases rather

than critical points; for all couplings not too far from the ﬁxed point, the ﬂow is towards the

ﬁxed point, and hence the long-distance correlations have characteristics independent of all

microscopic parameters. The extent of such critical phases is determined by the domain of

attraction of the RG ﬁxed point. RG ﬁxed points with more than one relevant perturbation

describe “multicritical points.” Reaching such multicritical points requires that we tune

more than one linearly independent coupling in the underlying Hamiltonian: the number

of tuning parameters is equal to the number of relevant perturbations.

Finally, let us show that (4.39) also allows us to determine all other critical exponents

we have deﬁned so far. Integrating (4.39) over all x, we obtain using (3.42) the result for

the wavevector-dependent susceptibility

χ (k) = ξ 2−η F±(kξ ),

(4.42)

where the scaling functions F± are Fourier transforms of F±. This result clearly generalizes (4.34) away from the critical point. As long as we are not at the critical point, we expect the susceptibility to be nonsingular as k → 0, and so the F± will approach nonzero constants in the limit of zero argument. Consequently, the uniform static susceptibility behaves as

χ ∼ ξ 2−η,

(4.43)

or the critical exponent γ in (3.46) is given by the exact “scaling relation”

γ = (2 − η)ν.

(4.44)

It remains to determine the critical exponent β for the ferromagnetic moment φα = N0eˆα, where eˆα is an arbitrary unit N -component vector. As discussed regarding (3.24), this moment vanishes as

N0 ∼ (K − Kc)β ,

(4.45)

56

The renormalization group

as we approach the critical point from low temperatures. Rather than deducing directly from (4.39), let us reapply the RG transformation from scratch. Application of the fundamental scaling relation (4.31) tells us that

N0(w1eλ1 ) = e(D−2+η) /2 N0(w1),

(4.46)

where again we neglect the inﬂuence of irrelevant couplings like w2. Evaluating (4.46) at = ∗ as before, we obtain (4.45) with the scaling relation

β = (D − 2 + η)ν/2.

(4.47)

More generally, we can regard (4.47) as the most important application of a scaling relation determining the singular contribution to the average value of any observable O

[ O ]sing ∼ ξ −dim[O].

(4.48)

An important case of the above result is the scaling of the free energy density F = − (1/V ) ln Z, where V is the D-dimensional volume of the system. The partition function Z is a RG invariant, and so the scaling dimension of ln Z must be zero. Consequently

dim[F] = D,

(4.49)

and the singular part of the free energy density scales as ξ −D. This result is often stated in terms of the exponent of the speciﬁc heat (see Exercise 3.4) −∂2F /∂r 2 ∼ |K − Kc|−α for
which we have the “hyperscaling relation”

α = 2 − Dν.

(5.1)

We will examine the eigenstates of HI in more detail in the large and small-g limits. These limits were also studied brieﬂy in Section 1.4.1, where we argued that there was a quantum phase transition at some intermediate value g = gc. We will also study the quantum to classical mapping introduced in Chapter 2, and carefully establish [127, 378] the mapping to the classical Ising model of (2.2). This mapping will eventually lead us to a ﬁeld-theoretical analysis of the vicinity of the quantum critical point at gc.
Before embarking on the large and small-g expansions of HI , we introduce the effective Hamiltonian method in Section 5.1. This is an indispensable tool for characterizing the spectrum of this and other models. This method is described in textbooks on quantum mechanics, and we only recall a basic result which we will put to extensive use.
We then use the effective Hamiltonian method to examine the spectrum of HI under strong-(g 1) and weak-(g 1) coupling limits, which were discussed brieﬂy in Section 1.4.1. The analysis is relatively straightforward in these limits, and two very different physical pictures emerge. In d = 1, the model HI is exactly solvable, and this is described later in Chapter 10: this exact solution shows that there is a critical point exactly at g = gc = 1, but that the qualitative properties of the ground states for g > gc (g < gc) are very similar to those for g 1 (g 1). We argue below, and in the following chapters, that these features also hold for d > 1, where no exact solution is possible. One of the two limiting descriptions is therefore always appropriate, and only the critical point g = gc has genuinely different properties at T = 0.

5.1 Effective Hamiltonian method
We consider a Hamiltonian of the form H = H0 + H1, where the eigenstates of H0 are easily determined, and we are interested in describing the inﬂuence of H1 in perturbation theory. Further, we assume that the eigenvalues of H0 are separated into distinct groups of closely-spaced levels, such that the energy separation between two levels within the same group is always much smaller than the separation between two levels in distinct groups. 58

59

5.2 Large-g expansion

We use the symbols α, β, . . . to denote the groups, and i, j, . . . to denote levels within each group. Thus the eigenstates of H0 are |i, α , with eigenenergies Eiα, and so

|Eiα − E jα| |Eiα − E jβ | for α = β.

(5.2)

We are often interested in the structure of the levels within a given group, and would like to understand their behavior without reference to levels in other groups. However, in general, H1 will have nonzero matrix elements between states belonging to different groups: consequently a conventional perturbative analysis will require repeated reference to states lying outside the group of interest. The idea of the effective Hamiltonian method is to perform a unitary transformation which eliminates these inter-group matrix elements. After the unitary transformation, we obtain a new Hamiltonian Heff which has nonzero matrix elements only within each group.
We skip the straightforward, but tedious, analysis needed to obtain Heff order-by-order in H1. We quote here only the ﬁnal result to second order in H1. The new Hamiltonian Heff is deﬁned by the following nonzero matrix elements between any two levels, |i, α and | j, α belonging to the same group α:

i, α|Heff| j, α = Eiαδi j + i, α|H1| j, α

+

i, α|H1|k, β k, β|H1| j, α

(5.3)

Naturally, we have i, α|Heff| j, β = 0 for all α = β, ensuring that Heff is block diagonal, and we can work independently within each group α.

5.2 Large-g expansion

In the interests of simplicity, we will restrict our discussion of the large-g expansion to the case d = 1. The generalization to d > 1 involves only minor differences, and these will be noted explicitly where needed. The situation is very different for the small-g expansion discussed in the following section: there the cases d = 1 and d > 1 require a separate analysis.
The g = ∞ ground state was presented in (1.9), where we also discussed the nature of the 1/g corrections. We found a quantum paramagnetic ground state, invariant under the Z2 symmetry (1.13), with exponentially decaying σˆ z correlations as in (1.11). Conventional perturbation theory can be used to obtain the ground state wavefunction and energy in powers of 1/g. On a system of M sites, with periodic boundary conditions, the ground state energy is

E0 = −M J g 1 + 1/(4g2) + O(1/g3) ,

(5.4)

where the leading corrections arise from virtual states with two left-pointing spins created by the exchange term in HI .

60

The quantum Ising model

What about the excited states? For g = ∞ these can also be listed exactly, and the levels appear in groups as needed for the effective Hamiltonian method. The lowest excited states are

|i = | ← i | → j ,
j =i

(5.5)

obtained by ﬂipping the state on site i to the other eigenstate of σˆ x (the eigenstates of σˆ x were deﬁned in (1.10)). There are M such states, and they are degenerate with energy E0 + 2J g. We will refer to them as the “single-particle” states. Similarly, the next degenerate manifold of states is the two-particle states |i, j , obtained by ﬂipping the spins at sites i and j; clearly, there are M(M − 1)/2 such states, and they have energy E0 + 4J g. Generalizing, we can construct the p particle states: there are M!/((M − p)! p!) states with energy E0 +2 p J g. Identifying the ground state as the p = 0 case, the values p = 0, 1 . . . M clearly span the entire Hilbert space of 2M states. Of course, when p is of order M, this

particle labelling will not be particularly useful.

We now consider the nature of the effective Hamiltonian in the different particle number

subspaces in turn.

5.2.1 One-particle states

For the one-particle states, the exchange term σˆizσˆiz+1 in HI is not diagonal in the basis of the | → , | ← states and leads only to the off-diagonal matrix element

i|HI |i + 1 = −J,

(5.6)

which hops the “particle” between nearest-neighbor sites. As in the tight-binding models of solid state physics [28], the Hamiltonian is therefore diagonalized by going to the momentum space basis

|k = √1

eikx j | j .

Mj

(5.7)

This eigenstate has energy

εk = J g[2 − (2/g) cos(ka) + O(1/g2)],

(5.8)

where a is the lattice spacing, and we have dropped an additive term of the ground state energy E0. Henceforth, all particle excitation energies will be measured relative to E0. The lowest energy one-particle state is therefore at ε0 = 2g J − 2J .
At next order in 1/g, HI mixes the one-particle states with the zero- and two-particle states. Their inﬂuence on the one-particle subspace can be described by direct application of (5.3): we ﬁnd terms by which the particle can hop to second neighbors. (Actually, initially it appears that there are terms by which the particle can hop arbitrary distances, but these cancel between the contributions of the zero- and two-particle subspaces.) The wavefunction (5.7) still diagonalizes the effective Hamiltonian in the one-particle subspace, and then (5.8) improves to (Exercise 5.1)

εk = J g[2 − (2/g) cos(ka) + (1 − cos(2ka))/(2g2) + O(1/g3)].

(5.9)

61

5.2 Large-g expansion

This is a convenient point to deﬁne another useful concept: the quasiparticle residue, A. The operator σˆiz ﬂips the ith spin between | → and | ← , and so moves states up or down one step between the p-particle subspaces. So we can regard σˆ z as the sum of a particle creation and annihilation operator. It is useful to consider the operator at a deﬁnite
momentum k by deﬁning, as in (5.7),

σˆ z(k) = √1 M

ei

k

x

j

σˆ

z j

.

j

(5.10)

Then, the quasiparticle residue is deﬁned by the overlap between the actual one-particle state at momentum k = 0, and that obtained by creating a particle in the ground state by the particle creation operator

A ≡ | k = 0|σˆ z(k)|0 |2.

(5.11)

The computation of A in the 1/g expansion is discussed in Exercise 5.1. We see later that A appears naturally in correlation functions associated with neutron scattering experiments. Also, A is nonzero in the entire paramagnetic phase, but vanishes at the quantum critical point for d ≤ 3.

5.2.2 Two-particle states

Now consider the two-particle states. At g = ∞, the subspace of two-particle states is spanned by the states (generalizing (5.5))

|i, j = | ← i | ← j

| → h,

h=i, j

(5.12)

where i = j. Also note that |i, j = | j, i , and so we may restrict our attention to i > j. Alternatively, we can say that the states are symmetric under interchange of the particle positions i, j, and so we treat the particles as bosons. At ﬁrst order in 1/g, these states will be mixed by the matrix element (5.6); this will couple |i, j to |i ± 1, j and |i, j ± 1 for all i > j + 1, while |i, i − 1 will couple only to |i + 1, i − 1 and |i, i − 2 . For i and j well separated, we can ignore this last case, and the two particles will be independent of each other, with the matrix elements for each particle identical to those considered above for single particles. So the particles will acquire momenta k1, k2 (say), and the total energy of the two-particle state will be Ek = εk1 + εk2 , with a total momentum k = k1 + k2. However, when i and j approach each other, we have to consider mixing between these momentum states arising from the restrictions in the matrix elements noted above. This is a problem in ordinary scattering theory, treated in many elementary quantum mechanics texts.
Thus we have an important general result: among the two-particle states is a set of scattering eigenstates. These states are labelled by a pair of momenta k1, k2 (their ordering is unimportant), and their eigenenergy is exactly the sum of the single-particle energies determined in Section 5.2.1, εk1 +εk2 . Clearly, this result is only true in the thermodynamic limit M → ∞ where it is always possible to separate the single-particle states in well separated regions of the sample. It is also clear that this result holds in all d (integrability in d = 1 plays no role in this conclusion), and is also true for the p-particle states (when we will

62

The quantum Ising model

need p unordered momenta to label the states). The result fails only when p becomes of order M, when it is no longer possible to ﬁnd well separated regions. In other words, we should take the limit M → ∞ at ﬁxed p.
In some cases, there will also be states other than scattering states among the multiparticle states. These are bound states in which two or more particles move together as in a “molecule.” Each bound state will be labelled by a single center-of-mass momentum, independent of the number of particles in the bound state. Consideration of the multiparticle Schrödinger equation in the 1/g expansion (discussed below) shows that there are no bound states in the present situation. However, we will meet bound states shortly in the discussion on the g 1 expansion.
Let us now consider the two-particle scattering states in d = 1 more carefully. The scattering of the two incoming particles with momenta k1, k2 will conserve total energy and, up to a reciprocal lattice vector 2π/a, total momentum. For small k1, k2 (which is our primary interest here), these conservation laws allow only one solution in d = 1: the momenta of the particles in the ﬁnal state are also k1 and k2. The existence of a single ﬁnal state is a special feature of d = 1, while a sum over an inﬁnite number of momenta in the ﬁnal state is required for the problems in d > 1 we consider later. By this reasoning, we can conclude that the wavefunction of the two-particle state will have the following form for i j:

ei(k1xi +k2x j ) + Sk1k2 ei(k2xi +k1x j ) |i, j .

(5.13)

The quantity Sk1k2 is of central importance and is the S matrix for two-particle scattering. Upon interpreting the stationary scattering state in (5.13) from the perspective of a time-dependent scattering problem, in which particles scatter from an incoming wave corresponding to the ﬁrst term in (5.13), to an outgoing wave corresponding to the second term, the S matrix can be related (just as in familiar scattering theory) to the time-evolution operator of HI from the inﬁnite past to the inﬁnite future; it must therefore be a unitary matrix. In the present situation with a single ﬁnal state, the S matrix is a complex number of unit modulus. The computation of the S matrix from the Schrödinger equation at order 1/g is discussed in Exercise 5.2. The result turns out to be remarkably simple; we ﬁnd

Sk1k2 = −1,

(5.14)

for all momenta k1, k2. We will not give an explicit derivation of this result here (a detailed discussion of the computation of such S matrices in general spin models may be found in [107]). Instead, we present a simple argument in the next paragraph that shows that a result such as (5.14) holds in the limit of small k1, k2 for a generic Ising chain with additional further neighbor exchange couplings; the validity of (5.14) at all momenta is a special feature of the nearest neighbor exchange model (5.1) (also considered later in (10.1)). Our argument will also show that (5.14) continues to hold at higher orders in 1/g for small k1, k2.
Transform to the center-of-mass frame of the two particles, and consider the Schrödinger equation for their relative coordinates x = xi − x j . Taking, for simplicity, a repulsive delta function potential uδ(x) between them (the result does not require this special form), we can write down the schematic Schrödinger equation

uδ(x)

ψ(x) = Eψ(x),

(5.15)

where x is their relative coordinate and ψ(x) is the wavefunction in the center of mass frame. We make a simple argument based upon dimensional analysis. Note from (5.15)
that u has the dimensions of inverse length. The S matrix is a dimensionless quantity, and it can be a function only of u and the relative momentum k = k1 − k2. Dimensionally, this can only be of the form S = f (u/k), where f is some unknown function. We are interested in the limit k → 0, which is given by the value of f (∞). However, conceptually, it is much simpler to obtain f (∞) by taking u → ∞ at ﬁxed k. Thus, to slowly moving particles, the potential appears effectively impenetrable. This means that ψ(x) should vanish at x = 0, and its bosonic symmetry under particle exchange implies that it has the form ψ ∼ sin(k|x|/2) for small x. Comparing with (5.13), we conclude that f (∞) = − 1, and so (5.14) holds universally in the limit of small momenta.
Similar considerations can be applied to scattering states in dimensions d > 1. In general, the coupling u in (5.15) has dimensions of (length)(d−2). So the S matrix is a dimensionless function of ukd−2. For d > 2, this means that the k → 0 limit is equivalent to the u → 0 limit. Consequently, there is no scattering at low momenta, and the S matrix equals +1. Note the striking contrast from d = 1, where the low momentum S matrix is generically −1. The d = 2 case is marginal, and is discussed further in Chapter 16: there S matrix reaches +1 at low momenta, but only logarithmically slowly.
We have now described the manner in which 1/g perturbations lift the degeneracy of the g = ∞ two-particle eigenstates (5.12). The energy of a two-particle state with total momentum k is given by Ek = εk1 + εk2 , where k = k1 + k2. Note that, for a ﬁxed k, there is still an arbitrariness in the single-particle momenta k1,2 and so the total energy Ek can take a range of values. There is thus no deﬁnite energy–momentum relation, and we have
instead a “two-particle continuum.” It should be clear, however, that the lowest energy two-particle state in the inﬁnite system (its “threshold”) is at 2ε0.
Most of the above analysis can be generalized to the p > 2 particle states: there are no bound states, and the scattering states have thresholds at pε0.
After accounting for the ﬁnite bandwidth of the p-particle states, it is possible that as g
becomes smaller, the eigenenergies of states with different numbers of particles can start
to overlap. At this point, our effective Hamiltonian method must break down, because the
energy differences between states in two different groups can vanish. The most important
new phenomenon that appears now is the possibility of the decay of particles into multi-
particle ﬁnal states: the rate of this decay can be determined by Fermi’s golden rule. The
simplest example of this is the decay of a single particle into a three-particle ﬁnal state
(the decay to two particles is forbidden by the Z2 symmetry), and this becomes possible for a particle with sufﬁciently large momentum not too far from the quantum critical point. However, the one-particle states with momenta over a ﬁnite range near k = 0 always remain rigorously stable in the paramagnetic phase. This is because their decay is forbidden by energy–momentum conservation as long as the energy gap, ε0, is nonzero: there is not enough kinetic energy to overcome the cost of creating two additional particles, each costing energy at least ε0, at these low momenta.

64

The quantum Ising model

We present a more complete discussion of the stability of single particle states, and of decay processes, after we have developed the ﬁeld-theoretic methods for the vicinity of the quantum critical point.
Upon explicitly carrying out these higher order computations for scattering between multiparticle states for the particular nearest-neighbor model HI , some rather miraculous features emerge for this special Hamiltonian in d = 1. As already noted, the result (5.14) holds not only at small k1, k2, but at all momenta and at all orders in 1/g. There are also no processes involving the decay of particles, even though this might be energetically permitted. This remarkable fact appears quite mysterious at this stage, but is explained rather simply in Section 10.1 using a mapping of HI to fermionic variables.
5.3 Small-g expansion

The g = 0 ground states were given in (1.12). They are twofold degenerate and possess long-range correlations in the magnetic order parameter σˆ z. The spontaneous magnetization N0 equals ± σˆ z in the two ground states, corresponding to spontaneous breaking of the Z2 symmetry (1.13). All of the statements made in this paragraph clearly hold for g = 0, and they will hold for some g > 0 provided that the perturbation theory in g has a nonzero radius of convergence. The exact solution of the d = 1 model discussed in
Chapter 10 veriﬁes that this is indeed the case.
Much of the analysis in the small-g limit parallels that of the large-g expansion in the
previous section. The analog of the expansion in the ground state energy in (5.4) now yields

E0 = −M J d + g2/(4d) + O(g3) ,

(5.16)

in d dimensions, where the second term is the contribution of ﬂuctuations to states with one spin ﬂipped from the majority direction. The spontaneous magnetization can be computed by expanding (1.15), and yields (Exercise 5.3)

N0 = 1 − g2/(8d2) + O(g4).

(5.17)

We ﬁnd that the states are labelled by particle number, but the physical interpretations of the particles are now different from the large-g case. Indeed, the nature of the particle states is very different for d ≥ 2 and d = 1, and so we consider these cases separately. The d > 2 cases are, however, quite similar to d = 2, and so we only describe d = 2 and d = 1 in the subsections below.

5.3.1 d = 2

Here, and below, we only describe the excited states of the ferromagnetic state with moment pointing up, | ↑ in (1.12). Those of the | ↓ state have the corresponding structure after a global spin ﬂip.
Throughout, our d = 2 analysis is carried out on the square lattice, although the generalization to other lattices is straightforward.

65

5.3 Small-g expansion

The single-particle states are quite similar to those of Section 5.2.1, after a ninety degree rotation in spin space. At g = 0, they consist of a single down spin in a background of up spins. Following (5.5), we can write these as

|i = | ↓ i | ↑ j .
j =i

(5.18)

There are M such one-particle states on a lattice of M sites, and at g = 0 they all have energy E0 + 8J .
At order g, we ﬁnd that the transverse ﬁeld term has vanishing matrix elements between the single-particle states. This is different from the 1/g expansion, where (5.6) already induced a nearest-neighbor hopping among the single-particle states. We therefore have to use (5.3) to ﬁnd a nearest-neighbor hopping at order g2. This involves using intermediate states with zero or two particles; we ﬁnd that their contributions to (5.3) cancel among each other, except when the initial and ﬁnal sites are nearest neighbors. (see Exercise 5.3). Then, forming momentum eigenstates just as in (5.7), we ﬁnd that the dispersion of the one-particle states is (we subtract E0 from all energies from now on)

εk = J

(5.19)

Next we turn to the two-particle states. When the two ﬂipped spins are separated from each other, the energy of such states at g = 0 is 16J . However, when the ﬂipped spins are nearest neighbors, their energy takes the smaller value of 12J . These nearest neighbor states therefore form bound states below the two-particle continuum. There are 2M such nearest neighbor states: after moving to momentum eigenstates, this means that there will be two bound states at each momentum k. Again, we need the effective Hamiltonian method to compute the dispersion of these bound states at order g2: this is discussed in Exercise 5.3. We ﬁnd that the bound states are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the horizontal and vertical pairs of spins. In other words, the bound states have an internal angular momentum, and are s and d wave pairs of the single-particle states.
Apart from the 2M bound states, the remaining M(M − 1)/2 − 2M two-particle states form scattering states with energy 16J + O(g). We will not compute their scattering S matrix, but it again involves application of (5.3).
Similar considerations apply to p > 2 particle states. Their scattering states are at 8 p J , but there are always bound states at lower energies. As an example, we show three- and four-particle bound states with energy 14J and 16J in Fig. 5.1.
The three-particle bound state with energy 14J is therefore below the two-particle continuum. In the present magnetically ordered state, there is no symmetry prohibiting a nonzero matrix element between different particle number states at some high order in the effective Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, for a ﬁnite range of small-g, energy conservation will prevent decay of the three-particle bound state with energy 14J into the two-particle continuum, and this bound state is therefore stable. However, the bound states with energy

66

16J will decay into the two-particle continuum. For p-particle bound states with larger p, there are many more channels for decay into scattering states, and so these are much less likely to be stable.
5.3.2 d = 1

We can initially try to describe the low-lying excited states of the d = 1 Ising chain also by the M states in (5.18), which have energy 4J . However, they are degenerate with ∼ M2
states of the following type:

| . . . ↑↑↑↓↓↓↓↑↑↑↑ . . . .

(5.20)

These states can be interpreted as pairs of domain walls between the | ↑ and | ↓ ferromagnetic states. There is no additional energy cost to moving the domain walls apart from each other (i.e. in changing the number of down spins in (5.20)), and we can also view the state in (5.18) as a pair of domain walls on nearest neighbor links. It is not possible to give a one-particle interpretation to these degenerate domain wall-pair states. Particle-like states are labelled by a single momentum, and this can only take ∼ M values.
However, it is clear that a single domain wall (or “kink”) can serve as the needed elementary particle excitation. The one-particle state located between sites i and i + 1 is

· · · |↑ i−2 |↑ i−1 |↑ i |↓ i+1 |↓ i+2 |↓ i+3 |↓ i+4 · · ·
At g = 0 the energy of such a state is 2J , and there are 2M such states. At nonzero g, the transverse ﬁeld term induces nearest neighbor hops between such domain wall states, already at ﬁrst order in g. Consequently, we can form momentum eigenstates, and these have the dispersion

εk = J (2 − 2g cos(ka) + O(g2)).

(5.21)

A novel feature of these one-particle kink states is that they require a large deformation away from the ground state wavefunction: we needed to ﬂip all spins to the right (say) of the particle location. Therefore, they have a nonlocal “topological” character. As a consequence, these particles do not show up as single particle-like excitations in experiments with local probes: this will become clear in our subsequent discussion of correlation

67

5.4 Review

functions in Chapter 10. Nevertheless, they are necessary for a proper and complete understanding of the spectrum of the quantum Ising chain in its ferromagnetic phase.
At energies higher than 2J , the spectrum can be completely interpreted in terms of p-particle scattering states of the kinks; this includes the state in (5.18) which is now part of the two-particle continuum. The S matrix for the collision of two domain walls can be computed in a perturbation theory in g, and we ﬁnd results very similar to those in the strong-coupling 1/g expansion: For the generic Ising chain we ﬁnd Skk = − 1 in the low momentum limit, but for the particular nearest-neighbor chain (10.1) we ﬁnd that there is no particle production, and Skk = − 1 at all momenta to all orders in g. These special features are consequences of the integrability of the quantum Ising chain, which is discussed in Chapter 10. There we will see that the kinks are best interpreted as free fermions.
5.4 Review

Our methods have so far given a satisfactory description of the two phases of the quantum Ising model in all d. For g 1, we have the paramagnetic phase, above which there are particle excitations consisting of “left”-pointing spins. For g 1, we have the ferromagnetic phase with a broken Z2 symmetry and two degenerate ground states with long-range magnetic order. Above these ground states we have excitations consisting either of “bubbles” of spins oriented opposite to the ferromagnetic moment (in d ≥ 2) or of kinks (in d = 1).
We would now like to see how these descriptions meet at the quantum critical point at g = gc between them. We will see that the two descriptions remain qualitatively valid at the lowest energies all the way up to, but not including, the critical point. At higher energies, and also exactly at the critical point, we need a new description.
We reach the needed description by a detour. We now establish the promised equivalence between the d-dimensional quantum Ising model (5.1) and the D = d +1 dimensional classical Ising model (3.1). Then, we transfer the insights developed for the classical critical point in Chapters 3 and 4 to the quantum case.
We begin in Section 5.5 by ﬁrst considering the D = 1 case.
5.5 The classical Ising chain

Here we consider the D = 1, N = 1 classical spin ferromagnet, more commonly known as the ferromagnetic Ising chain [238]. This chain has the partition function

Z=

{σ z =±1}

The quantum Ising model

In all of our discussion of classical statistical mechanics models we absorb “temperature” into the deﬁnition of the coupling constants, as we have done above for K and h; in contrast, the temperature of quantum-mechanical models will always be explicitly indicated, and we will reserve the symbol T for it (as we see below, the total length of the classical model will determine T ). There are a total of Mτ Ising spins (Mτ large), and for convenience we have also added a uniform magnetic ﬁeld h acting on all the spins. We assume periodic boundary conditions, and therefore σMz τ +1 ≡ σ1z.
We evaluate the partition function exactly following the original solution of Ising [238]. The trick is to write Z as a trace over a matrix product, with one matrix for every site on the chain. Note that the partition functions involve the exponential of a sum of terms on the sites of the chain. Rewrite this as the product of exponentials of each term, and we easily obtain

(5.24)

where T1(σ1z, σ2z) = exp(K σ1zσ2z) and T2(σ z) = exp(hσ z). Now note that (5.24) has precisely the structure of a matrix product, if we interpret the two possible values of σ z as the index labeling the rows and columns of a 2 × 2 matrix T1; T2 has only one index and so should be interpreted as a diagonal matrix. Thus we have

Z = Tr (T1T2T1T2 · · · Mτ times · · · ),

(5.25)

where the summation over the {σ z} has been converted to a matrix trace because of the periodic boundary conditions, and

T1 =

T2 =

(5.26)

The matrix T1T2 is identiﬁed as the “transfer matrix” of the Ising chain, H (5.23), the nomenclature suggesting that it transfers the trace over spins from each site to its neighbor. We can manipulate (5.25) into

Z = Tr (T1T2)Mτ = Tr T21/2T1T21/2 Mτ

given by

1,2 = eK cosh(h) ± (e2K sinh2(h) + e−2K )1/2.

(5.29)

With these eigenvalues, (5.27) leads to an exact result for the free energy F = − ln Z. We will return to interpreting this result for F shortly.

69

5.5 The classical Ising chain

Now we show how the above approach can also lead to exact information on correlation functions. For simplicity, we consider only the case h = 0 (the generalization to nonzero h is not difﬁcult) and describe the two-point spin correlator, like that in (3.39)

C( − ) ≡ σ zσ z = 1 exp(−H )σ zσ z . Z {σ z }

Going through exactly the same steps as those in the derivation of (5.27) we see that

where we have assumed that ≥ , and σ z (without a site index) is also interpreted as a 2 × 2 diagonal Pauli matrix σˆ z in (1.8). The trace in (5.31) can be evaluated in closed form
in the basis in which T1 is diagonal. The eigenvectors of T1 are the states in (1.10) and the corresponding eigenvalues are 1 = 2 cosh(K ) and 2 = 2 sinh(K ). Using the matrix elements → |σ z| → = ← |σ z| ← = 0 and → |σ z| ← = → |σ z| ← = 1 we obtain

(5.32)

Equations (5.31) and (5.32) are our main results on the Ising chain with an arbitrary number of sites, Mτ . While simple, they contain a great deal of useful information, as we will now show; much of the structure we extract below generalizes to more complex Ising models with nonnearest-neighbor interactions.
Let us examine the form of the correlations in (5.32) in the limit of an inﬁnite chain (Mτ → ∞); then we have

σ zσ z = (tanh(K )) − .

(5.33)

It is useful for the following discussion to label the spins not by the site index i, but by a physical length coordinate τ ; we have chosen the symbol τ , rather than the more conventional x, because we will shortly interpret this “length” as the imaginary time direction of
a quantum problem. So if we imagine that the spins are placed on a lattice of spacing a, then σ z(τ ) ≡ σ z where

τ = a.

(5.34)

With this notation, we can write (5.33) as C(τ ) ≡ σ z(τ )σ z(0) = e−|τ|/ξ ,

(5.35)

where the correlation length, ξ , is given by

1 ξ

=

1 a

ln coth(K ).

(5.36)

70

The quantum Ising model

We emphasize that the symbol ξ always represents the actual correlation length at h = 0; the actual correlation length for h = 0 will, of course, be different. In the large-K limit, the correlation length becomes much larger than the lattice spacing, a:

ξ ≈ 1 e2K 1, K 1. a2

(5.37)

In the sequel, we shall primarily be interested in physics on the scale of order ξ , in the regime where ξ is much greater than a. It is precisely in this situation that the concepts of the scaling limit and universality become useful, and they are introduced in the following subsections.

5.5.1 The scaling limit

The simplest way to think of the scaling limit is to ﬁrst divide all lengths into “large” and “small” lengths. For the Ising chain, we take the correlation length ξ , the observation scale τ , and the system size

Lτ ≡ Mτ a

(5.38)

as our large lengths, and the lattice spacing, a, as the only small length. The scaling limit of an observable is then deﬁned as its value when all corrections involving the ratio of small to large lengths are neglected.
There are two conceptually rather different, but equivalent, ways of thinking about the scaling limit. We can either send the small length a to zero while keeping the large lengths ﬁxed (as particle physicists are inclined to do) or send all the large lengths to inﬁnity while keeping a ﬁxed (as is more common among condensed matter physicists). Because the physics can only depend upon the ratio of lengths, it is clear that the two methods are equivalent. We shall choose among these points of view at our convenience and show that it is often very useful to straddle this cultural divide and use the insights of both perspectives.
To complete the deﬁnition of the scaling limit, we also have to discuss the manner in which the parameters K and h must be treated. From (5.36), we see that K can be expressed in terms of the ratio of lengths ξ/a; we can use this to eliminate explicit dependence upon K , and then the scaling limit is speciﬁed by the already speciﬁed ξ/a → ∞ limit. It remains to discuss the behavior of h. In general, there is no a-priori way of determining this and one has to examine the structure of the correlation functions to determine the appropriate limit. Let us guess the answer here by a physical argument. The scaling limit involves the study of large K , when the spin correlation length becomes large. Under these conditions, spins a few lattice spacings apart invariably point in the same direction, and they should therefore be sensitive to the mean magnetic ﬁeld h per unit length. This is measured by h˜ , deﬁned by

h˜ ≡ h . a

(5.39)

So we take the scaling limit a → 0 while keeping h˜ ﬁxed; any other choice would result in a limiting theory with spins under the inﬂuence of a ﬁeld with either inﬁnite or vanishing

71

5.5 The classical Ising chain

strength. Alternatively stated, we have chosen 1/h˜ , a quantity with the dimensions of
length, as one of our large length scales.
We have assembled all the necessary steps for the scaling limit. Express any observable in terms of the physical length τ , replace the number of sites Mτ by Lτ /a, solve (5.36) to express K in terms of ξ/a, and use (5.39) to replace h by h˜ . Then take the limit a → 0 at ﬁxed τ , Lτ , ξ , and h˜ .
We ﬁrst describe the results for the free energy. The quantity with the ﬁnite scaling limit
should clearly be the free energy density, F:

F = −(ln Z)/(Mτ a).

(5.40)

First, from (5.29) we obtain in the scaling limit

1,2 ≈

2ξ 1/2 1 ± a (1 + 4h˜ 2ξ 2)1/2 .

(5.42)

where E0 = − K /a is the ground state energy per unit length of the chain in zero external ﬁeld.
In a similar manner, we can take the scaling limit of the correlation function in (5.32), which we recall was in zero external ﬁeld h˜ = 0. We obtain

C(τ ) =

σ z(τ )σ z(0)

1 + e−Lτ /ξ

.

(5.43)

The results (5.42) and (5.43) are the main conclusions of this subsection.

5.5.2 Universality
The assertion of universality is that the results of the scaling limit are not sensitive to the precise microscopic model being used. This can be seen as the formal consequence of the physically reasonable requirement that correlations at the scale of large ξ should not depend upon the details of the interactions on the scale of the lattice spacing, a.
Let us describe this by an explicit example. Suppose, instead of using the model H in (5.23), we worked with a Hamiltonian H1 with both ﬁrst (K1) and second (K2) neighbor exchanges between the Ising spins σ z. This model can also be solved by the transfer matrix methods (one needs a basis of four sites corresponding to the four states of two nearneighbor spins, and the transfer matrix is 4×4), but we will not present the explicit solution here. From the solution we can determine the correlation length, ξ of H1, which will be a function of both K1 and K2. Now, as in Section 5.5.1, express the free energy density in terms of ξ , and take the limit a → 0 at ﬁxed ξ , Lτ , and h˜ . The implication of universality is that the result will be precisely identical to (5.42), with E0 given by the ground state

72

The quantum Ising model

energy density of H1 in zero ﬁeld: E0 = −(K1 + K2)/a. The reader is invited to check this assertion for this simple example.
We can make the above assertion more precise by introducing the concept of a universal scaling function. We write (5.42) in the form

F

=

E0

+

1 Lτ

F

Lτ ξ

,

h˜

Lτ

,

(5.44)

where F is the universal scaling function, whose explicit value can be easily deduced by comparing with (5.42). Notice that the arguments of F are simply the two dimensionless ratios that can be made out of the three large lengths at our disposal: Lτ , ξ , and 1/h˜ . The prefactor, 1/Lτ , in front of F is necessary because the free energy density has dimensions of inverse length.
As its name implies, the scaling function F is independent of microscopic details. In contrast, E0, the ground state energy of the Ising chain, clearly depends sensitively on the values of the microscopic exchange constants; it is therefore identiﬁed as a nonuniversal additive contribution to F.
In a similar manner, we can introduce a universal scaling function of the two-point cor-
relation function of (3.39). We have

C(τ ) = σ z(τ )σ z(0) =

σ

τ Lτ

,

Lτ ξ

,

h˜ Lτ

,

(5.45)

where σ is another universal scaling function, and there is now no nonuniversal additive constant. Again σ is a function of all the independent dimensionless combinations of large lengths; there is no prefactor because the correlator is clearly dimensionless. We can read off the value of σ (y1, y2, 0) by comparing (5.45) with (5.43), but determining the full function (y1, y2, y3) requires knowledge of the lattice correlator in the presence of a nonzero h, which is somewhat tedious to obtain. A simpler method becomes apparent in
the following subsection.

5.5.3 Mapping to a quantum model: Ising spin in a transverse ﬁeld

We show that the statistical mechanics of the Ising chain can be mapped onto the quantum mechanics of a single Ising spin [152, 496]. Further, as stated in the introduction to this chapter, correlators of the quantum spin precisely reproduce the scaling limit of the classical Ising chain.
Let us return to the expressions (5.25) and (5.26) and write the transfer matrices T1, T2 in terms of ratios of “large” to small length scales. We have

T1 = eK (1 + e−2K σˆ x ) ≈ eK (1 + (a/2ξ )σˆ x )

≈ exp(a(−E0 + (1/2ξ )σˆ x )), T2 = exp(ah˜ σˆ z),

5.5 The classical Ising chain

where σˆ x,z are the Pauli matrices in (1.8). Note that both T1,2 have the form eaO , where O is some operator, acting on the | ↑, ↓ states, that is independent of a. Using the fact that eaO1 eaO2 = ea(O1+O2)(1 + O(a2)), we can write (5.25) in the limit a → 0 as
T1T2 ≈ exp(−a HQ),

Z = (T1T2)M ≈ Tr exp(−HQ/T ),

We have introduced the fundamental quantum Hamiltonian HQ. It describes the dynamics
of a single Ising quantum spin, whose Hilbert space consists of the two states | ↑, ↓ , and which is under the inﬂuence of a longitudinal ﬁeld h˜ and a transverse ﬁeld ; it is

the single-site version of (1.7) with an additional longitudinal ﬁeld. Note, from the ﬁrst

relation in (5.47), that the transfer matrix of the classical chain H is the quantum evolution operator e−HQτ over an imaginary time τ = a, the lattice spacing. Thus the transfer from

one site to the next is similar to evolution in imaginary time, and length coordinates for the

classical chain translate into imaginary time coordinates for the quantum model HQ. The energy is also the gap between the ground and excited states of HQ in zero (longitudinal) ﬁeld, and it is precisely equal to the inverse of the correlation length of the classical Ising

chain, as expected from the length to time mapping. Further, the partition function of the

quantum spin is taken at a temperature T that precisely equals the inverse of the total

length of the classical chain. These correspondences between a gap of a quantum system

and a correlation length of the corresponding classical model along the “time” direction,

and between the temperature of the quantum system and the total length of the classical

model, are extremely general and apply to essentially all of the models we consider in this

book.

We can use (5.47) and (5.48) to quickly evaluate the free energy of the quantum spin, F = −T ln Z. The eigenenergies of HQ are E0 ± [( /2)2 + h˜ 2]1/2, and we have

F = E0 − T ln 2 cosh ( /2)2 + h˜ 2/T ,

(5.50)

which agrees precisely with the scaling limit of the classical Ising chain (5.42). Indeed,

the single spin quantum Hamiltonian HQ is precisely the theory describing the universal scaling properties of the entire class of classical Ising chains with short-range interactions.

Statements of this type are often shortened to “HQ is the scaling theory of H .” The correspondence between HQ and H also extends to correlation functions. Let us
deﬁne the time-ordered correlator, C, of HQ in imaginary time by

C(τ1, τ2) =

1 Z

Tr

e−HQ/T σˆ z(τ1)σˆ z(τ2)

The quantum Ising model

where σˆ z(τ ) is deﬁned by the imaginary time evolution under the HQ: σˆ z(τ ) ≡ eHQτ σˆ ze−HQτ .

(5.52)

Now, upon carrying through the mapping described above for the free energy for the case of the correlation function, we ﬁnd that the correlator C above is indeed the same as the classical model correlation function in (3.39), (5.30), and (5.35)

C(τ1, τ2)

(5.53)

where we have emphasized by the subscript that the average on the right-hand side is for the classical model with Hamiltonian H . The time-ordered functions appear in the quantum problem for the same reason we had to assume ≥ in (5.31): as the transfer matrix evolves the system from “earlier” sites to “later” sites, the earlier σˆ z operators appear ﬁrst in the trace.
The representation (5.51) also makes the origin of the mapping between the quantum gap, , and the classical correlation length, ξ , in (5.49) quite clear. We can evaluate (5.51) at T = 0 by inserting a complete set of HQ eigenstates and obtain the general representation

C (τ1, τ2) = | 0|σ z |n |2e−(En−E0)|τ1−τ2|,
n

(5.54)

where |n are all the eigenstates of HQ with eigenvalues En, and |0 is the ground state. For sufﬁciently large |τ1 − τ2|, the sum over n will be dominated by the lowest energy state for which the matrix element is nonzero, and this gives an exponential decay of the correlation

function over a “length” ξ = 1/(E1 − E0) = 1/ . Of course, in the present simple system there are only a total of two states, but this result is clearly more general.

It is quite easy to evaluate (5.51) for HQ, and the direct quantum computation is much simpler than the use of classical mapping in (5.53). We ﬁnd

h˜ C(τ1, τ2) = σ T (τ1 − τ2), T , T ,

(5.55)

where σ is precisely the same scaling function that appeared in (5.45) and can be computed from (5.51) to be

σ (y1, y2, y3) =

4 y32 y22 + 4y32

+

y22 cosh y22 + 4y32

y22 + 4y32(1 − 2|y1|)/2 cosh y22 + 4y32 2

. (5.56)

It can be checked that the y3 = 0 case of this result agrees with the combination of (5.43) and (5.45).

5.6 Mapping of the quantum Ising chain to a classical Ising model

We now move beyond the single-site quantum case, and apply the methods of Section 5.5 to the original quantum Ising model in (5.1). We only consider the case d = 1, D = 2 here;

75

5.6 Mapping of the quantum Ising chain to a classical Ising model

the generalization to higher d is immediate, and does not involve any new subtleties. Our presentation here is the inverse of that in Section 5.5: we begin with the quantum model and derive an equivalent classical model.
As in (5.47), we consider the transfer matrix associated with imaginary time evolution over a short time a. Thus we can write the partition function as

Z = Tr exp (−HI /T ) = Tr (exp (−a HI ))Mτ ,

(5.57)

where, as in (5.38) and (5.49), Lτ = Mτ a = 1/T . Referring to Fig. 2.1, we can view this as the statistical mechanics of a system of Mτ rows in τ direction, with exp −a HQ being the transfer matrix from one row to the next. We have M sites in the quantum model along the x direction, and hence this transfer matrix is 2M × 2M dimensional, much more complex than the simple 2 × 2 transfer matrices we met in Section 5.5.
As in Section 5.5, we are interested here in the limit of a → 0 and Mτ → ∞ at ﬁxed Mτ a = 1/T . The exponential of the original Hamiltonian HI in (5.1) is difﬁcult to evaluate, so let us use the same trick as in (5.47) to write

exp (−a HI ) = T1T2 + O(a2),

(5.58)

where

T1 = exp J ga σˆix , T2 = exp J a σˆizσˆiz+1 .

i

i

(5.59)

The matrix elements of the operators T1 and T2 can be evaluated exactly, and we will do so shortly.
The last remaining step is to insert a complete set of states between each T1T2 term in (5.57). It is convenient to choose these states to be eigenstates of all the σˆiz. Let us denote these states as |{mi } , where mi = ± 1 are the eigenvalues of σˆiz, and there are a total of 2M such states. It is immediately evident that T2 is diagonal in this basis, whereas T1 is not; in particular

T2 |{mi } = exp J a mi mi+1 |{mi } .
i

(5.60)

As in Section 5.5, we label the Mτ time steps in (5.57) by the index , and so we write the corresponding states as |{mi ( )} . Then (5.57) can be written as

Mτ

Z=

{mi ( )}| T1T2 |{mi ( + 1)} .

{mi ( )} =1

(5.61)

Note that the summation above is over the 2M Mτ possible values of mi ( ) = ± 1. So the above expression is starting to look like that for a two-dimensional classical Ising model as in (2.2), with i and the coordinates along the x and τ directions, respectively. The expression for the weights in the partition function does not yet look like that in (2.2). After

76

The quantum Ising model

evaluating the matrix element of T2 using (5.60), we need the following matrix element of T1:

{mi ( )}| T1 |{mi ( + 1)} = {mi ( )}| exp J gaσˆix |{mi ( + 1)} .
i

(5.62)

Note that the right-hand side is a product of terms, each of which only involves the 2 × 2 Ising subspace at site i. Consequently, we can use the analog of the manipulations below (5.26) and (5.46) to derive a useful identity valid for a single Ising spin:

m| exp g J a σˆ x m = A exp Bmm ,

(5.63)

where m, m = ±1 and

A = 1 cosh(2J ga), exp(−2B) = tanh(J ga). 2

(5.64)

The identity (5.63) is easily veriﬁed by evaluating both sides at the four possible values of

m and m .

Collecting the results in (5.60–5.63), we have our main expression for the partition func-

tion of the classical Ising model

⎛

⎞

Z=

exp ⎝ J a mi ( )mi+1( ) + B mi ( )mi ( + 1) ⎠,

{mi ( )}

i,

(5.65)

where we have dropped an overall normalization associated with powers of A. This has precisely the same structure as the Ising model in (2.2), with the only difference that the “exchange” couplings along the x and τ directions are not equal. This was, however, to be expected, because there is no fundamental equivalence between the space and imaginary time directions for the quantum Ising models.
All of our discussion of classical statistical mechanics in Chapters 3 and 4 can now be directly applied to (5.65): the anisotropic couplings do not cause important modiﬁcations to any of the arguments. Thus we obtain a description of the critical point in terms of the D-dimensional ﬁeld theory in (3.25) with an N = 1 component for the ﬁeld φα. The only change appearing from the anisotropic coupling is that the coefﬁcients of the gradient terms along the space and time directions can be different. This ﬁnally maps (3.25) to the d-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory described by the partition function in (2.11) at N = 1: the anisotropy determines the value of the “velocity” c. It is clear now that c can be scaled away by a change of the time or space coordinates, and so does not modify any properties of the theory.
To complete our goal of describing the quantum critical properties of the quantum Ising model (2.2), we now need to analyze the spectrum and correlations of the quantum ﬁeld theory (2.11) for N = 1. We defer this discussion to the end of Chapter 6, where we treat the case of general N . The N > 1 cases will apply to the quantum rotor model, which we also discuss in Chapter 6.

5.1 (a) Perform the standard Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory on the ground state in (1.9) and the ﬁrst excited state (5.7) to obtain the 1/g2 correction to the quasiparticle energy in (5.9). In this perturbation theory, the unperturbed Hamil-
tonian H0 is the ﬁrst term in (5.1), and the perturbation H1 is the second term in (5.1). Note that because of momentum conservation k|H1|k ∝ δkk . Thus the perturbation theory splits into distinct sectors for k. Within each sector, the ﬁrst
excited state is nondegenerate, and so this computation can use nondegenerate
perturbation theory, and not worry about the issues discussed in Section 5.1. The latter issues do becomes important at higher order in 1/g. (b) Compute the value of A in (5.11) to order 1/g. First note that σˆ z(k)|0 has terms of order 1 and of order 1/g in the one-particle sector, and only terms of order 1/g in the three-particle sector. Similarly for H1|k . Consequently, show that all contributions to (5.11) from the three-particle sector are of order 1/g2. By working within the one-particle sector show that

k|σˆ z(k)|0 = 1 + cos k . 2g

(5.66)

A curious feature of the above result is that quasiparticle residue at k = 0 actually increases initially as g is reduced from large values. We expect it to vanish at the quantum critical point (see Chapter 10, and so A has a nonmonotonic approach to the quantum critical point. 5.2 Consider the two-particle subspace described by the N (N − 1)/2 states (5.12) on a d-dimensional lattice. At leading order in 1/g, we may consider the projection of HI onto the two-particle subspace, and ignore all matrix elements to other states. Thus HI only hops the particles between nearest-neighbor sites, with an on-site hard core repulsion. Determine eigenstates of this projected Hamiltonian. This is done by transforming to center-of-mass and relative coordinates, and solving the scattering problem in the relative coordinates; this determines the S matrix. Verify (5.14) in d = 1. 5.3 The questions below refer to the ferromagnetic phase of HI in (5.1) on the square lattice, where g 1, and we can perform perturbation theory in g. The lattice has N sites, and you can assume periodic boundary conditions where needed.
(a) Compute the ground state energy per site to order g2. (b) Compute the ferromagnetic moment N0 = σiz to order g2, where i is any site.
You only need the ground state wavefunction to order g to do this, but you need the normalization to order g2. More precisely, write the ground state wavefunction, |G ↑ as

|G ↑ = (1 + αg2)|all spins up + g β|states with one down spin

+ g2 γ |states with two down spins + · · ·

The quantum Ising model

Argue that to determine N0 to order g2, you need the values of α and β, but do not need to know the value of γ . Determine β by ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, and α by the requirement that the wavefunction is normalized. (c) Find and diagonalize the effective Hamiltonian in the one-particle subspace to order g2. This is the subspace with one ﬂipped spin, and has N states with energy 8J above the ground state at leading order. You should ﬁnd that the effective Hamiltonian involves only local moves of the ﬂipped spin. The effective Hamiltonian has contributions from intermediate states with two or zero ﬂipped spins, and those leading to nonlocal hops of the ﬂipped spin exactly cancel against each other. (d) Find and diagonalize the effective Hamiltonian in the two-particle-bound-state subspace to order g2. This is the subspace with two neighboring ﬂipped spins, and has 2N states with energy 12J above the ground state at leading order.

(6.1)

Our analysis parallels that of the quantum Ising model in Chapter 10. We begin by a perturbative analysis of both phases: the paramagnetic phase at g˜ 1, and the magnetically ordered phase at g˜ 1. We then describe the mapping of the partition function of the quantum rotor model in d dimensions to the classical O(N ) spin model in (2.3) and (3.2). This mapping allows us to address the vicinity of the critical point using the methods of Chapters 3 and 4.
We begin with the perturbative analyses, which are expected to hold on either side of a quantum critical point at g˜ = g˜c, which separates the ordered and the quantum paramagnetic phases. We will see later that g˜c = 0 in d = 1, but g˜c > 0 for d > 1.

6.1 Large-g˜ expansion

The strong-coupling expansion was discussed in [197] and brieﬂy noted in Section 1.4.2. At g˜ = ∞, the exchange term in HR can be neglected, and the Hamiltonian decouples into independent sites and can be diagonalized exactly. The eigenstates on each site are the eigenstates of L2; for N = 3 these are the states of (1.24):

| , m i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , − ≤ m ≤ ,

(6.2)

and have eigenenergy J g˜ ( + 1)/2. The ground state of HR in the large g˜ limit consists of the quantum paramagnetic state with = 0 on every site:

|0 = | = 0, m = 0 i .
i

(6.3)

Compare this with the strong-coupling ground state (1.9) of the Ising model. Indeed, the remainder of the large g analysis of the quantum Ising model in Section 5.2 can be borrowed here for the rotor model, and we can therefore be quite brief. The lowest excited state is a “particle” in which a single site has = 1, and this excitation hops from site to site. An important difference from the Ising model is that this particle is three-fold degenerate, 79

The quantum rotor model

corresponding to the three allowed values m = − 1, 0, 1. The single-particle states are labeled by a momentum k and an azimuthal angular momentum m and have energy

εk,m = J g˜ 1 − (2/3g˜) cos(kμa) + O(1/g˜2) ,
μ

(6.4)

where the sum over μ extends over the d spatial directions. This result is the analog of (5.8). Multiparticle states can be analyzed as in Section 5.2, the only change being that the states and the S-matrices now carry O(N ) indices.

6.2 Small-g˜ expansion

For small g˜, the ground state breaks O(N ) symmetry, and all the nˆ i vectors orient themselves in a common, but arbitrary direction. This is similar to the broken Z2 symmetry of the quantum Ising model in Section 5.3.
Excitations above this state consist of “spin waves,” which can have an arbitrarily low energy (i.e. they are “gapless”). This is a crucial difference from the Ising model in Section 5.3, in which there was an energy gap above the ground state. The presence of gapless spin excitations is a direct consequence of the continuous O(N ) symmetry of HR: we can make very slow deformations in the orientation of nˆ , obtaining an orthogonal state whose energy is arbitrarily close to that of the ground state. Explicitly, for N = 3 and a ground state polarized along (0, 0, 1), we parameterize

nˆ (x, t) = u1(x, t), u2(x, t), 1 − u21 − u22 1/2 ,

(6.5)

where |u1|, |u2| 1. In this limit, the commutation relations (1.21) become

[Lˆ 1, u2] = i, [Lˆ 2, u1] = −i,

(6.6)

i.e. u1, Lˆ 2 and u2, −Lˆ 1 are canonically conjugate pairs. Also, in the limit where u1,2 are small, the rotor momenta are also in the 1, 2 plane, and hence the third component of the rotor angular momentum is negligibly small, Lˆ 3 ≈ 0; so by (1.21), Lˆ 1 and Lˆ 2 are commuting variables. We now insert (6.5) into (6.1), and focus on the long-wavelength
excitations by taking the continuum limit: this yields the Hamiltonian

aλ(k), aλ† (k ) = δλλ (2π )d δd (k − k ), aλ(k), aλ (k ) = 0,

the commutation relations (6.6) are obeyed. Further, the Hamiltonian explicitly displays the simple sum over independent harmonic oscillators

(6.10)

Here the oscillation frequency is

εk = ck, c = J a g˜,

(6.11)

where c is the spin-wave velocity. Thus the excitation spectrum of the magnetically ordered phase consists of two polariza-
tions of quantized spin waves with dispersion εk = ck; for general N , there are N − 1 spin waves. It is useful to recall how quantization of electromagnetic waves led to the concept of a particle-like excitation called the photon: the particle is just a wavepacket. Similarly, here we can interpret the quantized spin waves as a set of N − 1 quantized particles.
The reader should note the distinction between the N − 1 particles in the ordered phase with the N particles obtained in the quantum paramagnet in the strong coupling expansion above. In the ordered phase, rotations about the axis of nˆ do not produce a new state, and so there are only N − 1 independent rotations about axes orthogonal to nˆ that lead to gapless spin-wave modes.
The ground state wavefunction of the magnetically ordered state includes quantum zeropoint motion of the spin waves about the fully polarized state. One consequence of the zero-point motion is that the ordered moment on each site is reduced at order g˜:
