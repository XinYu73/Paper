Abstract

The future of electrochemical energy storage hinges on the advancement of science and technology that enables rechargeable batteries that utilize reactive metals as anodes. With specific capacity more than ten times that of the LiC 6 anode used in present-day lithium-ion batteries, cells based on Li-metal anodes are of particular interest. Effective strategies for stabilizing the anode in such cells are now understood to be a requirement for progress on exceptional storage technologies, including Li–S and Li–O 2 batteries. Multiple challenges—parasitic reactions of Li-metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable and dendritic electrodeposition, and dendrite-induced short circuits—derailed early efforts to commercialize such lithium-metal batteries. Here we consider approaches for rationally designing electrolytes and Li-metal/electrolyte interfaces for stable, dendrite-free operation of lithium-metal batteries. On the basis of fundamental understanding of the failure modes of reactive metal anodes, we discuss the key variables that govern the stability of electrodeposition at the Li anode and propose a universal framework for designing stable electrolytes and interfaces for lithium-metal batteries.

A lithium-metal battery (LMB) consists of three components: a Li-metal anode, a Li-ion-conducting electrolyte separator, and a cathode 1 . Recharging a LMB requires electrodeposition of lithium on to itself, a process that is fundamentally unstable. At low current densities, concentration of electric field lines and preferential transport of ions to rough regions on the electrode surface produce the morphological instability loosely termed dendrites. Meanwhile, at high current densities, depletion of anions in the electrolyte near the anode creates a space charge that drives a hydrodynamic instability termed electroconvection 2 . This electroconvection draws ions away from regions surrounding a growing dendrite and focuses them on the dendrite tip, enhancing dendrite growth. Thus, for quite fundamental physical reasons, recharge of a LMB at either low or high currents produces rough and dendritic deposition of the metal.
