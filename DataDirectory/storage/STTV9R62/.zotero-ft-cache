Abstract

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of arbitrary n -qubit pure quantum states under local unitary (LU) operations are derived. First, an easily computable standard form for multipartite states is introduced. Two generic states are shown to be LU equivalent iff their standard forms coincide. The LU-equivalence problem for nongeneric states is solved by presenting a systematic method to determine the LU operators (if they exist) which interconvert the two states.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.
