Abstract

In this paper we tackle the problem of connecting low-level Fortran programs to high-level Python programs. The difficulties of mixed language programming between Fortran and C are resolved in an almost compiler and platform independent way. We provide a polished software tool F2PY that can (semi-)automatically build interfaces between the Python and Fortran languages and hence almost completely hide the difficulties from the target user: a research scientist who develops a computer model using a high-performance scripting approach.
