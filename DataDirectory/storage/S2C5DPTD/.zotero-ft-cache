Abstract

Using first-principles density functional calculations, we study the electronic and magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic insulating double perovskite compound La 2 NiMnO 6 , which has been reported to exhibit an interesting magnetic field sensitive dielectric anomaly as a function of temperature. Our study reveals the existence of very soft infrared active phonons that couple strongly with spins at the Ni and Mn sites through modification of the superexchange interaction. We suggest that these modes are the origin for the observed dielectric anomaly in La 2 NiMnO 6 .

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

Plotted are the orbital shapes (constant-amplitude surfaces) with lobes of opposite signs colored as black (magenta) and white (cyan), respectively, for Mn (Ni).

The inset shows the displacement of atoms corresponding to the lowest frequency IR-active mode. The angle between the dotted lines connecting the (at the center of the oxygen-octahedra) and (rightmost corner of the cell) is affected by this phonon.
