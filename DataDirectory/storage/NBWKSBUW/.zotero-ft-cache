1 Dielectric Properties of Materials

1.1 Energy Band in Crystals

In crystallography, a crystal structure is a unique arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystalline solid. It describes a highly ordered structure, occurring due to the intrinsic nature of its constituents to form symmetric patterns. The crystal lattice can be thought of as an array of “small boxes” inﬁnitely repeating in all three spatial directions. Such a unit cell is the smallest unit of volume that contains all of the structural and symmetry information to build up the macroscopic structure of the lattice by translation. The crystal structure and symmetry play a role in determining many of its physical properties, such as electronic band structure and optical transparency.
To discuss the behavior of electrons in a crystal, we consider an isolated atom of the crystal. If Z is the atomic number, the atomic nucleus has a positive charge Ze. At a distance r from the nucleus, the electrostatic potential due to the nuclear charge is (in SI units)

V (r)

=

Ze 4𝜋𝜀0r

(1.1)

where 𝜀0 is the permittivity of free space. Since an electron carries a negative charge, the potential energy of an electron at a distance r from the nucleus is

Ep

(r)

=

−eV

(r)

=

(1.2)

V (r) is positive, while Ep(r) is negative. Both V (r) and Ep(r) are zero at an inﬁnite distance from the nucleus. Figure 1.1a,b shows the variation of V (r) and Ep(r), respectively, with r.
We now consider two identical atoms placed close together. The net potential energy of an electron is obtained as the sum of the potential energies due to the two individual nuclei. In the region between the two nuclei, the net potential energy is clearly smaller than the potential energy for an isolated nucleus (Figure 1.2).
The potential energy along a line through a row of equispaced atomic nuclei, as in a crystal, is diagrammatically shown in Figure 1.3. The potential energy between the nuclei is found to consist of a series of humps. At the boundary AB

of the solid, the potential energy increases and approaches zero at inﬁnity, there being no atoms on the other side of the boundary to bring the curve down.
The total energy of an electron in an atom, kinetic plus potential, is negative and has discrete values. These discrete energy levels in an isolated atom are shown by horizontal lines in Figure 1.4a. When a number of atoms are brought close together to form a crystal, each atom will exert an electric force on its neighbors. As a result of this interatomic coupling, the crystal forms a single electronic system obeying Pauli’s exclusion principle. Therefore, each energy level of the isolated atom splits into as many energy levels as there are atoms in the crystal, so that Pauli’s exclusion principle is satisﬁed. The separation between the split-oﬀ energy levels is very small. A large number of discrete and closely spaced energy levels form an energy band. Energy bands are represented schematically by the shaded regions in Figure 1.4b.
The width of an energy band is determined by the parent energy level of the isolated atom and the atomic spacing in the crystal. The lower energy levels are not greatly aﬀected by the interaction among the neighboring atoms and

hence form narrow bands. The higher energy levels are greatly aﬀected by the interatomic interactions and produce wide bands. The interatomic spacing, although ﬁxed for a given crystal, is diﬀerent for diﬀerent crystals. The width of an energy band thus depends on the type of the crystal and is larger for a crystal with a small interatomic spacing. The width of a band is independent of the number of atoms in the crystal, but the number of energy levels in a band is equal to the number of atoms in the solid. Consequently, as the number of atoms in the crystal increases, the separation between the energy levels in a band decreases. As the crystal contains a large number of atoms (≈1029 m−3), the spacing between the discrete levels in a band is so small that the band can be treated as continuous.
The lower energy bands are normally completely ﬁlled by the electrons since the electrons always tend to occupy the lowest available energy states. The higher energy bands may be completely empty or may be partly ﬁlled by the electrons. Pauli’s exclusion principle restricts the number of electrons that a band can accommodate. A partly ﬁlled band appears when a partly ﬁlled energy level produces an energy band or when a totally ﬁlled band and a totally empty band overlap.
As the allowed energy levels of a single atom expand into energy bands in a crystal, the electrons in a crystal cannot have energies in the region between two successive bands. In other words, the energy bands are separated by gaps of forbidden energy.
The average energy of the electrons in the highest occupied band is usually much less than the zero level marked in Figure 1.4b. The rise of the potential energy near the surface of the crystal, as shown in Figure 1.4b, serves as a barrier, preventing the electrons from escaping from the crystal. If suﬃcient energy is imparted to the electrons by external means, they can overcome the surface potential energy barrier and come out of the crystal surface.

1.2 Conductor, Insulator, and Semiconductor
On the basis of the band structure, crystals can be classiﬁed into conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.

1.2.1 Conductors
A crystalline solid is called a metal if the uppermost energy band is partly ﬁlled or the uppermost ﬁlled band and the next unoccupied band overlap in energy as shown in Figure 1.5a. Here, the electrons in the uppermost band ﬁnd neighboring vacant states to move in and thus behave as free particles. In the presence of an applied electric ﬁeld, these electrons gain energy from the ﬁeld and produce an electric current, so that a metal is a good conductor of electricity. The partly ﬁlled band is called the conduction band. The electrons in the conduction band are known as free electrons or conduction electrons.
1.2.2 Insulators
In some crystalline solids, the forbidden energy gap between the uppermost ﬁlled band, called the valence band, and the lowermost empty band, called the conduction band, is very large. In such solids, at ordinary temperatures, only a few electrons can acquire enough thermal energy to move from the valence band into the conduction band. Such solids are known as insulators. Since only a few free electrons are available in the conduction band, an insulator is a bad conductor of electricity. Diamond having a forbidden gap of 6 eV is a good example of an insulator. The energy band structure of an insulator is schematically shown in Figure 1.5b.
1.2.3 Semiconductors
A material for which the width of the forbidden energy gap between the valence and the conduction band is relatively small (∼1 eV) is referred to as a semiconductor. Germanium and silicon having forbidden gaps of 0.78 and 1.2 eV, respectively, at 0 K are typical semiconductors. As the forbidden gap is not very wide, some of the valence electrons acquire enough thermal energy to go into the conduction band. These electrons then become free and can move about under the action of an applied electric ﬁeld. The absence of an electron in the valence band is referred to as a hole. The holes also serve as carriers of electricity. The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor is less than that of a metal but greater than that of an insulator. The band diagram of a semiconductor is given in Figure 1.5c.

1.3 Fermi–Dirac Distribution Function 5

1.3 Fermi–Dirac Distribution Function

The free electrons are assumed to move in a ﬁeld-free or equipotential space. Due to their thermal energy, the free electrons move about at random just like gas particles. Hence these electrons are said to form an electron gas. Owing to the large number of free electrons (∼1023 cm−3) in a metal, principles of statistical mechanics are employed to determine their average behavior. A useful concept is the distribution function that gives the probability of occupancy of a given state by the electrons. The Fermi–Dirac (FD) distribution function can be used to determine the energy distribution of free electrons in a metal. From statistical mechanics, the FD distribution function is found to be

f (E) =

1[ ]

1 + exp E−Ef kB T

(1.3)

where f (E) is the occupation probability of a state with energy E, EF is a characteristic energy (chemical potential) for a particular solid and is referred to as
the Fermi level, T is the absolute temperature, and kB is Boltzmann’s constant (kB = 1.38 × 10−23 J K−1).
At the absolute zero of temperature, that is, at T = 0 K, Eq. (1.3) shows that
f (E) = 1 for E < EF and f (E) = 0 for E > EF. Thus all the energy states below EF are occupied by the electrons, and all the energy states above EF are completely empty. Hence the Fermi energy EF denotes the maximum energy that can be occupied by the electrons at T = 0 K.
At temperatures greater than the absolute zero, f (E) > 0 for E > EF, as shown in Figure 1.6. This means that at a ﬁnite temperature, some of the electrons in the
quantum states below EF acquire thermal energy to move into states above EF. When E = EF, Eq. (1.3) shows that f (E) = 1/2 for T > 0. Thus the Fermi level is
the energy level for which the probability of occupancy is 1/2 for a ﬁnite nonzero
temperature. For most conductors, EF is less than 10 eV. For a pure semiconductor and an insulator, the Fermi level lies near the middle of the forbidden energy
gap, whereas for a conductor, the Fermi level lies within the conduction band
(Figure 1.7a–c).

1.4 Dielectrics
A dielectric material is a substance that is a poor conductor of electricity. On the basis of band structure, the dielectric materials have an energy gap of 3 eV or more. This large magnitude of energy gap precludes the possibility of electrons being excited from the valence band to the conduction band by thermal means. A dielectric is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric ﬁeld. When a dielectric is placed in an electric ﬁeld, electric charges slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions, causing dielectric polarization. Because of dielectric polarization, positive charges are displaced toward the ﬁeld and negative charges shift in the opposite direction. This creates an internal electric ﬁeld that reduces the overall ﬁeld within the dielectric itself. If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarized but also reorient so that their symmetry axis aligns to the ﬁeld. The ideal dielectric material does not exhibit electrical conductivity when an electric ﬁeld is applied. In practice, all dielectrics do exhibit some conductivity, which generally increases with increase in temperature and applied ﬁeld.
The study of dielectric properties is concerned with the storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials. In practice, most dielectric materials are solid. Examples include porcelain (ceramic), mica, glass, plastics, and the oxides of various metals. Dielectrics are employed as insulation for wires, cables, and electrical equipment, as polarizable media for capacitors, in apparatus used for the propagation or reﬂection of electromagnetic waves, and for a variety of artifacts, such as rectiﬁers and semiconductor devices, piezoelectric transducers, dielectric ampliﬁers, and memory elements.
Some liquids and gases can serve as good dielectric materials. Dry air is an excellent dielectric and is used in variable capacitors. Distilled water is a fair dielectric. A vacuum is an exceptionally eﬃcient dielectric. Many of the traditional industrial dielectric materials are still in common use, and they compete well in some applications with newer materials regarding their electrical and mechanical properties, reliability, and cost. For example, oil-impregnated paper is still used for high-voltage cables. Various types of pressboard and mica, often as components of composite materials, are also in use. Elastomers and press-molded resins are also of considerable industrial signiﬁcance. However, synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polytetraﬂuoroethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, polyamide, and polyimide have become important, as has polycarbonate because it can be

1.4 Dielectrics 7
fabricated into very thin ﬁlms. Generally, polymers have crystalline and amorphous regions, increasing crystallinity, causing increased density, hardness, and resistance to chemical attack but often producing brittleness. Many commercial plastics are amorphous copolymers, and often additives are incorporated in polymers to achieve certain characteristics or to improve their workability.

1.4.1 Polarization of Dielectrics
The factors contribute to the polarization of dielectric molecules: the formation of dipole moments and their orientation relatively to the electric ﬁeld. If in a dielectric the molecules forming elementary dipole moments are composed of neutral particles such as atoms, the electric ﬁeld shifts the electric charge of an atomic shell against the direction of ﬁeld and the nucleus is moved in with the ﬁeld. Thus the center of gravity of the positive and negative charges is displaced from the center of the atom, and an “induced dipole moment” is produced, as shown in Figure 1.8a. This part of polarization of molecules is called electronic (Pe). The electronic polarization is independent of temperature, but it is directly proportional to the ﬁeld strength.
If the molecule producing an elementary dipole moment is made of ions of opposite signs, the following process occurs when the dielectric is placed into an electric ﬁeld: the positive ions leave their equilibrium positions and move in the direction of ﬁeld, and the negative ions are displaced against the direction of ﬁeld. This displacement of ions or their groups in a dielectric initiates an ionic polarization (Pi) of molecules, as shown in Figure 1.8b. The ionic polarization is also independent of temperature, but it depends on the binding energy of particles in the molecule and in the lattice of the dielectric.
The asymmetric distribution of charge between diﬀerent atoms in a molecule produces permanent dipole moments in the molecules of a dielectric. Under the action of an electric ﬁeld, these permanent dipoles are rotated into the direction of the ﬁeld and thus contribute to polarization. In this case, we speak about the orientational polarization (Po), as shown in Figure 1.8c. The orientational polarization is dependent on temperature. With increasing temperature, the thermal

8 1 Dielectric Properties of Materials

energy tends to randomize the alignment of the permanent dipoles inside the materials.
In real dielectrics, free charges may exist, which, under the action of an electric ﬁeld, move through the dielectric and are captured by various defects within the dielectric without coming into contact with the electrodes. The free charges then form regions with a surface or a space charge, which in turn produces a dipole moment, also contributing to the polarization of dielectric. This mechanism initiates a space (surface) charge polarization (Ps) inside the dielectric, as shown in Figure 1.8d. Like the orientational polarization, the space charge polarization is also a function of temperature; in most cases it increases with temperature.
The total polarization of a dielectric may simultaneously involve all the four mechanisms. If we assume that they are independent, we can write the total polarization of a dielectric material as the sum of the contributions from the four sources described earlier:

Ptotal = Pe + Pi + Po + Ps

(1.4)

where the subscripts on the right refer to the four types: electronic, ionic, orientational, and space charge polarization.

1.4.2 Dispersion of Dielectric Polarization

The dielectric polarization process can be expressed as a function of temperature:

[

( )]

P(t) = P 1 − exp − t

(1.5)

tr

where P is the maximum polarization attained upon application of the electric
ﬁeld and tr is the relaxation time for a particular polarization process. The relaxation time tr is the time taken for a polarization process to reach 63% of the maximum value.
The relaxation time varies widely with diﬀerent polarization processes. There
are a number of polarization mechanisms as shown in Figure 1.9. The most com-
mon, starting from high frequencies, are given in the following.

1.4 Dielectrics 9
1.4.2.1 Electronic Polarization This process occurs in an atom when the electric ﬁeld displaces the electron density relative to the nucleus it surrounds. Electronic polarization may be understood by assuming an atom as a point nucleus surrounded by spherical electron cloud of uniform charge density. Electrons have very small mass and are therefore able to follow the high-frequency ﬁelds up to the optical range. It is an extremely rapid process and is essentially complete at the instant the voltage is applied. Even when the frequency of the applied voltage is very high in the optical range (∼1015 Hz), the electronic polarization occurs during every cycle of the applied voltage.
1.4.2.2 Ionic Polarization This process is associated with the relative motions of cations and anions in an electric ﬁeld. Ionic polarization is slower than electronic polarization, as the displacement involved here is that of much heavier ion, as compared with the electron cloud. The frequency with which ions can be displaced over a small fraction of the interatomic distance will be of the same order as the lattice vibration frequency (∼1013 Hz). If an electric ﬁeld of frequency in the optical range (∼1015 Hz) is applied, the ions do not respond at all, as the time required by an ion for one vibration is 100 times longer than the period of the applied voltage. So, there is no ionic polarization at optical frequencies.
1.4.2.3 Orientation Polarization It is slower than ionic polarization. The orientation polarization arises from the rotation of molecular dipoles in the ﬁeld. It is easier for the polar molecules to reorient themselves in a liquid as compared with a solid. Orientation polarization occurs when the frequency of the applied voltage is in the audio range.
1.4.2.4 Space Charge Polarization It is the slowest process, as it involves the diﬀusion of ions over several interatomic distances. The relaxation time for this process is related to the frequency of successful jumps of ions under the inﬂuence of the applied ﬁeld. Space charge polarizations are often occur in the kilohertz range or even lower.
1.4.3 Molecular Theory of Induced Charges in a Dielectric
A dielectric contains no free charges; then how it is possible for an induced charge to appear on the surface of a dielectric when placed in an electric ﬁeld? This can be explained by the molecular viewpoint of dielectric. The dielectrics are classiﬁed as polar and nonpolar. A nonpolar molecule is one in which the centers of gravity of positive and negative charges normally coincide, while a polar molecule is one where they do not coincide. Polar molecules therefore have permanent dipole moments. In the absence of an external ﬁeld, these dipoles are oriented at random. But strong ﬁeld orients more dipoles in the direction of the ﬁeld. The charges of a nonpolar molecule suﬀer a small displacement when placed in an electric ﬁeld.
The molecules are said to become polarized by the ﬁeld and are called induced dipoles. So, the dielectrics, both polar and nonpolar, behave in the same way

under the inﬂuence of an external electric ﬁeld. We can imagine that these dipoles in the applied electric ﬁeld can have excess negative charges on one surface and positive charges on the opposite surface as shown in Figure 1.10.
These charges are not free, but each is bound to a molecule lying on or near the surface. The net charge per unit volume within the rest of the dielectric medium is zero. The electric ﬁeld E1 set up by the induced charge always opposes the applied ﬁeld E0. The resultant ﬁeld E is the vector sum of these two. That is,

E = E0 + E1

The ﬁeld E1 is called the depolarization ﬁeld, for within the body, it tends to oppose the applied ﬁeld E0 as shown in Figure 1.10. The resultant ﬁeld E points to the same direction as E0 but is smaller in magnitude. This leads to the conclusion that if a dielectric is placed in an electric ﬁeld, the induced surface charges

appear, which tend to weaken the original ﬁeld within the dielectric. Thus we can

deﬁne the relative dielectric constant or relative permittivity 𝜀 as the ratio of the

magnitude of the applied ﬁeld E0 to the resultant ﬁeld E. Then,

E0 = V0 = 𝜀

(1.7)

EV

where V 0 is the potential diﬀerence without any medium and V is the same with a dielectric medium in between the capacitor plates.

Therefore, for same charges Q, the ratio of capacitance with dielectric C and

capacitance without dielectric (for free space) C0 will be

C = (Q∕V ) = V0 = E0 = 𝜀

(1.8)

C0 (Q∕V0) V E

From the given deﬁnition of 𝜀, the dielectric constant or permittivity for free

space is unity. Obviously 𝜀 is a dimensionless quantity.

1.4.4 Capacitance of a Parallel Plate Capacitor

If a constant voltage V 0 is applied to a plane condenser with a vacuum capacity C0, a charge Q of density 𝜎 = Q/A is set up on the condenser with area A and
distance of separation d between the plates (Figure 1.10). From the application

of Gauss’s law, we know that the electric ﬁeld intensity between two plates with

a vacuum is E = 𝜎/𝜀0.

The potential diﬀerence V 0 is the work done in carrying a unit charge from one

plate to the other. Hence

1.4.5 Local Field in a Dielectric

We now develop an expression for the local ﬁeld at a general lattice site, not necessarily of cubic symmetry. To evaluate Eloc, we must calculate the total ﬁeld acting on a certain typical dipole, this ﬁeld being due to the external ﬁeld as well as all other dipoles in the system. This was done by Lorentz as follows: the dipole is imagined to be surrounded by a spherical cavity whose radius R is suﬃciently large that the matrix lying outside it may be treated as a continuous medium as far as the dipole is concerned (Figure 1.11a). The interaction of our dipole with the other dipoles lying inside the cavity is, however, to be treated microscopically, which is necessary since the discrete nature of the medium very close to the dipoles should be taken into account. The local ﬁeld, acting on the central dipole, is thus given by the sum

Eloc = E0 + E1 + E2 + E3

(1.16)

where E0 is the external ﬁeld; E1 is the depolarization ﬁeld, that is, the ﬁeld due to the polarization charges lying at the external surfaces of the sample; E2 is the ﬁeld due to the polarization charges lying on the surface of the Lorentz sphere

(Figure 1.11b), which is known as Lorentz ﬁeld; and E3 is the ﬁeld due to other dipoles lying within the sphere.
It is important to note that the part of the medium between the sphere and the external surface does not contribute anything since the volume polarization charges compensate each other, resulting in a zero net charge in this region. The contribution E1 + E2 + E3 to the local ﬁeld is nothing but the total ﬁeld at one atom caused by the dipole moments of all the other atoms in the specimen. Dipoles at distances greater than perhaps 10 lattice constants from the reference site make a smoothly varying contribution. It is convenient to let the interior surface be spherical.

1.4.5.1 Lorentz Field, E2 The polarization charges on the surface of the Lorentz cavity may be considered as forming a continuous distribution. The ﬁeld due to the charge at a point located at the center of the sphere is, according to Coulomb’s law, given by

(1.17)

1.4.5.2 Field of Dipoles inside Cavity, E3 The ﬁeld E3 due to the dipoles within the spherical cavity is the only term that depends on the crystal structure. For a reference site with cubic surroundings in

a sphere, E3 = 0 if all the atoms may be replaced by point dipoles parallel to each other. The total local ﬁeld at a cubic site is then

(1.18)

This is known as the Lorentz relation: the ﬁeld acting at an atom in a cubic site

is the macroscopic ﬁeld E of plus 4𝜋P/3 from the polarization of the other atoms

in the specimen.

1.4.6 Molecular Description of Polarization
The interpretation of the polarization vector P describing the electric ﬁeld inside a dielectric as an electric dipole for unit volume enables us to progress from the

1.4 Dielectrics 13

macroscopic to a molecular description of the dielectric. In the molecular concept, the resulting dipole moment p of a unit volume of a dielectric is set up by composing the elementary dipole moments of the smallest aggregates forming the elementary dipoles, which are called molecules of a dielectric.
The elementary dipole moment of a molecule p of a dielectric is thus proportional to the intensity of the local ﬁeld Eloc acting on the molecule:

p = 𝛼Eloc

(1.19)

The constant of proportionality 𝛼 is called the molar polarizability. For a non-

spherical atom, 𝛼 will be a tensor. The polarization of a crystal may be expressed

approximately as the product of the polarizabilities of the atoms times the local

electric ﬁeld:

∑

∑

P = Ni pi = Ni𝛼i Eloc(i)

(1.20)

i

i

where Ni is the concentration, 𝛼i is the polarizability of atoms i, and Eloc(i) is the local ﬁeld at atom sites i.

We want to relate the dielectric constant to the polarizabilities; the result will

depend on the relation that holds between the macroscopic electric ﬁeld and the

local electric ﬁeld. If the local ﬁeld is given by the Lorentz relation (1.18), then

P

=

) Ni𝛼i

(1.21)

The polarization is induced by electric ﬁeld, and therefore it is a function of electric ﬁeld. The relationship is written in the following way:

P = 𝜒E

(1.22)

where 𝜒 is called the dielectric susceptibility. In general 𝜒 is a tensor and depends on the electric ﬁeld. The dielectric constant 𝜀 of an isotropic or a cubic medium relative to vacuum is deﬁned in terms of the macroscopic ﬁeld E:

𝜀 = E + 4𝜋P = 1 + 4𝜋𝜒 E

(1.23)

We solve for P to ﬁnd the susceptibility

This is the Clausius–Mossotti relation. This relates the dielectric constant to

This is the Lorentz–Lorenz equation. It connects the index of refraction with the polarizability.

1.4.7 Dielectrics Losses

When an electric ﬁeld acts on any matter, the latter dissipates a certain quantity of electric energy that transforms into heat energy. This phenomenon is known as the loss of power, meaning an average electric power dissipated in matter during a certain interval of time. As a rule, the loss of power in a specimen of a material is directly proportional to the square of the electric voltage applied to the specimen.
If a metal conductor is ﬁrst connected to direct voltage and then to alternating voltage, the acting magnitude of which is equal to direct voltage, the loss of power P in watts will be the same in both cases in conformity with the Joule–Lenz law and equal to

P = V2 R

(1.27)

where V is the voltage in volts and R is the resistance of the conductor in ohms. As distinct from conductors, most of the dielectrics display a characteristic fea-
ture: under a given voltage, the dissipation of power in the dielectrics depends on the voltage frequency; the expense of power at an alternating voltage is markedly higher than at a direct voltage, rapidly grows with an increase in frequency, voltage, and capacitance, and also depends on the material of the dielectric.
The power losses in a dielectric under the action of the voltage applied to it are commonly known as dielectric losses. This is the general term determining the loss of power in an electrical insulation both at a direct and an alternating voltage. Dielectric losses at a direct voltage can be found from relation (1.27) where R stands for the resistance of the insulation, while the losses under the alternating voltage are determined by more intricate regularities. Actually the dielectric losses mean the losses of power under an alternating voltage.

1.4.7.1 Dielectric Loss Angle The phase diagram of currents and voltages in a capacitor energized by an alternating voltage is shown in Figure 1.12. If the power were not dissipated at all in the dielectric of the capacitor (ideal dielectric), the phase of current I through the capacitor would be ahead of the phase of voltage V by 90∘ and the current

1.4 Dielectrics 15

would be purely reactive. In actual fact, the phase angle 𝜑 is slightly less than 90∘. The total current I through the capacitor can be resolved into two components – active Ia and reactive Ir currents.
Thus, the phase angle describes a capacitor from the viewpoint of losses in a dielectric. Since the phase angle 𝜑 is very close to 90∘ in a capacitor with a high-quality dielectric, the angle 𝛿 (i.e., 𝛿 = 90∘ − 𝜑) is a more descriptive parameter, which is called the dielectric loss angle. The tangent of the angle is equal to the ratio of the active currents to the reactive currents:

tan 𝛿 = Iq∕Ir

(1.28)

or the ratio of active power P (power loss) to the reactive power Pr:

tan 𝛿 = P∕Pr

(1.29)

The dielectric loss angle is an important parameter for the dielectric materials. This parameter is usually described by the loss tangent tan 𝛿. Sometimes the quality factor of an insulation portion is determined, that is, the value reciprocal of the loss tangent:

Q

=

1 tan 𝛿

=

tan 𝜑

(1.30)

The values of tan 𝛿 for the best electrical insulating materials employed

in high-frequency and high-voltage engineering practice are of the order of

thousands and even tenths of thousands of fractions.

1.4.7.2 Total and Speciﬁc Dielectric Losses The value of dielectric losses P in an insulating material having a capacitance C is described from relation (1.27) as

P = V Ia = V Ir tan 𝛿
Inserting the intensity of the capacitive current through an insulation portion with a capacitance of C,

Ir = V 𝜔C

(1.31)

Since 𝜔 = 2𝜋f , the angular frequency, the dielectric losses P can be expressed as

P = V 2𝜔C tan 𝛿 = 2𝜋fCV 2 tan 𝛿

(1.32)

Inserting the value of eﬀective length Λ = A∕d in Eq. (1.32) and replacing 𝜀0 by its numerical value

𝜀0

≈

10−9 36𝜋

F ∕m

the expression of dielectric losses can be formulated as

P = 5.56 × 10−11V 2f Λ𝜀 tan 𝛿

(1.33)

Formulas (1.32) and (1.33) have a broad ﬁeld of application. They hold for any size and shape of an insulated portion.

The knowledge of total amount of dielectric losses in the insulated portion is

not enough, and it is necessary to study the distribution of dielectric losses at the

separate points of insulation. Let us consider a cube with edge dx inside the insu-

lated portion in which we are interested so that the lines of forces pierce the cube

entering and leaving it through two opposite faces in the direction perpendicular

to these faces (Figure 1.13).

The capacitance of the capacitor formed by the cube, according to relation

(1.13) with d = dx and A = (dx)2, is

C

and the voltage across the cube is V = E dx. Inserting these values into Eq. (1.32), we get

dP = E2𝜔𝜀0𝜀 tan 𝛿 (dx)3

(1.34)

where the speciﬁc dielectric losses are the losses per unit volume of the dielectric:

p=

dP dV

=

dP (dx)3

where V = (dx)3 is the volume of the cube. So, the speciﬁc dielectric losses p are expressed as

p = E2𝜔𝜀0𝜀 tan 𝛿

(1.35)

Now substituting 𝜔 = 2𝜋f and replacing 𝜀0 by its numerical value in Eq. (1.35),

𝜀0

≈

10−9 36𝜋

We have the following expression for speciﬁc dielectric losses:

p = 5.56 × 10−11E2f 𝜀 tan 𝛿

Formulas (1.35) and (1.36) are suitable for any pattern of ﬁeld that possesses unlike properties at diﬀerent places. The product 𝜀 tan 𝛿 is called the dielectric loss index (factor).

1.4 Dielectrics 17
1.4.8 Dielectrics Breakdown
At high electric ﬁelds, a material that is normally an electrical insulator may begin to conduct electricity – that is, it ceases to act as a dielectric. This phenomenon is known as dielectric breakdown. The mechanism behind dielectric breakdown can best be understood using band theory.
Essentially, there are two “bands” in every material that the electrons within the material may occupy – the valence band and the higher energy conduction band (Figure 1.14). Electrons in the valence band can be conducted as being bound in place, whereas electrons in the conduction band may act as mobile charge carriers. In dielectrics, the two bands are separated by a certain energy gap Eg, corresponding to the energies that are forbidden to the electrons. Since the valence band is lower in energy, electrons will preferentially occupy this band. Therefore, in a dielectric under normal conditions, the conduction band will be empty. If an electron in the valence band is supplied with energy greater than or equal to Eg, for example, from a high energy photon, it may be promoted to the conduction band.
An electric ﬁeld of suﬃcient strength can supply enough energy to promote many electrons to the conduction band at once. Since electrons in the conduction band act as charge carriers, the material now conducts charge rather than storing it. For each material, there is a characteristic ﬁeld strength needed to cause dielectric breakdown. This is referred to as the breakdown ﬁeld or dielectric strength. Typically values of the dielectric strength lie in the range 106–109 V m−1. The exact value of the dielectric strength depends on many factors – most obviously, the size of the energy gap but also the geometry and microstructure of the sample and the conditions it is subjected to.
The dielectric breakdown is associated with the formation in a dielectric crystal of a conducting path in which the current density is substantially higher than the average for the specimen. The Joule heat generated because of the high-density current in the path leads to the destruction of the material, including melting; the appearance of an air channel as a result of volatilization; and the extensive

formation of crystal defects or cracking. Thus, dielectric breakdown is an irreversible phenomenon. Dielectric breakdown is often associated with the failure of solid or liquid insulating materials used inside high-voltage transformers or capacitors in the electricity distribution grid, usually resulting in a short circuit or a blown fuse. It can also occur across the insulators that suspend overhead power lines, within underground power cables or lines arcing to nearby branches of trees.

Microscopic Properties of Materials
This chapter is an introduction to lattice vibrations – phonons – from a simple microscopic point of view. The basic principles can be set out within a model of a one-dimensional (1D) crystal.

2.1 Phonon
In condensed-matter physics, phonon is a unit of vibrational energy that arises from oscillating atoms within a crystal. Any solid crystal, such as ordinary table salt (sodium chloride), consists of atoms bound into a speciﬁc repeating three-dimensional spatial pattern called a lattice. Because the atoms behave as if they are connected by tiny springs, their own thermal energy or outside forces make the lattice vibrate. This generates mechanical waves that carry heat and sound through the material. A packet of these waves can travel throughout the crystal with a deﬁnite energy and momentum, so in quantum mechanical terms the waves can be treated as a particle, called a phonon. A phonon is a deﬁnite discrete unit or quantum of vibrational mechanical energy, just as a photon is a quantum of electromagnetic or light energy.
Phonons and electrons are the two main types of elementary particles or excitations in solids. Whereas electrons are responsible for the electrical properties of materials, phonons determine such parameters as the speed of sound within a material and how much heat it takes to change its temperature.

2.1.1 One-Dimensional Monatomic Chain

Our model consists of identical atoms connected by springs, shown in Figure 2.1. In equilibrium, the atoms are uniformly spaced at a distance a, and we now look for oscillations about the equilibrium position. We assume that the crystal is harmonic, so that the spring restoring force is linearly dependent upon the extension. Then, if we denote the displacement of the nth atom (which is at the point rn = na) to be un, its equation of motion is

We guess that the solution is a wave of the form

un(t) = u0 cos[qrn − 𝜔(q)t]

(2.2)

Here the wavelength of the wave is 𝜆 = 2𝜋/q, and the period is T = 2𝜋/𝜔(q); to

check that this is a solution and to determine the frequency, we substitute it in

the equation of motion. This is left as an exercise, and a few lines of algebra will

show that the solution Eq. (2.2) exists, provided that

m𝜔2(q) = 2K [1 − cos(qa)] = 4K sin2 ( qa )

(2.3)

√ 𝜔(q) = 2 K

Equation (2.3) is called a dispersion relation – the relation between the fre-

quency of the mode and its wave vector or equivalently the relationship between

the wavelength and the period. The wave vector q is inversely related to the wave-

length; note that for long-wavelength modes (i.e., q → 0), the relationship is linear,

namely,

√

𝜔(q) = K (qa)

(2.5)

m

which is the same as for a wire with tension Ka and density m/a. In the long-wavelength limit, we have compressive sound waves that travel with a velocity v = a(K/m)1/2. Because this kind of wave behaves like a sound wave, it is
generally called an acoustic mode.
The dispersion is not linear for larger values of q and is in fact periodic
(Figure 2.2). The periodicity can easily be understood by reference to Eq. (2.2). Suppose we choose q = 2𝜋/a. Note then that

2𝜋 a

so that all the atoms displace together, just as if q = 0. In general it is straightforward to show that if one replaces q by (q + integer × 2𝜋a), then the displacements are unchanged – so we may simplify our discussion by using only q vectors in the range

This is called the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.

2.1.2 One-Dimensional Diatomic Chain

A 1D chain establishes the basic principles of the dispersion of lattice vibrations in solids, but of course a monatomic chain cannot be turned into a ferroelectric. To explain the microscopic physics behind ferroelectricity, we need at least two atoms in a unit cell, and we will brieﬂy sketch the general principles of the diatomic chain.
For simplicity, we use again a phenomenological model of balls and springs but now with two diﬀerent atoms in the unit cell, two diﬀerent masses, and two diﬀerent spring constants (notice that for the latter to be true, we would need to have the atoms unequally spaced) (Figure 2.3). We can now write down two equations of motion, one for each type of atom:

(2.8)

The solution to this is a little more complicated than before, but we can now intuitively see that there ought to be a new type of phonon mode by considering a particular limit of the parameters. Suppose the two atoms are quite strongly bound together in pairs, as sketched in the previous ﬁgure: then we might expect that K ≫ K′, and to a ﬁrst approximation, the pairs can be treated as independent molecules. (We will also simplify the analysis by taking mA = mB = m.) Then every molecule will have a vibrational mode where the two atoms oscillate out of phase

The corresponding coordinate that undergoes this oscillation is

uopt (q = 0) = uA − uB

(2.10)

where I have explicitly remarked that this is at q = 0 if each molecule undergoes the oscillation in phase with the next. We can of course make a wavelike solution by choosing the correct phase relationship from one unit cell to the next – as sketched in Figure 2.4, but if K′ ≪ K, this will hardly change the restoring force at all, and so the frequency of this so-called optical phonon mode will be almost independent of q.
There are now two branches of the dispersion curve, along one of which the frequency vanishes linearly with wave vector and where the other mode has a ﬁnite frequency as q → 0 (Figure 2.5). The name “optical” arises because at these long wavelengths, the optical phonons can interact (either by absorption or scattering) with light and are therefore prominent features in the absorption and Raman spectra of solids in the infrared spectrum.

2.1.3 Phonons in Three-Dimensional Solids
The given descriptions are not too hard to generalize to three-dimensional solids although the algebra gets overloaded with suﬃces. Rather than a 1D wave vector k corresponding to the direction of the 1D chain, there is now a three-dimensional dispersion relation 𝜔(→−k ), describing waves propagating in diﬀerent directions. Also, there are not just compressional waves but also transverse or shear waves that will have diﬀerent dispersion from the longitudinal (compressional) waves. (These exist in a crystal in any dimension, including our 1D chain where they can be imagined to involve displacements perpendicular to the chain direction.)

2.2 Phase Transition 23
Quite generally, for each atom in the unit cell, one expects to ﬁnd three branches of phonons (two transverse and one longitudinal); always there are three acoustic branches, so a solid that has N atoms in its unit cell will have 3(N − 1) optical modes. And again, each optical mode will be separated into two transverse branches and one longitudinal branch.
2.2 Phase Transition
The physics of structural phase transitions in solids is one of the fundamental problems of modern science. The structural phase transition occurs when the crystal structure of a material is diﬀerent above and below the corresponding phase transition temperature. During such transition, many macroscopic properties of the crystal change drastically, which ﬁnds a lot of practical applications.
Ferroelectric transitions form a subgroup of structural phase transitions. During ferroelectric transition, the structural symmetry is lowered, leading to an appearance of a spontaneous electrical polarization of the crystal (in the absence of an external electric ﬁeld). The corresponding change of the structure involves a displacement of certain ions in the low-temperature ferroelectric phase from the centrosymmetric positions in the high-temperature paraelectric phase.
A useful tool in the study of the theory of phase transition is the model illustrated in Figure 2.6. The model contains an array of atoms linked by harmonic forces with one atom in each unit cell. The model is drawn as a 1D array in Figure 2.6, but it is easily generalized to two or three dimensions.
Each atom “sees” a local double-well potential, which is assumed to represent the rest of the crystal that is missing from the model. At low temperatures, the equilibrium structure has all atoms displaced to one side of their origin or the other. At high temperatures, there is a phase transition to a state where each atom vibrates about its origin. Although this model is clearly a gross simpliﬁcation of what happens in a real crystal, it is actually rather instructive in helping to picture the physical interpretation of the theory and to highlight the issues just raised.
If the potential barrier between the two wells is much higher than the interaction between neighboring atoms, the atoms will reside in one or other of the two wells, even at a temperature well above the transition temperature (Figure 2.7).
At high temperatures (T ≫ Tc), the positions of neighboring atoms are not correlated in any signiﬁcant way. On cooling toward the transition temperature (T > Tc), the eﬀects of nearest-neighbor interactions become more signiﬁcant, and a degree of short-range order is established. Below the transition temperature (T < Tc), the probability that one side of the double-well potential will be occupied is higher, but there is also a signiﬁcant probability that some

atoms will occupy the alternative potential well. At very low temperatures (T ≪ Tc), most of the atoms occupy the same side of the double-well potential.
If the forces between atoms are much larger than the forces due to local potential, the actual height of the potential barrier has nothing to do with the phase transition temperature. At high temperatures, the local potential does not force atoms to sit on one side of the origin or the other. Instead, the atoms vibrate about the origin, and the shape of the double-well potential has little eﬀect other than to modify the phonon frequencies. On cooling toward the phase transition, the eﬀects of the shape of the double-well potential become more important, and atoms begin to spend relatively more time on either side of the origin (Figure 2.8). However, because the forces between neighboring atoms are much stronger, neighboring atoms are displaced from the origins by similar amounts. Below the transition temperature, the mean positions of all the atoms are displaced by the same small amount to one side of the origin, and the size of this displacement increases on further cooling.
At high temperatures (T ≫ Tc), the atoms vibrate about the zero position, and the eﬀects of the double-well potential are not signiﬁcant. On cooling toward the transition temperature (T > Tc), the degree of short-range order

is established where neighboring groups of atoms are temporarily slightly displaced from the origin. Below the transition temperature (T < Tc), the atoms vibrate about the positions that are shifted away from the origin, and all atoms vibrate about the same displaced point. At very low temperatures (T ≪ Tc), all the atoms occupy the same side of the double-well potential.

2.2.1 Soft Mode

In 1960, Cochran proposed the soft mode concept to describe the mechanism of the ferroelectric structural phase transitions [2–4]. This concept is based on assuming that the crystal becomes unstable against a particular normal vibration of the lattice (phonon) whose frequencies tend to zero (soften) if the crystal approaches a structural phase transition on changing the external thermodynamic force (e.g., temperature, pressure, ﬁeld). In the high-temperature phase, there exists a certain unstable phonon (the “soft mode”) whose frequency decreases as the temperature approaches Tc (the phonon “softens”) and reaches zero at Tc. It means that the corresponding lattice vibration becomes “frozen” at this temperature and produces a structure of another symmetry with a ﬁnite dipole moment.
Since the soft modes in ferroelectrics lead to electrical polarization, they are optically active and can be detected by means of optical spectroscopy in the spectra of dielectric permittivity (real and imaginary parts). The behavior of the parameters of the soft mode is governed by three fundamental laws:

• The static dielectric permittivity produced by the soft mode obeys the Curie–Weiss law:

𝜀0 ∼ (T − Tc)−1

• The eigenfrequency 𝜔t of the soft mode follows the Cochran behavior:

𝜔t ∼ (T − T0)1∕2

where T0 is the soft mode condensation temperature. • The static dielectric constant and the soft mode frequency are related via the
Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation

𝜀inf 𝜀0 (T )

=

𝜔2t (T ) 𝜔2L

where 𝜀inf is the high-frequency dielectric constant and 𝜔L is the longitudinal frequency of the corresponding vibration. Normally the phonons that soften exhibit frequencies below 100–200 cm−1 well above the transition temper-
ature. When softening, while approaching Tc, these modes shift to lower frequencies, ﬁnally leaving the range where the conventional infrared spec-
trometers can operate and entering the submillimeter–millimeter wavelength
domain.

At the phase transition, the phonons become highly anharmonic at the precise Brillouin zone point, but the crystal as a whole remains rather harmonic

26 2 Microscopic Properties of Materials
and the thermal expansion anomalies are typically small. Below the phase transition, something must happen to restore the quasi-harmonic character of all lattice vibrations, and this depends on the details of phase transition.
2.2.1.1 Zone-Center Phonons In this case, the optical zone-center phonon softens completely at the phase transition and then hardens again below it, as the system ﬁnds a new dynamical equilibrium around the distorted structure. The periodicity of the structure is unchanged through the phase transition.
2.2.1.2 Zone-Boundary Phonons When the distortion is driven by a zone-boundary phonon, the distorted structure will have a larger unit cell (the translational symmetry is broken). The zone-boundary point will then fold to the new zone center, and the soft phonon will harden below the phase transition to become a new zone-center phonon.
The atomic displacements associated with the soft mode are the same as the deformation of the structure in the low-temperature phase. For example, in the high-temperature phase of PbTiO3, the soft mode involves the Pb+ and Ti+ cations moving along the c-axis in one direction and the O anions moving in the opposite direction [5]. This is the distortion that freezes into the structure in the low-temperature phase. There is a soft mode in the low-temperature phase that corresponds to the same atomic motions but now vibrating about new mean positions. In the case of PbTiO3, the soft mode in the high-temperature phase is degenerate, so two corresponding modes are observed in the low-temperature phase.
2.2.2 Landau Phenomenological Theory of Phase Transition
Lev Davidovich Landau (1908–1968) is one of the great physicists of the twentieth century, who has made the most signiﬁcant contributions on the theory of phase transition. The essential feature of Landau theory is that it is a phenomenological theory. This means that it is not concerned with the details of the interactions at the atomic level that ultimately should govern the behavior of any system. Landau theory is chieﬂy concerned with symmetry – in fact, it only applies to phase transitions entailing a change in symmetry.
The central idea of Landau theory is the construction of a quantity known as Landau free energy F, which describes the energetics of the system in the vicinity of a phase transition. F, which can be usually thought of as an approximation to the Helmholtz or Gibbs free energy per unit volume, is of course a real quantity and depends on temperature, pressure, and any other external parameters, for example, electric or magnetic ﬁeld, stress, etc. The Landau free energy also depends on the order parameters of the system. For instance, in the case of ferroelectrics, the spontaneous polarization P is the order parameter that plays important roles during phase transition. Here, it is assumed that the order parameter is spatially constant quantity, and hence, the spatial ﬂuctuations are neglected. In most ferroelectrics, due to strong dipolar long-range interactions, such simpliﬁcation is possible, that is, P ≠ f (r). This approach is also known as the mean-ﬁeld (MF) approach.

2.2 Phase Transition 27

In a special case of the MF approach also called Landau phenomenological approach (or Landau–Devonshire theory), an additional assumption is made that the free energy density F could be expanded as a series of powers of the order parameters. In the case of a ferroelectric with single-component order parameter, the free energy density F could be expanded to the lowest powers of the order parameter:

where F0 is the free energy density of the disordered (high-temperature) phase, E is the external bias ﬁeld, and the coeﬃcients of expansion a, b, g, h, and so on in

general depend on thermodynamic quantities such as temperature and pressure. In the case of paraelectric phase P = 0 if E = 0 ⇒ g = 0 (linear term in P is for-

bidden), in ferroelectrics with center of inversion, the Hamiltonian is invariant on P → −P transformation, which leads to odd terms being not allowed in F (h = 0).

In this case,

In Eq. (2.12), typically further simpliﬁcation is sometimes made: we neglect

the dependence of parameters on pressure or other thermodynamic quantities,

and for simplicity, we can treat only the ﬁrst coeﬃcient as a linear function of

temperature, that is, a = f (T) = a0(T − T0), where T0 is the Landau parameter temperature. Taking into account these simpliﬁcations, three special cases can

be found for the free energy given in Eq. (2.12).

By solving the equation of state, the order parameter P is obtained. From

Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13), it is obvious that the free energy transforms signiﬁcantly

below the transition temperature from parabolic (single minimum) at T > T0 to a double well from (double minimum) for T < T0 (Figure 2.9).

Above T0, P is small and high-order terms could be neglected, but such

assumption is not possible below T0. The equilibrium solution for T > T0 is thus

Ps ≡ 0, while Ps ≠ 0 for T < T0. In the absence of the external bias ﬁeld (E = 0),

the equation of state becomes

equation of state becomes a cubic equation, which resulted in the nonzero order

The temperature evolutions of the free energy density F as a function of order
parameter P are shown in Figure 2.11. There are no minimums for the F at the
temperature above Tc. A minimum appears positioned already at some distance from P = 0 at the temperature Tc, that is, Ps ≠ 0 at T = Tc. Below the temperature Tc, this minimum is continuously shifted typically toward larger values of Ps. It should be noted that the transition temperature Tc does not anymore correspond to the Landau parameter temperature T0, that is, T0 ≠ Tc; in fact T0 < Tc. At any temperature between Tc and To, the unpolarized phase exists as a local minimum

of the free energy. The most important feature of this phase transition is that the
order parameter jumps discontinuously to zero at Tc. This type of phase transition is usually called a ﬁrst-order or discontinuous transition. Other common
example of this type of transition is solid–liquid transition.
The discontinuous jump of P from zero to some value at Tc shrinks with the increasing strength of the external bias ﬁeld as shown in Figure 2.12. At some
critical value of the external bias ﬁeld Ec, the critical jump of P vanishes, and the discontinuous transition becomes continuous. The thermodynamic point at

which this occurs is called the critical point. For the bias ﬁelds above Ec, the transition is destroyed in the strict sense, and there is only gradual evolution of the order parameter from the high-temperature state toward the low-temperature state, both possessing the same local symmetry. This region in the phase diagram (above Ec) is called the supercritical region.

Let us introduce another useful quantity called susceptibility by exploring the

This can be rewritten as

a𝜒 + 3bP2𝜒 − 1 = 0.

From Eqs. (2.19) and (2.20), we can write

𝜒= 1 a + 3bP2

Close to Tc, P ≈ 0, then we can write 𝜒=1 a

2.2.3 Displacive Phase Transition
The displacive phase transitions involve only small changes (rotation and/translation) of atomic positions, giving rise to the formation of macroscopic polarization inside the crystals. Figure 2.13 describes the displacive phase transition in perovskite family.
One type of displacive phase transition involves rotations of TiO6 octahedra about the [001] axis, as in SrTiO3. The actual atomic displacements are small, and it appears that one unit cell behaves in more or less the same way as every other. Similar examples are CaTiO3 and MgSiO3, where there is octahedral tilt by diﬀerent amounts about all three axes. Another type of displace phase transition is seen in PbTiO3 [5, 9], in which the Pb2+ and Ti4+ cations move oﬀ-center along [001] to generate a ferroelectric phase transition (a phase transition where the small changes in the atomic positions give rise to the formation of a macroscopic dielectric polarization). SrTiO3 also appears to be trying to undergo the same sort of phase transition at a low temperature [10], but quantum eﬀects suppress the transition. These examples are clear enough, but the waters are muddied by the ferroelectric phase transition in BaTiO3 [11, 12]. This example appears at ﬁrst sight to be very similar to PbTiO3, but in this case it seems that the Ti4+ atoms appear to occupy a central site in the high-temperature cubic phase only on average, whereas in practice that site is always a potential-energy maximum. The potential-energy minima for the Ti4+ cations are located away from the central site along the eight ⟨111⟩ directions, so that in the high-temperature phase, the Ti4+ cations hop among the eight diﬀerent sites. The ferroelectric phase transition occurs when the Ti4+ cations begin to lie preferentially in the sites in the positive

32 2 Microscopic Properties of Materials
c direction. There are still four of these, so there are subsequent phase transitions on further cooling until the Ti4+ cations all occupy the same site in the unit cell.
2.2.4 Order–Disorder Phase Transition
The order–disorder transitions proceed when atoms in a previously random alloy become ordered on speciﬁc crystallographic sites, yielding (usually) a large unit cell. A model to describe this transformation was developed by Bragg and Williams in a series of papers [13–15].
The ordering and its complementary arrangement of phase separation can be understood using the following considerations [13]; let us consider an alloy that consists of two types of atoms, say, A and B. In the alloy, as the following schematic indicates, there are three types of bonds that exist between the two types of atoms, namely, A–A, B–B, and A–B (Figure 2.14).
Let the interaction energies or the bond strengths for these three types of bonds be given, respectively, by EAA, EBB, and EAB. Then, if 2EAB − EAA − EBB < 0, it is preferable for the A(B) atoms to be surrounded by B(A) atoms, which leads to ordering. On the other hand, if 2EAB − EAA − EBB > 0, then it is preferable for the A(B) atoms to be surrounded by other A(B) atoms, which leads to phase separation.
However, this tendency to order is spoiled by the conﬁgurational entropy, which prefers random arrangement of atoms at all lattice points with no speciﬁc preference at all; as temperatures increase, the contribution of the entropy to the free energy increases, and hence, an alloy that orders at low temperatures will become a random, substitutional solid solution at high temperatures.
Bragg and Williams discuss the structure of some of the ordered alloys known to them using primarily the X-ray experiments. The ordered alloy crystal structures of Fe3Al and Cu3Au are shown in Figure 2.15. Bragg and Williams are probably the ﬁrst to consider the kinetics of order–disorder transformations, based on the idea of the competition between two opposing tendencies – the ordering one from the point of view of lowering of potential energy and the randomizing one from the point of view of conﬁgurational entropy.

The crucial idea behind the model of Bragg and Williams is the introduction of an auxiliary parameter (known as the order parameter) to describe the degree of order in the alloy at various temperatures; the free energy of the system is then described in terms of this order parameter; ﬁnally, the equilibrium of the system is determined by minimizing the free energy with respect to the order parameter. More speciﬁcally, the order parameter gives the probability of occupation of the given sites at the given temperature. In more complex ordered structures, more than one order parameter is needed to carry out the analysis.
The order–disorder theory will be applied to ferroelectric materials containing permanent dipoles. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the dipoles have no induced dipole attributes. The polarization in these permanent dipole materials occurs through the alignment of a number n of the dipoles in some appropriate direction. The extreme possibility is that all the dipoles may be oriented in one direction, a state of perfect order if the dipoles are identical. As an appropriate treatment, the dipole translational positions may be taken to be ﬁxed. It is their relative orientations that are to be examined. The materials in which we are interested have easy directions for the polarization. These directions are determined by factors other than the dipole–dipole forces. It is usually convenient to deal with dipole orientations 𝜃 relative to these special lattice directions rather than with orientations relative to one another.
A case that can be treated simply is one in which all the N permanent dipoles p0 are identical and in which there is only one easy direction; two orientations of the permanent dipole are possible. When the N dipoles are all parallel to one of the two easy orientations, a state of perfect order exists. A long-range order parameter appropriate to this case may be deﬁned by L = (n − na)/N where n is the number of aligned dipoles and na is the number of antiparallel dipoles. The parameter L may be otherwise written as

L = 2n − N N

(2.24)

The polarization P is directly related to this, being given by

P = np0 − (N − n)p0 = (2n − N)p0

That is, the polarization is proportional to L; P/Np0 = L. The long-range order parameter is therefore very signiﬁcant for the permanent dipole ferroelectrics, because in these materials there must exist a “spontaneous” long-range order.
The parameter L takes values from zero at complete disorder to unity at complete order. The condition L = −1 is another state of complete order, corresponding to P = −Np0. The condition L = 1 corresponds to n = N, all dipoles being aligned. In the other state of complete order, L = −1, all dipoles pointing in the opposite direction. Figure 2.16a,b each represents a state of complete order. The condition of complete disorder, L = 0, corresponds to n = 1 N, in which half

of the dipoles are antiparallel.

3 Pyroelectricity and Piezoelectricity

3.1 Introduction

The macroscopic electromagnetic properties of matter are commonly described by specifying the current density J, electric displacement D, and magnetic induction B as functions of the electric and magnetic intensities E and H. In the majority of substances, these relations are found to be linear, leading to the deﬁnitions of the conductivity, dielectric constants, and permeability tensors. The meaning of the word “linear” must be made more precise as soon as we consider time-varying ﬁelds. In particular, we must be careful to distinguish between nonlinearity and dispersion. The simple statement that D(t) is proportional to E(t) will not do; by common usage, it is understood that linearity is concerned with such a proportionality in the frequency domain rather in the time domain. By linearity we mean that the material is characterized by some unique function 𝜀(𝜔) such that

D(𝜔) = 𝜀(𝜔) ⋅ E(𝜔)

(3.1)

Thus, a linear dielectric material is characterized by the following conditions:

1) No frequencies are present in D(t), which is not present in E(t). 2) If E1(t) produces D1(t), which we write as E1 → D1 and E2 → D2, then
(a1E1 + a2E2) → (a1D1 + a2D2).
We denote as “nonlinear” only those materials in which there are substantial and easily demonstrable eﬀects arising from violation of condition 1 or 2, occurring at easily produced ﬁeld strengths. Each such substance is potentially capable of important technical applications in various electrical engineering and radio-electronic devices. The nonlinear dielectrics include ferroelectrics whose permittivity varies appreciably with a change in the intensity of the electric ﬁeld and temperature. The piezoelectric materials generate electric charges under the action of mechanical stress and conversely change their dimensions under the action of an electric ﬁeld. The electrets can be regarded as electrical analogs of permanent magnets because they are capable of preserving an electric charge for a long time.

38 3 Pyroelectricity and Piezoelectricity

3.2 Pyroelectricity

Pyroelectricity (from the Greek pyr, ﬁre and electricity) is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric polarization when they are heated or cooled [1]. Alternatively, if a spontaneous polarization is already present, a change of temperature alters it. The change in temperature modiﬁes the positions of the atoms slightly within the crystal structure, such that the polarization of the material changes. This polarization change gives rise to an electric polarization across the crystal. If the temperature stays constant at its new value, the pyroelectric polarization gradually disappears due to leakage current (the leakage can be due to electrons moving through the crystal, ions moving through the air, current leaking through a voltmeter attached across the crystal, and so on) [1].
To observe pyroelectricity, we can heat a crystal uniformly and observe the change in polarization. This experiment can be performed in two diﬀerent ways: either the shape and size of the crystal can be held ﬁxed during the heating or, alternatively, the crystal may be released so that thermal expansion can occur quite freely. The magnitude of the eﬀect observed in the two experiments would be diﬀerent. In the ﬁrst case, with the crystal clamped, the eﬀect observed is called primary pyroelectricity. In the second case, with free expansion, which is much easier to achieve experimentally, there is an additional eﬀect called secondary pyroelectricity; what is observed in this case is the primary eﬀect plus the secondary eﬀect.
In a pyroelectric crystal, a homogeneous change of temperature ΔT induces a polarization change ΔP determined by the relation

ΔP = kΔT

(3.2)

where the vector k is called the pyroelectric vector and is determined by the properties of the pyroelectric. According to Neumann’s principle, the vector k must reproduce the symmetry of crystal point groups and must be zero for point groups with a center of symmetry. Moreover, k must be parallel to the signiﬁcant axis of the crystal, that is, to the axis that does not vary by any operation of symmetry. Any signiﬁcant axis is simultaneously a polar axis of the crystal.

3.2.1 Crystal Classes
All crystal structures can be divided into 32 crystal classes, according to the number of rotational axes and reﬂection planes they exhibit that leave the crystal structure unchanged. Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric. Any dielectric material develops a dielectric polarization (electrostatics) when an electric ﬁeld is applied, but a substance that has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a ﬁeld is called a polar material. Whether or not a material is polar is determined solely by its crystal structure. Only 10 of the 32 point groups are polar. All polar crystals are pyroelectric, so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes.
Pyroelectric crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm In a typical demonstration of pyroelectricity, the whole crystal is changed from one temperature to another, and the result is a temporary voltage across the

3.3 Piezoelectricity 39
crystal. Although artiﬁcial pyroelectric materials have been engineered, the eﬀect was ﬁrst discovered in minerals such as tourmaline. The pyroelectric eﬀect is also present in both bone and tendon. Very small changes in temperature can produce an electric potential due to a material’s pyroelectricity. Passive infrared sensors are often designed around pyroelectric materials, as the heat of a human or an animal from several feet away is enough to generate a diﬀerence in charge.
3.2.2 History
The ﬁrst reference to the pyroelectric eﬀect is in the writings by Theophrastus in 314 BC, who noted that lyngourion could attract sawdust or bits of straw [2]. Tourmaline’s properties were rediscovered in 1707 by Schmidt, who noted that the stone attracted only hot ashes, not cold ones [3]. In 1717 Louis Lémery noticed, as Schmidt had, that small scraps of nonconducting material were ﬁrst attracted to tourmaline but then repelled by it once they contacted the stone [4]. In 1747 Linnaeus ﬁrst related the phenomenon to electricity (he called tourmaline Lapidem Electricum, “the electric stone”) [5], although this was not proven until 1756 by Aepinus [6]. Research in pyroelectricity became more sophisticated in the nineteenth century. In 1824 Brewster gave the eﬀect the name it has today [7]. Both Thomson [8] and Voigt [9] helped develop a theory for the processes behind pyroelectricity.
Progress has been made in creating artiﬁcial pyroelectric materials, usually in the form of a thin ﬁlm, out of gallium nitride (GaN), cesium nitrate (CsNO3), polyvinyl ﬂuorides, derivatives of phenylpyridine, and cobalt phthalocyanine. Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) is a crystal exhibiting pyroelectric properties that has been used to create small-scale nuclear fusion (“pyroelectric fusion”) [10]. A pyroelectric can be repeatedly heated and cooled (analogously to a heat engine) to generate usable electrical power. Possible advantages of pyroelectric generators for generating electricity (as compared with the conventional heat engine plus electrical generator) include potentially lower operating temperatures, less bulky equipment, and fewer moving parts [11].
3.3 Piezoelectricity
The piezoelectric eﬀect was discovered in 1880 by the French physicists Pierre Curie and Paul-Jean Curie; it is the appearance of electric charges on the surfaces of some crystals when they are acted upon by external mechanical stress [12]. Crystalline substances that display a piezoelectric eﬀect are called piezoelectrics.
The piezoelectric eﬀect is understood as the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in solid materials [13]. It also exhibits the reverse piezoelectric eﬀect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical ﬁeld). The nature of the piezoelectric eﬀect is closely related to the occurrence of electric dipole moments in solids. The latter may either be induced for ions on crystal lattice sites with asymmetric charge surroundings or may directly be carried by molecular groups. The dipole density or polarization may easily be calculated for crystals by summing up the

40 3 Pyroelectricity and Piezoelectricity

dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic unit cell. As every dipole is a

vector, the dipole density P is a vector ﬁeld. Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains. The domains are usually randomly oriented but can be aligned using the process of poling, a process by which a strong

electric ﬁeld is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures. Not all piezoelectric materials can be poled.
Of decisive importance for the piezoelectric eﬀect is the change of polarization

P when applying a mechanical stress. This might be caused either by a reconﬁguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by reorientation of molecular dipole moments under the inﬂuence of the external stress. Piezoelectricity may

then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on (i) the orientation of P within the crystal, (ii) the crystal symmetry, and (iii) the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a

variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, that is, as a variation of the electrical ﬁeld extending between the faces, since the units of surface charge density and polarization are the same. However, piezoelectricity is not caused by

a change in charge density on the surface but by dipole density in the bulk. The polarization vector Pi is related to the stress tensor 𝜎jk by the linear equation

Pi = dijk𝜎jk

(3.3)

The quantities dijk, known as piezoelectric moduli, constitute a tensor of the third order having 33 = 27 components. Since the stress tensor is symmetric and
dijk = dikj, relation 3.3 can be abbreviated to a matrix form (Pi = dij𝜎j, where i = 1 − 3 and j = 1 − 6), which is more useful and simpler for both calculation and
consideration:

The matrix elements dij, which are used more often than the tensor elements dijk, are also called piezoelectric moduli. According to classical theory, 18 piezoelectric moduli are necessary to describe piezoelectric properties. Their
number decreases with the increasing symmetry of the crystal. Of the 32 crystal
classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric (not having a center of symmetry), and of

these, 20 exhibit direct piezoelectricity (the 21st is the cubic class 432). Ten of

these represent the polar crystal classes, which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical stress due to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment associ-

ated with their unit cell and which exhibit pyroelectricity. If the dipole moment

can be reversed by the application of an electric ﬁeld, the material is said to be ferroelectric:

• Polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4 mm, 3, 3m, 6, 6 mm • Piezoelectric crystal classes: 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, 4, 422, 4 mm, 42m, 3, 32, 3m,
6, 6, 622, 6 mm, 62m, 23, 43m

3.3 Piezoelectricity 41

For polar crystals, for which P ≠ 0 holds without applying a mechanical load, the piezoelectric eﬀect manifests itself by changing the magnitude or the direction of P or both. For the nonpolar but piezoelectric crystals, on the other hand, a polarization P diﬀerent from zero is only elicited by applying a mechanical load. For them the stress can be imagined to transform the material from a nonpolar crystal class (P = 0) to a polar one, having P ≠ 0.
For the converse piezoelectric eﬀect, strain 𝜀 is related to electric ﬁeld E. The matrix form of the converse coeﬃcient dij (electrostriction coeﬃcients) is the transpose of the direct eﬀect matrix:

𝜀i = dijEj

3.3.1 A Brief Historical Survey
Piezoelectricity is found in useful applications such as the production and detection of sound, generation of high voltages, electronic frequency generation, microbalances, and ultraﬁne focusing of optical assemblies. It is also the basis of a number of scientiﬁc instrumental techniques with atomic resolution, the scanning probe microscopies such as STM, AFM, MTA, and SNOM, and everyday uses such as acting as the ignition source for cigarette lighters and push–start propane barbecues.
The ﬁrst practical application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, ﬁrst developed during World War I. In France, in 1917, Paul Langevin and his coworkers developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector consisted of a transducer, made up of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates and a hydrophone to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency chirp from the transducer and measuring the amount of time it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing oﬀ an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.
The use of piezoelectricity in sonar and the success of that project created intense development interest in piezoelectric devices. Over the next few decades, new piezoelectric materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.
Piezoelectric devices found applications in many ﬁelds. Ceramic phonograph cartridges simpliﬁed player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper to maintain and easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in ﬂuids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic

42 3 Pyroelectricity and Piezoelectricity
time-domain reﬂectometers (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reﬂections from discontinuities) could ﬁnd ﬂaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.
During World War II, independent research groups in the United States, Russia, and Japan discovered a new class of synthetic materials, called ferroelectrics, which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop barium titanate and later lead zirconate titanate (PZT) materials with speciﬁc properties for particular applications.
3.3.2 Piezoelectric Materials
Many materials, both natural and synthetic, exhibit piezoelectricity:
Naturally occurring crystals: Berlinite (AlPO4), sucrose (table sugar), quartz, Rochelle salt, topaz, and tourmaline-group minerals.
Synthetic crystals: Gallium orthophosphate (GaPO4) and langasite (La3Ga5SiO14) are quartz analogic crystal.
Synthetic ceramics: The family of ceramics with perovskite or tungsten bronze structures exhibits piezoelectricity. These materials are barium titanate (BaTiO3), lead titanate (PbTiO3), PZT, potassium niobate (KNbO3), lithium niobate (LiNbO3), lithium tantalate (LiTaO3), sodium tungstate (Na2WO3), zinc oxide (ZnO), Ba2NaNb5O5, and Pb2KNb5O15.
Lead-free piezoceramics: Recently, there is growing concern regarding the toxicity in lead-containing devices driven by the result of restriction of hazardous substances directive regulations. To address this concern, there has been a resurgence in the compositional development of lead-free piezoelectric materials. These materials are sodium potassium niobate ((K,Na)NbO3), bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3), sodium niobate (NaNbO3), bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12), and sodium bismuth titanate (Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3).
Nanomaterials: Over the past few years, the synthesis of piezoelectric nanosized materials such as wires, rods, ﬁbers from zinc oxide [14], PZT [15], cadmium sulﬁde [16], barium titanate [17], and gallium nitride [18] has created a strong research interest among the scientiﬁc community. These one-dimensional piezoelectric nanostructures convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Among various piezoelectric materials studied for the nanogenerator, many of the researches have been focused on the materials with wurtzite structure such as ZnO, CdS, and GaN. The greatest advantage of these materials arises from the facile and cost-eﬀective fabrication technique, hydrothermal synthesis. Since the hydrothermal synthesis can be conducted in a low-temperature environment under 100 ∘C in addition to vertical and crystalline growth, these materials can be integrated in various substrates with reduced concern for their physical characteristics such as melting temperature. Endeavors for enhancing the piezoelectricity of the individual nanowire also led to the development of other piezoelectric materials based on wurtzite structure. Wang et al. introduced p-type ZnO nanowire [19]. Unlike the n-type semiconductive nanostructure, the mobile particle in p-type is a hole; thus the Schottky behavior is reversed from that of n-type case; the electrical signal is generated from the portion of the nanostructure where the holes

3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials 43
are accumulated. It is experimentally proven that p-type ZnO nanowire can generate the output signal nearly 10 times that of n-type ZnO nanowire. From the idea that a material with a perovskite structure is known to have more eﬀective piezoelectric characteristic compared with that with a wurtzite structure, barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanowire has been also studied by Yu et al. [17]. The output signal is found to be more than 16 times that from a similar ZnO nanowire. However, PZT nanoﬁbers prepared by an electrospinning process exhibit an extremely high piezoelectric voltage constant (g33, 0.079 V m N−1), high bending ﬂexibility, and high mechanical strength [15]. Therefore, utilizing PZT nanoﬁbers in energy-harvesting technology could provide a new way to make a portable, ﬂexible, and highly eﬃcient device with a low-frequency vibration nature, since the nanoﬁbers could be woven into fabrics and made into composites.
3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials
During the past decades, piezoelectric materials made huge progress in entering commercial mass markets throughout all branches. Currently, manufacturing industry is the largest application market for piezoelectric devices, followed by the automotive industry. Especially in transportation industry, they found numerous ﬁelds of applications. The development of piezoelectric actuators for fuel injection systems is a popular application of the near past, active noise and vibration reduction is a current activity, and the use of piezoelectric materials for energy harvesting in vibrating structures is one possible future trend. Strong demand also comes from medical instruments as well as information and telecommunications. Piezoelectric nanodevices (generators and motors) are expected to be applied for various applications such as energy harvesting, micro motion applications in mobile phone cameras, and implantable drug pumps. Using piezoelectric materials, a number of devices have been designed, and some of them are described as follows.
3.4.1 Gas Lighter
A gas lighter is a device that is used to ignite a gas stove. It is used in gas stoves that do not have automatic ignition systems (Figure 3.1). It uses a physical phenomenon called piezoelectric eﬀect to generate an electric spark that ignites the combustible gas from the stove burner. The phenomenon of piezoelectric eﬀect can be brieﬂy explained as follows: when pressure is applied along one axis of a crystal (mechanical axis), a potential diﬀerence develops across the transverse axis (electrical axis) of the crystal. The crystals that exhibit such property are called piezoelectric crystals. Tourmaline and quartz are some well-known piezoelectric crystals.
The gas lighter is mostly cylindrical in shape and consists of a piezoelectric crystal over which a spring-loaded hammer is placed. The hammer and spring setup is attached to a button. When this button is pressed, the hammer is moved away from the piezoelectric crystal. When the button is pressed over a limit, the

44 3 Pyroelectricity and Piezoelectricity

Mechanical shock is converted to electricity

Figure 3.1 Piezoelectric gas lighter [20].

Piezoelectric element Gas

spring releases the hammer. The hammer hits the piezoelectric crystal. Due to piezoelectric eﬀect, a high voltage is generated in the range of 800 V. The lighter is wired in such a way that this whole voltage is applied in a small region of air gap between two metallic points. Due to high voltage generated, the air is ionized and acts as a path for the discharge. This electric discharge is the spark that when exposed to the combustible gas from the stove ignites it to produce ﬂame. In gas lighters, piezoelectric ceramics like lead zirconate titanate also known as PZT are used due to their low cost and high sensitivity.
3.4.2 Piezoelectric Sensors
The principle of operation of a piezoelectric sensor is that a physical dimension, transformed into a force, acts on two opposing faces of the sensing element. Depending on the design of a sensor, diﬀerent “modes” to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal, and shear.
Detection of pressure variations in the form of sound is the most common sensor application, for example, piezoelectric microphones (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric pickups for acoustic–electric guitars. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a contact microphone.
Piezoelectric sensors especially are used with high-frequency sound in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and also industrial nondestructive testing (NDT). For many sensing techniques, the sensor can act as both a sensor and an actuator – often the term transducer is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices exhibit this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric as shown in Figure 3.2.
The principle of ultrasonic imaging is based on the pulse echo mode of operation. The transducer is exited by an electrical signal, which in turn produces a vibrational pulse in the medium to be interrogated (in this case the body). If the ultrasonic wave encounters an impedance in the direction of propagation, part of the energy is reﬂected back toward the transducer. This reﬂected echo produces a voltage signal that is used to generate the image of the internal organs and tissues in the body. The acoustic impedance diﬀerence from one tissue to another

is small, so the vibrational pulse penetrates to larger depths and achieves a good imaging capability.
3.4.3 Piezoelectric Actuator
When electricity ﬂows through a piezoelectric material, it creates a physical deformation that is proportional to the applied electric ﬁeld, known as indirect piezoelectric eﬀect (Figure 3.3). A piezoelectric actuator converts an electrical signal into a precisely controlled physical displacement (stroke). This precise deformation can be used to position objects with extreme accuracy, almost at micrometer accuracy.
Piezoelectric actuators are used in loudspeakers, piezoelectric motors, acceleration sensors, vibration sensors, and so on and can be used to create either rotational or linear motion. The strokes of these actuators can also be ampliﬁed if required, because direct strokes from these piezoelectric actuators are generally less than 100 μm. There are two types of piezo actuators: stack actuators and stripe actuators.
3.4.3.1 Stack Actuator The stack actuators are made up of two or several composite structures glued together (Figure 3.4). The purpose of stacking is to obtain more displacement than can be achieved by a single actuator. Based upon the user’s requirements, stack actuators can be either discrete or co-ﬁred.

Both the discrete and co-ﬁred stacks can be insulated with a coating material – a bare stack – or encased in stainless steel when protection from mechanical stress and environmental extremes is needed.

3.4.3.2 Stripe Actuator A stripe actuator, also called a bending actuator, is designed to produce a relatively large mechanical deﬂection in response to an electrical signal (Figure 3.5). This deﬂection oﬀers a large stroke and a very limited blocking force when compared to a stack actuator.
In a stripe actuator, two thin layers of piezoelectric ceramic are bonded together, usually with the direction of polarization coinciding, and are electrically connected in parallel. When electrical input is applied, one ceramic layer expands and the other contracts, causing the actuator to ﬂex.

3.4.3.3 Piezoelectric Actuator Applications The piezoelectric actuator is used in a variety of industrial, automotive, medical, aviation, aerospace, and consumer electronics applications. Piezo actuators are found in precision knitting machinery and braille machines. The silent drive characteristics make piezo actuators an excellent autofocusing mechanism in

3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials 47
microphone-equipped video cameras and mobile phones. Finally, since piezo actuators require no lubrication to operate, they are used in cryogenic and vacuum environments.
Using a stack actuator, extremely ﬁne, virtually inﬁnite resolution is possible with very high voltages corresponding to minute movements of expansion. A piezo actuator can operate billions of times without wear or deterioration. Its response speed is exceptional, and it is limited only by the inertia of the object being moved and the output capability of the electronic driver. When operating in an energized state, a piezo actuator consumes virtually no power and generates very little heat.
3.4.4 Piezoelectric Transformer
The piezoelectric transformer is a combination of piezoelectric actuator and piezoelectric transducer. It is an electrical energy transmission device that contains no conventional magnetic elements and that functions via the electromechanical coupling between the adjacent piezoelectric actuator and the transducer. Due to their special characteristics, in the past few decades, piezoelectric transformers have been developed and used widely in many applications, such as DC/DC converter and electronic ballast for ﬂuorescent lamps. Both piezoelectric actuator and piezoelectric transducer are made up of piezoelectric elements. Generally, piezoelectric elements can work in either longitudinal mode or transverse mode with a corresponding resonant frequency. In the longitudinal mode, the direction of the mechanical stress T is parallel to the electric or polarization direction P, with a corresponding resonant frequency, as shown in Figure 3.6a. In the transverse mode, the direction of the mechanical stress T is perpendicular to the electric or polarization direction P, with a corresponding resonant frequency, as shown in Figure 3.6b. A piezoelectric element can work as either a piezoelectric actuator or a piezoelectric transducer.
Instead of the magnetic ﬁeld coupling that occurs between the primary and secondary windings in a conventional magnetic core transformer, piezoelectric transformer transfers electrical energy via electromechanical coupling between the primary and secondary piezoelectric elements for step-up or step-down voltage conversion. At present, there are three main piezoelectric transformer categories: Rosen [26–28], thickness vibration mode [29], and radial vibration mode [30], shown in Figures 3.7–3.9, respectively.

In the 1950s, Dr. Rosen invented the Rosen piezoelectric transformer (Figure 3.7). It is a combination of a transverse mode piezoelectric actuator (primary side) and a longitudinal mode piezoelectric transducer (secondary side). Because of the inherent high voltage gain associated with the Rosen piezoelectric transformer, it is often referred to as high-voltage piezoelectric transformer. One application in which the Rosen piezoelectric transformer is well suited is to drive high-voltage lamps such as the cold cathode ﬂuorescent lamps used as the backlight source for ﬂat panel displays of notebook computers.
In the 1990s, the thickness vibration mode piezoelectric transformer was developed by NEC of Japan (Figure 3.8). It is a combination of a longitudinal mode piezoelectric actuator (primary side) and a longitudinal mode piezoelectric transducer (secondary side). The thickness vibration mode piezoelectric transformer is also known as the low-voltage piezoelectric transformer because of its inherent low voltage gain. Its present applications include DC/DC converter and adapter applications.
The radial vibration mode piezoelectric transformer, developed by FACE Electronics, United States, in 1998, is a combination of a transverse mode piezoelectric actuator (primary side) and a transverse mode transducer (secondary side) as shown in Figure 3.9. This piezoelectric transformer can be utilized in

3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials 49
such applications as DC/DC converters, adapters, and electronic ballasts for linear/compact ﬂuorescent lamps.
3.4.5 Accelerometer
A piezoelectric accelerometer is an accelerometer that employs the piezoelectric eﬀect of certain materials to measure dynamic changes in mechanical variables (e.g., acceleration, vibration, and mechanical shock). Piezoelectric accelerometers convert one form of energy into another and provide an electrical signal in response to a quantity, property, or condition that is being measured. Using the general sensing method upon which all accelerometers are based, acceleration acts upon a seismic mass that is restrained by a spring or suspended on a cantilever beam and converts a physical force into an electrical signal. Before the acceleration can be converted into an electrical quantity, it must ﬁrst be converted into either a force or a displacement. This conversion is performed via the mass spring system shown in Figure 3.10a,b.
When a physical force is exerted on the accelerometer, the seismic mass loads the piezoelectric element according to Newton’s second law of motion (F = ma). The force exerted on the piezoelectric material can be observed in the change in the electrostatic force or voltage generated by the piezoelectric material. This diﬀers from a piezoresistive eﬀect in that piezoresistive materials experience a change in the resistance of the material rather than a change in charge or voltage. Physical force exerted on the piezoelectric can be classiﬁed as one of two types: bending or compression. Stress of the compression type can be understood as a force exerted to one side of the piezoelectric while the opposing side rests against a ﬁxed surface, while bending involves a force being exerted on the piezoelectric from both sides.
Piezoelectric materials used for the purpose of accelerometers fall into two categories: single-crystal and ceramic materials. The ﬁrst and more widely used are single-crystal materials (usually quartz). Though these materials do oﬀer a long life span in terms of sensitivity, their disadvantage is that they are generally less sensitive than some piezoelectric ceramics. The other category, ceramic materials, have a higher piezoelectric constant (sensitivity) than single-crystal

materials and are less expensive to produce. Ceramics use barium titanate, lead zirconate–lead titanate, lead metaniobate, and other materials whose composition is considered proprietary by the company responsible for their development. The disadvantage of piezoelectric ceramics, however, is that their sensitivity degrades with time, making the longevity of the device less than that of single-crystal materials.
In applications when low-sensitivity piezoelectrics are used, two or more crystals can be connected together for output multiplication. The proper material can be chosen for particular applications based on the sensitivity, frequency response, bulk resistivity, and thermal response. Due to the low output signal and high output impedance that piezoelectric accelerometers possess, there is a need for ampliﬁcation and impedance conversion of the signal produced. In the past this problem was solved using a separate (external) ampliﬁer/impedance converter. This method, however, is generally impractical due to the noise that is introduced as well as the physical and environmental constraints posed on the system as a result. Today integrated circuit (IC) ampliﬁers/impedance converters are commercially available and are generally packaged within the case of the accelerometer itself as shown in Figure 3.11.
3.4.6 Piezoelectric Microphone
A microphone, colloquially mic or mike, is an acoustic-to-electric transducer or sensor that converts sound in air into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture production, live and recorded audio engineering, two-way radios, megaphones, radio and television broadcasting and, in computers, for recording voice, speech recognition, and VoIP and for non-acoustic purposes such as ultrasonic checking or knock sensors.
A crystal microphone or piezo microphone uses the phenomenon of piezoelectricity – the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure – to convert vibrations into an electrical signal (Figure 3.12). An example of this is potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. Their high output

impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10 mΩ) of the vacuum tube input stage well. The high impedance of the crystal microphone made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.
The types of piezoelectric transducers that are used nowadays are mostly synthetic rather than natural crystals. One such material is barium titanate, which is used in piezoelectric transducers for frequencies up to several hundred kilohertz. The original type of piezoelectric microphone that used a diaphragm coupled to the crystal is seldom seen nowadays. The sensitivity of modern piezoelectric materials to vibration is such that the impact of the sound wave on the crystal alone is enough to provide an adequate output. Most microphones of this type are made as pressure-operated types because one side of the crystal is normally used for securing the assembly to its casing.
The piezoelectric microphone has a very high impedance level and a much higher output than other types. The impedance level is of the order of several megaohms, as distinct from a few ohms for a moving coil type. At this very high impedance level, electrostatic pickup of hum is almost impossible to avoid, along with the problems of the loading and ﬁltering eﬀect of the microphone cable. For low-quality microphones, of the type that were once supplied with tape or cassette recorders, this is of little importance, but it rules out the use of a simple type of piezoelectric microphone for studio purposes. For such purposes, the crystal transducer can be coupled directly to a MOS preampliﬁer that can provide a low impedance output at the same high voltage level as is provided by the piezoelectric transducer. The preampliﬁer operating voltage can be supplied from a built-in battery to avoid the problem of running supply cables along with signal cables.
3.4.7 Piezoelectric Micropump
Research on micropump was initiated in 1980, and numerous diﬀerent pumps have since been developed. The ﬁrst micro diaphragm pump with piezoelectric actuation was designed by van Lintel et al. [33]. The piezoelectric pumps have attracted most attention, mainly because of the broad range of ﬂuids that can be pumped and because the pumps are readily realized using silicon micromechanics. In order to provide precise and repeatable pumped volumes of ﬂuids with

each cycle and to reduce the valve leakage problem, peristaltic micropump was designed [34]. In 1993, Stemme and Stemme ﬁrst proposed the valveless piezoelectric micropump [35].
The micropump basically includes two diﬀuser/nozzle elements, pump chamber, actuator unit, inlet and outlet channels, power supply module, and diaphragm/pump membrane as shown in Figure 3.13a,b. Actuator is necessary to operate the diaphragm of the micropump. The actuator is made up of a piezoelectric disk and a silicon membrane. The piezoelectric disk is made up of piezoelectric material such as PZT to yield mechanical strain by an external electric ﬁeld. The diﬀuser/nozzle determines the performance of the micropump. Diﬀuser with two ﬂat walls made up of silicon is selected for the proposed micropump design, which has a rectangular cross section with two parallel ﬂat walls and two convergent ﬂat walls as shown in Figure 3.14. The basic dimensions of the diﬀuser element involve the divergence angle 𝜃, the diﬀuser length L, and the width of the narrowest part W 1 [37].

One-inlet and one-outlet ﬂow hole is drilled in the inlet/outlet cavity of the micropump. Two short brass pipes are ﬁxed to the pump inlet and outlet holes for the tube attachment. A pump chamber having circular cavity made up of silicon and covered by glass substrate is considered. The diaphragm closes the cavity of the pump chamber, and it is bonded with the center disk of the actuator. In reciprocating pumping method, the ﬂow rate of the micropump depends on the stroke volume, which is the volume change in the chamber caused by diaphragm motion. A circular silicon diaphragm of 0.1 mm thickness and 6 mm in diameter is considered. An alternating voltage of 50 V (0 to peak) is applied across the piezoelectric disk. This voltage is required to be switched in the form of “on” and “oﬀ” such that required frequency of this voltage can be applied to the PZT stack to achieve pumping action. As a result, a control unit is interfaced between the power supply module and the micropump.
The pump operation is based on the ﬂuid ﬂow rectifying properties of the two nozzle/diﬀuser elements. The dimension diﬀerence at both ends of the diﬀuser causes the pressure diﬀerence and drives the ﬂuid. The pump cycle of the pump is divided into a “supply mode” and a “pump mode.” In the supply mode, the actuator increases the chamber volume, resulting in lower pressure inside the chamber. As a result, a larger amount of ﬂuid ﬂows into the chamber through the input element, which acts as a diﬀuser, rather than through the input element, which acts as a nozzle. In the pump mode, the actuator decreases the chamber volume, resulting in higher pressure inside the chamber. As a result, a larger amount of ﬂuid ﬂows out of the chamber through the output element, which acts as a diﬀuser, rather than through the output element, which acts as a nozzle [37].
Conventional drug delivery methods such as oral medications, inhalers, and subcutaneous injections do not deliver all drugs accurately and eﬃciently within their desired therapeutic range. Generally most of the drugs are eﬀective if delivered within a speciﬁc range of concentration between the desired maximum and minimum levels. Above the maximum range, they are toxic, and below the minimum range, they have no therapeutic beneﬁt. With controlled drug delivery systems consisting of drug reservoir, micropumps, valves, microsensors, microchannels, and necessary related circuits, appropriate and eﬀective amount of drug can be precisely calculated by the controller and released at appropriate time by the microactuator mechanism such as micropump [38]. Micropumps are therefore an essential component in the ﬂuid transport systems.

3.4.8 Piezoelectric Sound Diaphragm
The sound source of a piezoelectric sound component is the piezoelectric diaphragm. The piezoelectric diaphragm consists of a piezoelectric ceramic plate with electrodes on both sides, attached to a metal plate (brass, stainless steel, etc.) with conductive adhesive. Figure 3.15 shows the construction diagram of a piezoelectric diaphragm.
The sound is created from the movement of the metal plate. Applying a direct current (DC) voltage between electrodes of the piezoelectric diaphragm causes mechanical distortion due to the piezoelectric eﬀect. The distortion of the piezoelectric ceramic plate expands in the radial direction causing the metal plate to bend shown in Figure 3.16a. Reversing the polarity of the DC voltage causes the ceramic plate to shrink, bending the metal plate in the opposite direction, shown in Figure 3.16b. When an AC voltage is applied across the electrodes, the bending shown in Figure 3.16a,b is repeated as shown in Figure 3.16c, which produces sound waves in the air.
The piezoelectric element alone cannot produce a high sound pressure level (SPL). This is because the acoustical impedance of the element does not match that of any open air loading. Therefore a resonating cavity must be built to match the acoustical impedance of the element and the encased air. There are three methods of mounting the piezo diaphragm to a resonating cavity. The method

3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials 55

of mounting the diaphragm will aﬀect the sound output. The three methods of mounting are as follows:

1) Node support: The diaphragm is mounted at a node, a circumference where no vibration takes place. This method causes the least mechanical suppression of vibration and thus provides the highest SPL and the most stable oscillation frequency of the three methods. Node support enhances only a narrow range of frequencies but does so very well. The frequency of the sound output will equal the piezo diaphragm resonant frequency.
2) Edge support: The diaphragm is mounted at the outer edge of the disk, causing the entire disk to vibrate. This method suppresses the fundamental frequency by moving the node but provides a possibility of a wide frequency response. The frequency output will be approximately half of the piezo diaphragm resonant frequency.
3) Center support: The diaphragm is mounted at the center of the disk, causing the outer edge to vibrate. This method provides the lowest SPL since the main vibration area is forcefully supported. This method is not useful due to design diﬃculties.

In general, human’s audible frequency range is about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Frequency ranges of 2–4 kHz are most easily heard. For this reason, most piezoelectric sound components are used in this frequency range, and the resonant frequency (f 0) is generally selected in the same range too. As shown in Figure 3.17, the resonant frequency depends on methods used to support the piezoelectric diaphragm. If piezoelectric diaphragms are of the same shape, their values will become smaller in the order shown in Figure 3.17a–c. In general, the piezoelectric diaphragm is installed in a cavity to produce high sound pressure. The resonant frequency of the cavity is obtained from Helmholtz’s formula:

By designing the diaphragm and the cavity to have the same resonant frequency, the SPL is maximized and speciﬁc bandwidths can be provided.

3.4.9 Piezoelectric Solar Cell
Typical piezoelectric semiconductor crystals such as ZnO, GaN, InN, and CdS have noncentral symmetric wurtzite structure, and they are important optoelectronic materials for solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The individual inorganic solar cells are designed with a positive (p-junction) and a negative (n-junction) layer to create an electric ﬁeld. When n-type layer is doped, the element with an extra electron, generally phosphorus, is used to provide a negative charge to the layer. On the other hand, when p-type layer is doped, the element with fewer electrons, generally boron, is used to provide a positive charge to the layer. The place in between these two layers is called p–n cell junction.
Electrons in n-type layer are free and travel through the material to lower energy levels, while holes travel to higher energy levels when the photovoltaic (PV) cell is exposed to the sunlight. Free electrons jump across the p–n cell junction. These electrons then return to the n-type layer when the two sides of the cell are connected with a wire, and this electron ﬂow is known as the electric current. Figure 3.19 clearly presents the layers of an inorganic PV cell and the generation of electric current by ﬂowing electrons. Many researchers have concentrated on increasing the eﬃciency and achieving maximum power of PV cell. Recorded eﬃciency for a freestanding 50 μm thin-ﬁlm monocrystalline silicon solar cell is 17% [41] and for 47 μm thin-ﬁlm silicon cell is 21.5% [42], and the maximum recorded eﬃciency for inorganic solar cells is 24.7% [43].
Most recently, solar cells and photocells fabricated using piezoelectric semiconductors have demonstrated that the inner-crystal piezoelectric potential can be used eﬀectively for enhancing charge separation [44–46].
A piezopotential is formed in the crystal by the piezoelectric charges created by applying a stress. The inner-crystal piezopotential can eﬀectively tune/control the carrier separations and transport processes at the vicinity of a p–n junction or metal–semiconductor (M–S) contact, which is called the piezophototronic

eﬀect. The presence of piezoelectric charges at the interface/junction can significantly aﬀect the performances of photovoltaic devices, especially ﬂexible and printed organic/inorganic solar cells fabricated using piezoelectric semiconductor nano/microwires.
The basic structure of a typical nano/microwire solar cell is a p–n junction or M–S contact as shown in Figure 3.20a. The working principle of the solar cell is to use the high electric ﬁeld in the depletion region to assist the separation of electron–hole pairs generated by incident photons. The piezoelectric charges created at the junction area under strain can eﬀectively tune/control the solar cell performance. For example, ZnO nanowire solar cells are shown in Figure 3.20b,c, which are made up of a p-type nonpiezoelectric and an n-type piezoelectric heterojunction. The piezopotential signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the band structure at the interface, resulting in a control over the carrier generation, separation, and transport at the p–n junction or M–S interface, which is the fundamental piezophototronic eﬀect. The piezophototronic eﬀect created by external stress assists the design for higher-performance solar cell [47].
3.4.10 Piezoelectric Generator
Piezoelectric generators are made up of piezoelectric materials; these materials have a natural ability to create electrical potential when compressed, expanded, or changed in shape (mechanical change). In other words, piezoelectric eﬀect is nothing but the ability of certain materials to convert the mechanical change into electric charge. This eﬀect works conversely as well. Charge ﬂow through the material will also result in change of shape. One of the major uses of piezoelectric generators is for energy collection. These generators can collect enough energy to power personal gadgets and phones.
A majority of piezoelectric generators that have been fabricated and tested use some variation of PZT. Typically, PZT is used for piezoelectric energy harvesters because of its large piezoelectric coeﬃcient and dielectric constant, allowing it

to produce more power for a given input acceleration [48]. Another less common material is aluminum nitride (AlN). Though it has a smaller piezoelectric coeﬃcient and dielectric constant, aluminum nitride has advantages in material deposition and in compatibility with the standard CMOS processes used for fabrication of IC [49].
Piezoelectric materials have a built-in polarization and therefore respond differently to stresses depending on the direction. There are two primary modes of electromechanical coupling for piezoelectric materials: the 3–1 mode (d31) and the 3–3 mode (d33). In the 3–1 mode, the material has an induced electric ﬁeld in direction 3, as a response to the stress along direction 1, but in the 3–3 mode, the material is subjected to a stress in the same direction of the produced electric ﬁeld.
The vast majority of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices use a cantilever beam structure. A cantilever beam, by deﬁnition, is a beam with a support only at one end and is often referred to as a ﬁxed-free beam. When the generator is subjected to vibrations in the vertical direction, the support structure will move up and down in sync with the external acceleration. The vibration of the beam is induced by its own inertia; since the beam is not perfectly rigid, it tends to deﬂect when the base support moves up and down (Figure 3.21). Typically, a proof mass is added to the free end of the beam to increase that deﬂection amount. This lowers the resonant frequency of the beam and increases the deﬂection of the beam as it vibrates. The larger deﬂection leads to more stress, more strain,

and, consequently, higher output voltage and power [50]. Electrodes covering a portion of the cantilever beam are used to conduct the electric charges produced in an electrical circuit where they can be utilized to charge a capacitor or drive a load. Diﬀerent electrode lengths or shapes have been shown to aﬀect the output voltage, since strain is not uniform across the beam [51].
The vibration energy-harvesting principle using piezoelectric materials [52] is illustrated in Figure 3.22. The conversion chain starts with a mechanical energy source: bike. Bike vibrations are converted into electricity via piezoelectric element. The electricity produced is thereafter formatted by a static converter before supplying a storage system or the load (electrical device). The piezoelectric generator can produce few milliwatt energy and is able to power LED lamp. Under ideal conditions such as pure sinusoidal vibrations at 5 ms−2 and 12.5 Hz, the power harvestable measured achieved 3.5 mW for an optimal resistive load of 100 kΩ, the power that is suﬃcient to recharge a battery or to power low-consumption devices.
3.4.11 Piezoelectric Nanogenerator
The piezoelectric nanogenerator is an energy-harvesting device converting the external kinetic energy into an electrical energy based on the energy conversion by nanostructured piezoelectric material. Although its deﬁnition may include any types of energy-harvesting devices with nanostructure converting the various types of the ambient energy (e.g., solar power and thermal energy), it is used most of the times to speciﬁcally indicate the kinetic energy-harvesting devices utilizing nanoscaled piezoelectric material after its ﬁrst introduction in 2006 [14].
An atomic force microscope (AFM) tip is swept through the tip of the nanowire as shown in Figure 3.23a. Only negatively charged portion will allow the current to ﬂow through the interface. But, as shown in Figure 3.23b, the nanowire is integrated with the counter electrode with AFM tip-like grating. As shown in

Figure 3.23a, the electrons are transported from the compressed portion of the nanowire to the counter electrode because of Schottky contact.
The working principle of a nanogenerator can be explained for two diﬀerent cases: the force exerted perpendicular (Figure 3.23) and parallel to the axis of the nanowire (Figure 3.24).
The working principle for the ﬁrst case is explained by a vertically grown nanowire subjected to the laterally moving tip as shown in Figure 3.23b. When a piezoelectric structure is subjected to the external force by the moving tip, the deformation occurs throughout the structure. The piezoelectric eﬀect will create

3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials 61
the electrical ﬁeld inside the nanostructure; the stretched part with the positive strain will exhibit the positive electrical potential, whereas the compressed part with the negative strain will show the negative electrical potential. This is due to the relative displacement of cations with respect to anions in its crystalline structure. As a result, the tip of the nanowire will have an electrical potential distribution on its surface, while the bottom of the nanowire is neutralized since it is grounded.
The electrical contact plays an important role to pump out charges on the surface of the tip. The Schottky contact must be formed between the counter electrode and the tip of the nanowire since the ohmic contact will neutralize the electrical ﬁeld generated at the tip. In order to form an eﬀective Schottky contact, the electron aﬃnity (Ea) must be smaller than the work function (𝜑) of the metal composing the counter electrode. For the case of ZnO nanowire with an electron aﬃnity of 4.5 eV, Pt (𝜑 = 6.1 eV) is a suitable metal to construct the Schottky contact. By constructing the Schottky contact, the electrons will pass to the counter electrode from the surface of the tip when the counter electrode is in contact with the regions of the negative potential, whereas no current will be generated when it is in contact with the regions of the positive potential, in the case of n-type semiconductive nanostructure (p-type semiconductive structure will exhibit the reversed phenomenon since the hole is mobile in this case). The formation of the Schottky contact also contributes to the generation of DC output signal consequently.
For the second case, a model with a vertically grown nanowire stacked between the ohmic contact at its bottom and the Schottky contact at its top is considered as shown in Figure 3.24. When the force is applied toward the tip of the nanowire, the uniaxial compressive is generated in the nanowire. Due to the piezoelectric eﬀect, the tip of the nanowire will have a negative piezoelectric potential, increasing the Fermi level at the tip. Since the electrons will then ﬂow from the tip to the bottom through the external circuit as a result, the positive electrical potential will be generated at the tip. The Schottky contact will barricade the electrons being transported through the interface, therefore maintaining the potential at the tip. As the force is removed, the piezoelectric eﬀect diminishes, and the electrons will be ﬂowing back to the top in order to neutralize the positive potential at the tip. The second case will generate alternating current (AC) output signal.
3.4.11.1 Types of Piezoelectric Nanogenerator Depending on the conﬁguration of the piezoelectric nanostructure, most of the nanogenerators can be categorized into three types: vertical nanowire integrated nanogenerator (VING), lateral nanowire integrated nanogenerator (LING), and nanocomposite electrical generator (NEG).
3.4.11.1.1 Vertical Nanowire Integrated Nanogenerator (VING) The VING is a three-dimensional conﬁguration consisting of a stack of three layers in general, which are the base electrode, the vertically grown piezoelectric nanostructure, and the counter electrode (Figure 3.25a,b). The piezoelectric nanostructure is usually grown from the base electrode by various synthesizing

techniques that are then integrated with the counter electrode in full or partial mechanical contact with its tip.
Wang et al. have introduced a basic conﬁguration of VING where they used a tip of AFM to induce the deformation of a single vertical ZnO nanowire [55]. The ﬁrst VING utilizes the counter electrode with the periodic surface grating resembling the arrays of AFM tip as a moving electrode. Since the counter electrode is not in full contact with the tips of the piezoelectric nanowire, its motion in plane or out of plane occurred by the external vibration induces the deformation of the piezoelectric nanostructure, leading to the generation of the electrical potential distribution inside each individual nanowire. It should be noted that the counter electrode is coated with the metal forming the Schottky contact with the tip of the nanowire where only the compressed portion of the piezoelectric nanowire would allow the accumulated electrons pass through the barrier between its tip and the counter electrode, in case of n-type nanowire. The switch-on and switch-oﬀ characteristic of this conﬁguration shows its capability of generating DC generation without any requirement for the external rectiﬁer.
In VING with partial contact, the geometry of the counter electrode plays an important role. The ﬂat counter electrode would not induce a suﬃcient deformation of the piezoelectric nanostructures, especially when the counter electrode moves by in-plane mode. After the basic geometry resembling the array of AFM tips, a few other approaches have been followed for facile development of the counter electrode. Professor Zhong Lin Wang’s group has generated a counter electrode composed of ZnO nanorods utilizing a similar technique used for synthesizing ZnO nanowire array. Wang et al. have generated a counter electrode composed of ZnO nanorods utilizing a similar technique used for synthesizing ZnO nanowire array. Kim et al. and Choi et al. have introduced bowl-shaped transparent counter electrode by combining anodized

aluminum and the electroplating technology [56]. They also have developed the other type of the counter electrode by using networked single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) on the ﬂexible substrate, which is not only eﬀective for energy conversion but also transparent [57].
The other type of VING has been also suggested. While it shares the identical geometric conﬁguration with the aforementioned, such a VING has full mechanical contact between the tips of the nanowires and the counter electrode [58]. This conﬁguration is eﬀective for application where the force is exerted in the vertical direction (toward the c axis of the piezoelectric nanowire), and it generates AC unlike VINGs with partial contact.

3.4.11.1.2 Lateral Nanowire Integrated Nanogenerator (LING) The LING is a two-dimensional conﬁguration consisting of three parts: the base electrode, the laterally grown piezoelectric nanostructure, and the metal electrode for Schottky contact (Figure 3.26). In most cases, the thickness of the substrate ﬁlm is much thicker than the diameter of the piezoelectric nanostructure, so the individual nanostructure is subjected to the pure tensile strain.
The LING is an expansion of single-wire generator (SWG) where a laterally aligned nanowire is integrated on the ﬂexible substrate. SWG is rather a scientiﬁc conﬁguration used for verifying the capability of electrical energy generation of a piezoelectric material and is widely adopted in the early stage of the development.
As of VINGs with full mechanical contact, LING generates AC electrical signal. The output voltage can be ampliﬁed by constructing an array of LING connected in series on the single substrate, leading to the constructive addition of the output voltage. Such a conﬁguration may lead to the practical application of LING for scavenging large-scale power, for example, wind or ocean waves.

3.4.11.1.3 Nanocomposite Electrical Generators (NEGs) The “NEG” is a three-dimensional conﬁguration consisting of three main parts: the metal plate electrodes, the vertically grown piezoelectric nanostructure, and

the polymer matrix, which ﬁlls in between in the piezoelectric nanostructure (Figure 3.27).
The NEG was introduced by Momeni et al. [59]. It was shown that NEG has a higher eﬃciency compared with the original nanogenerator conﬁguration in which a ZnO nanowire will be bended by an AFM tip. It is also shown that it provides an energy source with higher sustainability.
3.4.11.1.4 Other Type of Nanogenerator In 2008, Wang suggested a fabric-like geometrical conﬁguration of a nanogenerator [60]. The piezoelectric nanowire is grown vertically on the two microﬁbers in its radial direction, and they are twined to form a nanogenerator. One of the microﬁbers is coated with the metal to form a Schottky contact, serving as the counter electrode of VINGs. As the movable microﬁber is stretched, the deformation of the nanostructure occurs on the stationary microﬁber, resulting in the voltage generation. Its working principle is identical to that of VINGs with partial mechanical contact, thus generating a DC electrical signal.
3.4.11.2 Materials Among various piezoelectric materials studied for the nanogenerator, many of the researches have been focused on the materials with wurtzite structure such as ZnO, CdS [16], and GaN [61]. The greatest advantage of these materials arises from the facile and cost-eﬀective fabrication technique, hydrothermal synthesis. Since the hydrothermal synthesis can be conducted in a low-temperature environment under 100 ∘C in addition to vertical and crystalline growth, these materials can be integrated in various substrates with reduced concern for their physical characteristics such as melting temperature.
Endeavors for enhancing the piezoelectricity of the individual nanowire also led to the development of other piezoelectric materials based on wurtzite structure. Wang introduced p-type ZnO nanowire [19]. Unlike the n-type semiconductive nanostructure, the mobile particle in p-type is a hole; thus, the Schottky behavior is reversed from that of n-type case; the electrical signal is generated from the portion of the nanostructure where the holes are accumulated. It is experimentally proven that p-type ZnO nanowire can generate the output signal nearly 10 times that of n-type ZnO nanowire.

3.4 Applications of Piezoelectric Materials 65
From the idea that a material with a perovskite structure is known to have more eﬀective piezoelectric characteristic compared with that with a wurtzite structure, barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanowire has been also studied by Yu [17]. The output signal is found to be more than 16 times that from a similar ZnO nanowire. Professor Liwei Lin of University of California at Berkeley has suggested that PVDF can be also applied to form a nanogenerator [62]. Being a polymer, PVDF utilizes a near-ﬁeld electrospinning for its fabrication, which is rather a diﬀerent technique compared to other materials. The nanoﬁber can be directly written on the substrate controlling the process, and this technique is expected to be applied for forming self-powered textile based on nanoﬁber.
3.4.11.3 Applications Nanogenerators are expected to be used for various applications where the periodic kinetic energy exists, such as wind and ocean waves on a large scale to the muscle movement by the beat of the heart or inhalation of the lungs on a small scale. The further feasible applications are as follows:
1) Self-powered nano/micro devices: One of the feasible applications of nanogenerator is an independent or a supplementary energy source to nano/micro devices consuming relatively low amount of energy under a condition where the kinetic energy is supplied continuously. One example was introduced by Wang’s group in 2010 with a self-powered pH or UV sensor integrated VING with an output voltage of 20–40 mV onto the sensor. Still, the converted electrical energy is relatively small for operating nano/micro devices; therefore the range of their application is still bounded as a supplementary energy source to the battery. The breakthrough is being sought by combining the nanogenerators with other types of energy-harvesting devices, such as solar cell or biochemical energy harvester [63, 64]. This approach is expected to contribute to the development of the energy source suitable for the application where the independent operation is crucial, such as smartdust.
2) Smart wearable systems: The outﬁt integrated or made up of the textiles with the piezoelectric ﬁber is one of the feasible applications of the nanogenerator. The kinetic energy from the human body is converted to the electrical energy through the piezoelectric ﬁbers, which can be possibly applied to supply the portable electronic devices such as health monitoring system attached with the smart wearable systems. The nanogenerator such as VING can be also easily integrated in the shoes employing the walking motion of the human body. Another similar application is a power-generating artiﬁcial skin. Wang’s group has shown the possibility of generating AC voltage of up to 100 mV from the ﬂexible SWG attached to the running hamster [65].
3) Transparent and ﬂexible devices: Some of the piezoelectric nanostructures can be formed in various kinds of substrates, such as ﬂexible and transparent organic substrates. The research groups in SKKU (S. W. Kim’s group) and SAIT (J. Y. Choi’s group) have developed a transparent and ﬂexible nanogenerator, which can be possibly used for self-powered tactile sensor and anticipated that the development may be extended to the energy-eﬃcient touch screen

devices. Their research focus is being extended to enhance the transparency of the device and the cost-eﬀectiveness by substituting indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode with a graphene layer [66]. 4) Implantable telemetric energy receiver: The nanogenerator based on ZnO nanowire can be applied for implantable devices since ZnO not only is biocompatible but also can be synthesized from the organic substrate, rendering the nanogenerator biocompatible. The implantable device integrated with the nanogenerator can be operated by receiving the external ultrasonic vibration outside the human body, which is converted to electrical energy by the piezoelectric nanostructure.

3.4.12 Piezoelectric Motors
The piezoelectric motors are electromechanical drive systems in which the limited displacement of a piezoceramic element is converted into an unlimited rotary or translator motion of a rotor or slider. The displacement of the piezoceramic in the desired direction of motion is transferred to the rotor or slider over an intermittent fractional coupling.
In 1942, Williams and Brown of Brush Development Company reported having built a piezoelectric motor [67] as shown in Figure 3.28a. Their invention comprised a process for converting a multiphase electrical signal into mechanical motion using the inverse piezoelectric phenomenon. Figure 3.28b shows the structure of the motor’s stator in which four piezoelectric rectangular elements were bonded to all faces of a quadratic bar forming a composite structure. The motion was generated at one end of the bar upon exciting the piezoelectric elements with two-phase potential. The motor’s operating principle is identical to that of a traveling-wave motor if the phase diﬀerence is set to 90∘. Since then, there have been numerous developments in the ﬁeld of piezoelectric motors [68–72].
In 1965, Lavrinenko and Nekrasov introduced the ﬁrst piezoelectric ultrasonic motor [73]. It consists of an ultrasonic piezoelectric plate pressed against a smooth rotor. This invention marked the beginning of systematic investigation and basic research in the area of ultrasonic piezo motors.
In 2006, Spanner et al. designed a linear ultrasonic piezo motor as shown in Figure 3.29 [74]. These piezo motors are of very simple design, consisting of two

basic parts: the actuator (stator) and the sled (spring bonded to two sliders), the moving part of the motor. The actuator consists of a rectangular piezoceramic plate of size L × W × 0.5L polarized in the thickness direction. The two large faces of the plate are covered by electrodes. On one top as shown in Figure 3.29 are the two exciter electrodes, each covering half of the surface. The bottom surface has a single electrode that serves as a common drain. The actuator plate has guide grooves cut in the long edges. The sled has sliders that are pressed against the ceramic actuator by the integrated spring. The entire motor consists of the piezoceramic plate and the moving sled, guided along the integrated grooves in the plate.
Figure 3.30a–c show the E(3,1) oscillation mode of a piezoelectric plate. The areas with the highest oscillation amplitudes in the height direction are on the long edges of the plane, at the exact center as shown in Figure 3.30c. The maxima for longitudinal oscillation are somewhat oﬀset relative to the height maxima. The deformation of the plate is thus symmetrical relative to the length and width symmetry planes of the plate. The operation principle of the ultrasonic motor is based upon asymmetric resonant excitation in the piezoelectric plate in an E(3,1) mode. The asymmetric E(3,1) excitation is accomplished using the split electrode. In so doing, the actuator is excited with a sine wave voltage applied to one of the excitation electrodes, while the other ﬂoats. Under the inﬂuence of such an asymmetric E(3,1) oscillation, the points of the guide grooves move along straight-line paths inclined at diﬀerent angles relative to the surface. The motion amplitudes of the individual points diﬀer as a function of position. There are even some locations where the motion is in the opposite direction. The sliders, which are pressed into the guide grooves, receive tiny pushing impulses of varying amplitude from

all the points they contact. The resultant force developed is one that moves the slider in the desired direction.
In 2007, Henderson and Viggiano have designed the world’s smallest linear motor, at only 1.55 mm × 1.55 mm square and 6 mm long [75, 76], as shown in Figure 3.31a. The actuator uses less than 0.1 W to produce 20 g of force at 5 mm s−1. Its high linear force, power, precision, and low cost make the motor ideal for numerous micro motion applications including mobile phone cameras, microﬂuidic devices, implantable drug pumps, and deformable mirrors for adaptive optics.
The piezoelectric linear SQUIGGLE motor uses ultrasonic standing-wave vibrations in a threaded nut to directly rotate a screw as shown in Figure 3.31b. This unique operating principle “wraps” the vibration motion of the nut around the screw threads to directly produce linear movement without requiring additional mechanical conversion. The thread friction is not parasitic but is used to directly rotate the screw. The threads multiply the linear force and position resolution and reduce the linear speed. The result is a tiny high-force motor capable of sub-micrometer stepping and velocity control without the need for a position sensor and high-speed servo control loop. Additional features include precise oﬀ-power hold and a manual adjustment option by turning the screw. The nut vibration is sometimes described as a “hula hoop” or wobbling motion. A small axial preload maintains constant contact between the nut and screw threads, which causes the tangential friction force to rotate and translate the screw. Two orthogonal bending vibrations are combined to create the orbital motion. The two bending modes are created using orthogonal piezoelectric plates bonded to the outside of the metal nut.
In the SQUIGGLE motor, four PZT plates are bonded to ﬂat surfaces on the outside of the metal tube at 90∘ spacing. The poling directions are aligned such that a common drive voltage on opposite pairs of plates produces opposing strain. The opposing d31 strain is parallel to the plate surface and bends the nut. The bending strain is applied at a frequency matched to the ﬁrst bending resonant frequency of the tube (Figure 3.32). At this mechanical resonant frequency, a small PZT strain is ampliﬁed by the Q of the mechanical system. By symmetry, the resonant frequency of the orthogonal PZT plate pairs is matched. The hula hoop vibration mode is created by generating PZT strain in orthogonal plate pairs at

the resonant frequency with 90∘ phase shift. The PZT plates are activated using a two-phase electrical drive with a ﬁxed frequency and ±90∘ phase shift. Drive frequency and amplitude depend on the motor model and vary from 40 to 200 kHz and 20 to 200 V, respectively. Positive phase shift produces forward movement, while negative phase shift produces backward movement.
3.4.13 Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM)
The dominance of the quartz crystal for all kind of frequency control applications started in 1934 when the AT-cut quartz crystal was introduced. This method relies on the piezoelectric properties of quartz, in particular a single quartz crystal that is cut into a thin wafer at an angle of approximately 35∘ with respect to the polar z-axis of quartz. The advantage with the AT-cut quartz crystal is that it has nearly zero frequency drift with temperature around room temperature. From the very beginning of using quartz crystal resonators as frequency control elements, it was common to increase the frequency of the resonator by drawing pencil marks on the electrodes or decreasing the frequency by rubbing oﬀ some electrode material with an eraser. The understanding of this mass-induced frequency shift was only known on a qualitative basis. However, in 1959, Sauerbrey published a paper that showed that the frequency shift of a quartz crystal resonator is directly proportional to the added mass [77]. Sauerbrey’s work is generally taken as the breakthrough and the ﬁrst step toward a new quantitative tool to measure very small masses, that is, the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM).
Hence, one can describe the QCM to be an ultrasensitive mass sensor. The heart of the QCM is the piezoelectric AT-cut quartz crystal sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. When the electrodes are connected to an oscillator and an AC voltage is applied over the electrodes, the quartz crystal starts to oscillate at its resonance frequency due to the piezoelectric eﬀect (Figure 3.33). This oscillation is generally very stable due to the high quality of the oscillation (high Q factor).
If a rigid layer is evenly deposited on one or both of the electrodes, the resonant frequency will decrease proportionally to the mass of the adsorbed layer according to the Sauerbrey equation:
Δf = − 2√f02Δm A rqmq

The Sauerbrey equation is only strictly applicable to uniform, rigid thin-ﬁlm deposits. Due to this, the QCM was for many years just regarded as a gas-phase mass detector. Not until the beginning of the 1980s, scientists realized that a quartz crystal can be excited to a stable oscillation when it was completely immersed in a liquid. After it was found out that an excessive viscous loading would not prohibit the use of QCM in liquids and that the response of the QCM is still extremely sensitive to mass changes at the solid–liquid interface, QCMs have been used in direct contact with liquids and/or viscoelastic ﬁlms to assess the changes in mass and viscoelastic properties. Even in air or vacuum, where the damping of layers has been considered to be negligible or small, the QCM has been used to probe dissipative processes on the quartz crystal. This is especially true for soft condensed matters such as thick polymer layers deposited on the quartz surface.

3.4.13.1 Applications of QCM The QCM is basically a mass sensing device with the ability to measure very small mass changes on a quartz crystal resonator in real time. The sensitivity of the QCM is approximately 100 times higher than an electronic ﬁne balance with a sensitivity of 0.1 mg. This means that QCMs are capable of measuring mass changes as small as a fraction of a monolayer or single layer of atoms. The high sensitivity and the real-time monitoring of mass changes on the sensor crystal make QCM a very attractive technique for a large range of applications. Especially, the development of QCM systems for use in ﬂuids or with viscoelastic deposits has dramatically increased the interest toward this technique. Major advantages of the QCM technique used for liquid systems are that it allows a label-free detection of molecules. A partial list of the application areas of the QCM is given as follows:

• Thin-ﬁlm thickness monitoring in thermal, e-beam, sputtering, magnetron, ion, and laser deposition
• Electrochemistry of interfacial processes at electrode surfaces

3.4.14 The Quartz Crystal Oscillator
The most important feature of any oscillator is its frequency stability or in other words its ability to provide a constant frequency output under varying load conditions. To obtain a very high level of oscillator stability, a quartz crystal is generally used as the frequency-determining device to produce various types of oscillator circuits known generally as a quartz crystal oscillators.
When a voltage source is applied to a small thin piece of quartz crystal, it begins to change shape, producing a characteristic known as the piezoelectric eﬀect. This piezoelectric eﬀect is the property of a crystal by which an electrical charge produces a mechanical force by changing the shape of the crystal. This piezoelectric eﬀect produces mechanical vibrations or oscillations that are used to replace the Inductor and capacitor (LC) tank circuit in the oscillators.
The quartz crystal used in a quartz crystal oscillator is a very small thin piece or wafer of cut quartz with the two parallel surfaces metalized to make the required electrical connections. The physical size and thickness of a piece of quartz crystal

is tightly controlled since it aﬀects the ﬁnal or fundamental frequency of oscillations. The fundamental frequency is called the crystal’s characteristic frequency.
The crystal’s characteristic or resonant frequency is inversely proportional to its physical thickness between the two metalized surfaces. A mechanically vibrating crystal can be represented by an equivalent electrical circuit consisting of low resistance, large inductance, and small capacitance as shown in Figure 3.34.
The equivalent circuit for the quartz crystal shows an Resistor, inductor and capacitor (RLC) series circuit, which represents the mechanical vibrations of the crystal, in parallel with a capacitance, Cp, which represents the electrical connections to the crystal. Quartz crystal oscillators operate at “parallel resonance,” and the equivalent impedance of the crystal has a series resonance where Cs resonates with inductance, L, and a parallel resonance where L resonates with the series combination of Cs and Cp as shown in Figure 3.34.
Quartz crystal oscillators were developed for high-stability frequency references during the 1920s and 1930s. Prior to crystals, radio stations controlled their frequency with tuned circuits, which could easily drift oﬀ frequency by 3–4 kHz [80]. Since stations were assigned frequencies only 10 kHz apart, interference between adjacent stations due to frequency drift was common [80]. In 1925 Westinghouse tried out a crystal oscillator in its ﬂagship station KDKA [80], and by 1926, quartz crystals were used to control the frequency of many broadcasting stations and were popular with amateur radio operators [81]. In 1928, Marrison (of Bell Telephone Laboratories) developed the ﬁrst quartz crystal clock. This invention replaced the escapement and pendulum (as the timing reference), relying instead on the natural vibrations occurring in the quartz crystal

as the oscillator. With accuracies of up to 1 s in 30 years (or 30 ms per year) [82], quartz clocks became the world’s most accurate timekeepers until atomic clocks were developed in the 1950s. Utilizing the early work at Bell Labs, AT&T eventually established their Frequency Control Products Division, later spun oﬀ and known today as Vectron International [83].

Ferroelectricity
4.1 Introduction
Ferroelectricity is a property of certain materials that have a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric ﬁeld. The term is used in analogy to ferromagnetism, in which a material exhibits a permanent magnetic moment. Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in Rochelle salt by Valasek. Thus, the preﬁx ferro, meaning iron, was used to describe the property despite the fact that most ferroelectric (FE) materials do not contain iron.
FE materials – for example, barium titanate (BaTiO3) and Rochelle salt – are composed of crystals in which the structural units are tiny electric dipoles; that is, in each unit the centers of positive charge and of negative charge are slightly separated. In some crystals these electric dipoles spontaneously line up in clusters called domains, and in FE crystals the domains can be oriented predominantly in one direction by a strong external electric ﬁeld. Reversing the external ﬁeld reverses the predominant orientation of the FE domains, though the switching to a new direction lags somewhat behind the change in the external electric ﬁeld. This lag of electric polarization behind the applied electric ﬁeld is FE hysteresis, named by analogy with ferromagnetic (FM) hysteresis. Ferroelectricity ceases in a given material above a characteristic temperature, called its Curie temperature, because the heat agitates the dipoles suﬃciently to overcome the forces that spontaneously align them.
FE materials exhibit a wide spectrum of functional properties, including switchable polarization, piezoelectricity, high nonlinear optical activity, pyroelectricity, and nonlinear dielectric behavior. These properties are crucial for application in electronic devices such as high-dielectric-constant capacitors, pyroelectric devices, transducers for medical diagnostic, piezoelectric sound navigation and ranging (sonars), electro-optic light valves, electromechanical transducers, sensors, microactuators, infrared (IR) detectors, microwave phase ﬁlters, and nonvolatile memories. This unique combination of properties of FE materials has attracted researchers and engineers for a long time. Over the past few years, the ferroelectricity at nanoscale received a great attention from the scientists on the development of new technologies. The demand for FE systems with speciﬁc applications enforced the in-depth research in addition to the

improvement of processing and characterization techniques. In this chapter, an eﬀort is made to introduce the basic principles governing ferroelectricity, and a list of various FE materials and applications of FE materials is brieﬂy discussed.

4.2 Ferroelectrics

Ferroelectrics are the most typical nonlinear dielectrics. Apart from the dependence of permittivity on electric ﬁeld intensity, the most essential features of this class of dielectrics are hysteresis under the action of an alternative voltage. It is possible to obtain for an FE a loop of electric hysteresis: displacement–electric ﬁeld intensity D–E. This loop is similar to a loop of magnetic hysteresis: magnetic induction–magnetic ﬁeld intensity B–H for FM materials. The presence of spontaneous polarization without an external electric ﬁeld usually acts on the FE materials. FE crystals possess regions with uniform polarization called FE domains. Within a domain, all the electric dipoles are aligned in the same direction. There may be many domains in a crystal separated by interfaces called domain walls. An FE single crystal, when grown, has multiple FE domains. A single domain can be obtained by domain wall motion made possible by the application of an appropriate electric ﬁeld. A very strong ﬁeld could lead to the reversal of the polarization in the domain, known as domain switching. The main diﬀerence between pyroelectric and FE materials is that the direction of the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectrics can be switched by an applied electric ﬁeld. The polarization reversal can be observed by measuring the FE hysteresis as shown in Figure 4.1. As the electric ﬁeld strength is increased, the domains start to align in the positive direction, giving rise to a rapid increase in the polarization (OB). At very high ﬁeld levels, the polarization reaches a saturation value. The polarization does not fall to zero when the external ﬁeld is removed. At zero external ﬁeld, some of the domains remain aligned in the positive direction; hence the crystal will show a remnant polarization Pr (OD). The crystal cannot be completely depolarized until a ﬁeld of magnitude Ec is applied in the negative direction. The external ﬁeld needed to reduce the polarization to zero is called the coercive ﬁeld strength Ec. If the ﬁeld is increased to a more negative value, the direction of polarization ﬂips, and hence a hysteresis loop is obtained. The value of the spontaneous polarization Ps (OE) is obtained by extrapolating the curve onto the polarization axes (BE).

4.2.1 History of Ferroelectricity
Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in single-crystal materials (Rochelle salt) in 1921 and its subsequent extension into the realm of polycrystalline ceramics (barium titanate, BaTiO3) during the early to mid-1940s, there has been a continuous succession of new materials and technology developments that have led to a signiﬁcant number of industrial and commercial applications that can be directly credited to this most unusual phenomenon. Among these applications are high-dielectric-constant capacitors, piezoelectric sonar and ultrasonic transducers, radio and communication ﬁlters, pyroelectric security surveillance devices, medical diagnostic transducers, stereo tweeters, buzzers, gas ignitors, positive temperature coeﬃcient (PTC) sensors and switches, ultrasonic motors, electro-optic light valves, thin-ﬁlm capacitors, and FE thin-ﬁlm memories.
The history of the discovery of ferroelectricity is a fascinating one that extends as far back as the mid-1600s when Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate) was ﬁrst prepared by Elie Seignette in La Rochelle, France, for medicinal purposes. However, it was approximately 200 years later before this water-soluble crystalline material would be investigated for its pyroelectric (thermal–polar) properties, another half century before its piezoelectric (stress–polar) properties would be uncovered, and ﬁnally, another 40 years would pass before ferroelectricity would be ﬁrst discovered by Joseph Valasek in this same material [1–4]. Rochelle salt was a popular material in these initial studies because it was readily available and easily grown as large single crystals of excellent optical quality, but its water solubility eventually led to its disuse in later years. Several excellent papers on the history of ferroelectricity have been written, and the reader is referred to these for many of the details [5–11].
There have been many excellent individuals and institutions that have been involved in the research, development, and application of these very interesting materials. A chronological listing of many of the more notable speciﬁc events in the history of FE materials is given in Table 4.1.
The time period is from the early 1800s to the present, involving events from the early work on single-crystal Rochelle salt to the birth of FE ceramics in the 1940s, the development of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramics in the mid-1950s, the lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics in the late

1960s, the engineered FE composites of the late 1970s, the development of lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor ceramics and the use of sol–gel techniques for the preparation of FE ﬁlms in the 1980s, the strain-ampliﬁed actuators of the early 1990s, and the current integrated FE ﬁlms on silicon.
FE materials remain subjects of intensive investigation today for three principal reasons. First, the unique dielectric, pyroelectric, piezoelectric, and electro-optic properties exhibited by FE crystals, ceramics, composites, and thin ﬁlms can be exploited in great many devices of commercial importance. Second, apart from their many technological applications, FE materials as a class exhibit a great diversity of phase transitions that make them ideal objects for scientiﬁc investigations into the origins and mechanisms of a wide range of structural transformation phenomena. Finally, advances in thin-ﬁlm deposition and nanoscale fabrication techniques made over the past two decades have created new possibilities for the integration of these materials into the ever-expanding array of microelectronic devices.
The synthesis of FE nanosized materials such as rods, wires, and hollow tubes has created a strong research interest over the past few years for a variety of applications. Various chemical processing routes show promise for the fabrication of nanosized materials [57, 58, 60–64, 67, 68]. The nanoscaling can be used to form high-density arrays of monodomain FE nanostructures, which are desirable for the miniaturization of energy-harvesting devices [69, 70, 86–89, 92]. Energy-harvesting technologies involve converting the various existing power sources, such as thermal energy, mechanical energy, and vibrational energy from the environment to power the portable, wearable, or wireless electronic devices and thus replace the batteries. Recently, a variety of FE materials and nanostructures were employed for nanogenerators (NGs) and nanocapacitors, such as BaTiO3 nanowires [71–77], PZT nanoﬁbers [78–85], lead magnesium niobate–lead titanate (PMN-PT) nanowires [93], KNbO3 nanorods [91], NaNbO3 nanowires [90], and LiNbO3 nanowires [94].
4.2.2 Ferroelectric Phase Transitions
A phase transition is the transformation of thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another. It is a collective phenomenon in which the critical behavior depends on small number of parameters and is universal for many systems. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change, often discontinuously, as a result of some external condition, such as temperature, pressure, and others. Phase transition involves some change of symmetry. According to Paul Ehrenfest, phase transitions can be divided into two major groups called ﬁrst- and second-order transitions, depending on whether the transition is discontinuous or continuous, respectively. Paul Ehrenfest classiﬁed phase transitions based on the behavior of the thermodynamic free energy as a function of other thermodynamic variables. Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. First-order phase transitions exhibit a discontinuity in the ﬁrst derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable [95]. Second-order phase transitions are continuous in the

84 4 Ferroelectricity

ﬁrst derivative but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy [95]. Though useful, Ehrenfest’s classiﬁcation has been found to be an inaccurate method of classifying phase transitions, for it does not take into account the case where a derivative of free energy diverges (which is only possible in the thermodynamic limit). For instance, in the FM transition, the heat capacity diverges to inﬁnity.
In the modern classiﬁcation scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes. First-order phase transitions are those that involve a latent heat. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a ﬁxed (and typically large) amount of energy. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a “mixed-phase regime” in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not. Familiar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into vapor but forms a turbulent mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Second-order phase transitions are also called continuous phase transitions. They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an inﬁnite correlation length, and a power law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the FM transition, superconducting transition, and superﬂuid transition.
In ferroelectrics two common types of phase transition are identiﬁed. These are named depending on how the order parameter (polarization) changes during the transition. It is common to observe that as the temperature is raised, the bulk polarization decreases and vanishes abruptly at a temperature Tc. This is a phase transition, just as in a ferromagnet raised above its Curie temperature or a solid raised above its melting point.
It arises microscopically because as temperature is raised the thermal vibrations of the atoms in the solid cause ﬂuctuations, which overcome the potential barrier between the two (or more) wells. It is most easily understood in a molecular crystal such as NaNO2, where one can imagine that each molecule can ﬂuctuate between two conﬁgurations. Each of which has a double potential well as in Figure 4.2 and some interactions between the dipoles that tend to align them. The detailed microscopic theory of how this happens will be diﬀerent from material to material, but the macroscopic properties of the phase transition will be similar across many diﬀerent classes of materials.
A ﬁrst-order transition is one that has a discontinuity in the order parameter itself, while a second-order transition is one that has a discontinuity in the ﬁrst derivative of the order parameter. In a ﬁrst-order transition, the polarization varies continuously until the Curie temperature (Tc) at which there is a

discontinuity (Figure 4.3a). In a second-order transition, the order parameter itself is a continuous function of temperature, but there is a discontinuity in its ﬁrst derivative at Tc (Figure 4.3b).
4.2.3 Ferroelectric Domains
The spontaneous polarization arises inside the FE materials with equal probability along any of the crystallographic direction when the material is cooled from the paraelectric (PE) to FE phase transition temperature. The directions along which the polarization will develop depend on the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions imposed on the sample. The regions of the crystal with uniformly oriented spontaneous polarization are called FE domains (Figure 4.4). The region between two domains is called the domain wall.
In a newly grown single crystal, there will be many domains with individual polarizations such that there is no overall polarization. They often appear: the polarization of individual domains is organized such that positive heads are held near negative tails. This leads to a reduction in stray ﬁeld energy, because there are fewer isolated heads and tails of domains. This is analogous to the strain energy reduction found in dislocation stacking. The walls that separate domains with oppositely oriented polarization are called 180∘ walls and those that separate regions with mutually perpendicular polarization are called 90∘ walls.
In a polycrystal (one with more than one crystallographic grain), the arrangement of domains depends on grain size. If the grains are ﬁne (≪1 μm), then there is usually found to be one domain per grain. In larger grains there can be more than one domain in each grain. Figure 4.5 displays a micrograph showing the 90∘

Society.)

domains in a single crystal of BaTiO3. In this grain, the domains are twinned in such a way as to reduce the overall stray electric ﬁeld energy. As each domain possesses its own dipole moment, we may switch dipole moments in order to encode information.
The types of domain walls that can occur in an FE crystal depend on the symmetry of both the nonferroelectric and FE phases of the crystal. In the rhombohedral phase of PZT Pb(Zr,Ti)O3, the direction of the polarization develops along the body diagonals (direction ⟨111⟩) of the PE cubic unit cell. This gives eight possible directions of the spontaneous polarization with 180∘, 71∘, and 109∘ domain walls. Observations with transition electron microscopy show that domain walls in FE thin ﬁlms are on the order of 1–10 nm.
4.2.4 Ferroelectric Domain Wall Motion
The most interesting characteristic of FE materials is the polarization reversal or switching of domain wall by an electric ﬁeld. The domain wall switching in FE materials is the occurrence of the polarization hysteresis loop as shown in Figure 4.6. The polarization reversal can be accomplished either by the growth of existing domains antiparallel to the applied ﬁeld by domain wall motion or by the nucleation and growth of new antiparallel domains.
Nucleation usually occurs at particular locations in a sample where a particular polarization direction is favored over another and domains will nucleate at the same sites each time the sample switches (i.e., nucleation is inhomogeneous). The time scale for domain growth varies strongly on the strength of the applied ﬁeld and the material and sample geometry; however it is usually seen that the forward growth of domains occurs ﬁrst and is much faster than the subsequent sideways growth. The domains can grow either along the polar direction or by sideways motion of 180∘ domain walls as shown in Figure 4.7.
The domain structure and the properties of the domain boundaries play an important role in the performance of many FE devices, such as the ferroelectric ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors (FeFETs) [97, 98] and the fast high-density nonvolatile ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAMs) [99]. Mechanical and electrical characteristics, such as the permittivity, coercive ﬁeld, and piezoelectric constants, are often signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced. In particular, the thickness and the interfacial energy of the domain walls are important parameters in understanding

the switching kinetics and fatigue mechanism in FE materials. The width aﬀects the wall mobility, and the energy determines how easily new domain walls may be introduced during polarization reversal processes. The domain nucleation and growth process are aﬀected strongly by extended structural defects (domain walls, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc.) and point defects (vacancies). As a

88 4 Ferroelectricity
consequence, the switching kinetics is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the density of these defects [100–102]. The domain evolution is determined by the spatial distribution of local ﬁeld produced by various charged systems with wide range of the relaxation times. The knowledge of kinetics of screening processes and sources of the ﬁelds driving the domain evolution is the foundation for the progress in domain engineering. Thus, for a thorough understanding of the physical processes associated with the switching and fatigue behavior of an FE material, an accurate microscopic description of the underlying domain walls and their dynamics is very important. Application of high-resolution techniques such as scanning probe microscopy (SPM) in conjunction with conventional electrical measurements provides a unique opportunity to achieve microscopic insight into the physical processes occurring in FE single crystals and thin ﬁlms.
4.3 Classiﬁcation of Ferroelectric Materials
The types of FE materials have been grouped according to their structure. There are four main types of structures: (i) the corner-sharing oxygen octahedra, (ii) compounds containing hydrogen-bonded radicals, (iii) organic polymers, and (iv) Ceramic-polymer composites.
4.3.1 Corner-Sharing Oxygen Octahedra
A large class of FE crystals is made up of mixed oxides containing corner-sharing octahedra of O2− ions schematically shown in Figure 4.8. Inside each octahedron is a cation Bb+ where “b” varies from 3 to 6. The space between the octahedral is occupied by Aa+ ions where “a” varies from 1 to 3. In prototypic forms, the geometric centers of the Aa+, Bb+, and O2− ions coincide, giving rise to a nonpolar lattice. When polarized, the A and B ions are displaced from their geometric centers with respect to the O2− ions to give a net polarity to the lattice. These displacements occur due to the changes in the lattice structure when phase transitions take place as the temperature is changed. The formation of dipoles by the displacement of ions will not lead to spontaneous polarization if there is a compensation pattern of dipoles formed, which produce zero net dipole moment.

The corner-sharing oxygen octahedra include the perovskite-type compounds, tungsten bronze-type compounds, bismuth oxide layer structured compounds, lithium niobate (LN), and lithium tantalite (LT).

4.3.1.1 Perovskite-Type Structures
Perovskite is a family name of a group of materials having the mineral name
of calcium titanate (CaTiO3) exhibiting a structure of the type ABO3. Many piezoelectrics including FE ceramics such as barium titanate (BaTiO3), strontium titanate (STO) (SrTiO3), barium strontium titanate (BST), lead titanate (PbTiO3), PZT, PLZT, PMN, potassium niobate (KN) (KNbO3), potassium sodium niobate (KxNal−xNbO3), and potassium tantalate niobate (KTaxNbl−xO3) have a perovskite-type structure. Most of the aforementioned are discussed in
detail as follows.

4.3.1.1.1 Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) Barium titanate, having a perovskite structure, is a common FE material with a high dielectric constant, widely utilized to manufacture electronic components such as mutilayer capacitors (MLCs), PTC thermistors, piezoelectric transducers, and a variety of electro-optic devices. Pure barium titanate is an insulator, whereas upon doping, it transforms into a semiconductor. Besides Positive Temperature Coeﬃcient Resistance (PTCR) RAM properties, semiconductor barium titanate is used in the sensor applications. The ferroelectricity observed in barium titanate is utilized in memory applications, that is, RAMs. The pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity are also used in the passive IR detectors and sonars. Barium titanate is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula BaTiO3. It is a white powder and is transparent as larger crystals. This titanate is an FE ceramic material with a photorefractive eﬀect and piezoelectric properties.
The solid BaTiO3 can exist in ﬁve phases, listing from high temperature to low temperature: hexagonal, cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral crystal structure. All of the phases exhibit the FE eﬀect except the cubic phase.
The crystallographic dimensions of the barium titanate lattice change with temperature, due to distortion of the TiO6 octahedra as the temperature is lowered from the high-temperature cubic form [104]. Because the distorted octahedra are coupled together, there is a very large spontaneous polarization, giving rise to a large dielectric constant. Above 120 ∘C, Curie point Tc, barium titanate ceramic is cubic structure acting isotropic (Figure 4.9). The Ti atoms are all in equilibrium positions in the center of their octahedra [106]. Shifting of Ti atom due to applied electric ﬁelds could cause the structure to be altered, creating electric dipoles. For example, when temperature is below the Curie temperature, the octahedral structure changes from cubic to tetrahedral symmetry, and the position of

the titanium ion becomes an oﬀ-center position corresponding to a permanent electrical dipole.
As the temperature is changed, the crystallographic dimensions change due to distortion of the octahedra, resulting in octahedra being coupled together and having a very large spontaneous polarization that leads to a large dielectric constant. The spontaneous polarization is along one of the ⟨001⟩ directions in the original cubic structure. Below 5 and −90 ∘C, the orthorhombic phase is stable with the polarization along one of the ⟨110⟩ directions in the original cubic structure. On decreasing the temperature below −90 ∘C, the phase transition from the orthorhombic to rhombohedral phase leads to polarization along one of the ⟨111⟩ cubic directions. These sensitive crystallographic ﬂuctuations with the temperature are shown in Figure 4.10.
BaTiO3 was the ﬁrst material used for manufacturing dielectric ceramics capacitors, MLCs, and so on. It is used for this application due to its high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss. The values of the dielectric constant depend on the synthesis route, which means purity, density, grain size, and so on [107]. The dielectric constant is also dependent on temperature, frequency, and dopants. Figure 4.11 shows the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant measured with a small ﬁeld along the pseudo-cubic edge [106, 108]. In this ﬁgure,

only the values of the dielectric constant in the tetragonal phase have a clear meaning, as they were measured on carefully selected single-domain crystals with the proper orientation.
The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant was reported in a number of papers, where barium titanate was prepared by diﬀerent types of synthesis [109–116].
Kim and Han [117] reported in their work the inﬂuence of grain size on the dielectric constant value. They prepared barium titanate powder by the Pechini process and obtained powders with various grain sizes, from 0.86 to 10 μm, and measured the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant. At room temperature, the dielectric constant was 4500 and 1800, and at the Curie point, 6200 and 7000, for 0.86 and 10 μm grains, respectively. They concluded that as the grain size increased, the dielectric constant decreased at most studied temperatures, and they determined that the specimen with grain sizes of 0.86 μm exhibited the highest dielectric constant for the temperature range below the Curie point. Boulos et al. [110] also investigated the inﬂuence of grain size on the dielectric constant, but in their case, barium titanate ceramics was prepared by the hydrothermal method. They concluded that the dielectric constant increases as the grain size is reduced from 10 to 1 μm, so the results are mainly related to the grain size and to the grain size distribution. Benlahrache et al. [118] show results obtained by measuring the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant (Figure 4.12) in pure BaTiO3 prepared by the conventional procedure of milling and calcination. Measurements were performed in samples sintered at 1500 ∘C for 2 h with the applied bias of 100 V. At room temperature the dielectric constant decreases for frequencies below 1 kHz, but for higher frequencies, the dielectric constant changes slightly and tends toward a constant value. At higher temperatures, the dielectric constant decreases.
The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and also other properties can be modiﬁed by forming a solid solution over a wide range of compositions. The perovskite structure has the capability to host ions of diﬀerent

sizes, so a large number of diﬀerent dopants can be accommodated in the BaTiO3 lattice. For many years, A- and B-site dopants have been used to modify the electrical properties of BaTiO3 [119]. Acceptor dopants are usually monovalent, divalent, and trivalent ions that substitute Ba2+, and barium titanate becomes a p-type semiconductor, but substitution of Ti4+ ions with donor dopants, trivalent, tetravalent, and pentavalent ions barium titanate becomes a n-type semiconductor. Addition of donor dopants at a relatively low concentration leads to room-temperature semiconducting ceramics, whereas higher dopant contents lead to insulating materials. For example, substitution of Pb2+, Sr2+, Ca2+, and Cd2+ can be made for part of the Ba2+ ions, maintaining the FE characteristics. Similarly, the Ti4+ ion can be partially replaced with Sn4+, Hf4+, Zr4+, Ce4+, and Th4+ [120].
During the years, barium titanate-based ceramics found wide application in all the areas of engineering. Some of the applications are described here:
1) MLCs: High values of dielectric constant make BaTiO3 ceramic a popular choice for use in capacitors. The ﬁrst MLCs made from polycrystalline BaTiO3 ceramics were produced in the early 1950s. A multilayer ceramic capacitor is depicted in Figure 4.13 [121]. Due to growing requirements for miniaturization, the MLC structure enables the maximum capacitance available from a thin dielectric to be packed into the minimum space in a mechanically robust form [122]. Multilayer ceramic capacitors possessing high capacitance of 1–100 μF can be engineered into passive components in circuits for Large Scale Integration (LSI), replacing the widely used tantalum capacitors and aluminum electrolytic capacitors. Recently, nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) internal electrodes have been increasingly produced to replace the expensive Ag–Pd electrodes, due to demand of cost reduction. The so-called base metal–electrode process requires a nonreducible BaTiO3 dielectric that can be ﬁred in a reducing atmosphere to prevent the electrodes from oxidation. In recent years, MLCs with Ni internal

electrodes, which are composed of 500 or more laminated thin dielectric layers of ∼2 μm, have been produced [123]. 2) PTC thermistor: The PTC resistance is a kind of PTC thermistor, mainly made up of BaTiO3 ceramics. BaTiO3 ceramics is a kind of typical FE material with a resistivity of greater than 1012 Ω cm. After doping with trivalent donors (e.g., La, Sb, Y) that substitute for Ba2+ or with pentavalent donors (e.g., Nb, Ta) that substitute for Ti4+, BaTiO3 becomes semiconductive. Under normal temperature, through semiconductor doping, it has a strong PTC eﬃcacy – it has extremely low resistance under normal temperature rises. This is because a barrier layer induced by the surface state exists on the crystal particle border of the multi-crystal BaTiO3 semiconductor material. Under Curie temperature, the high-resistance crystal boundary has FE characteristics with great dielectric constant and low potential barrier, electrons can easily penetrate the potential barrier, and corresponding materials have low resistivity. Above Curie temperature, crystal lattice occurs at the high-resistance layer, and the FE constant decreases quickly. The potential barrier increases because the dielectric constant drops in accordance with the Curie–Weiss law. With the dramatic increase of the barrier height, it becomes diﬃcult for electrons to pass potential barrier, and the resistivity of the corresponding materials rises dramatically. This behaves as the PTC eﬃcacy of the material in a macro manner. Due to this property, the PTC thermistor prepared from doped semiconducting BaTiO3 ceramics can be widely used in various kinds of electronic circuitry as a switching device or as a constant temperature heater (Figure 4.14). Other important application of a PTC thermistor is the measurement/detection/control of temperature or parameters related to temperature. These PTC materials are known to have the highest temperature coeﬃcient of resistance among all sensor materials available. 3) NG: Barium titanate is a particularly attractive material for the fabrication of NG due to its lead-free biocompatibility with high piezoelectricity. In 2010, Park et al. demonstrated the use of BaTiO3 thin ﬁlms on a ﬂexible substrate for the conversation of mechanical energy into electrical energy for the ﬁrst time [72]. The FE BaTiO3 thin ﬁlms were deposited by radio-frequency (RF)

magnetron sputtering on a Pt/Ti/SiO2(100) Si substrate and poled under an electric ﬁeld of 100 kV cm−1. The metal–insulator (BaTiO3)–metal-structured ribbons were transferred onto a ﬂexible substrate and connected by interdigitated electrodes. When periodically deformed by a bending stage, the ﬂexible NG produced an output voltage of up to ∼1.0 V and a current signal of up to ∼26 nA with output current density up to ∼0.19 μA cm−2 and power density up to ∼7 mW cm−3.
In 2012, Park et al. fabricated a ﬂexible nanocomposite generator (NCG) device based on BaTiO3 nanoparticles (NPs) and graphite carbons [73]. The NCG achieved a simple, low-cost, and large-area fabrication based on BaTiO3 NPs synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction and graphitic carbons, such as single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SW/MWCNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The BaTiO3 NPs and carbon nanomaterials are dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by mechanical agitation to produce a piezoelectric nanocomposite (p-NC). The p-NC is spin-casted onto metal-coated plastic substrates and cured in an oven. Under periodic external mechanical deformation by bending stage or biomechanical movements from the ﬁnger/feet of human body, electric signals are repeatedly generated with an open-circuit voltage of ∼3.2 V and a short-circuit current signal of 250–350 nA from the NCG device and used to operate a commercial red LED.
In 2012, Lin et al. developed a simple, cost-eﬀective, and scalable approach to fabricate a piezoelectric NG with stretchable and ﬂexible characteristics using BaTiO3 nanotubes that were synthesized by the hydrothermal method [74]. The NG was fabricated by making a composite of the nanotubes with polymer PDMS. The peak open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of the NG reached a high level of 5.5 V and 350 nA (current density of 350 nA cm−2) under a stress of 1 MPa, respectively. It was used to directly drive a commercial liquid crystal display (LCD). The BaTiO3 nanotube/PDMS composite is highly transparent and useful for a large-scale (11 cm × 11 cm) fabrication of lead-free piezoelectric NG.
The NG mainly consists of ﬁve layers as schematically shown in Figure 4.15a. The deposited Au/Cr ﬁlms act as top and bottom electrodes; the BaTiO3 nanotubes and PDMS composite mixed with a 3 wt% ratio serve as the source of piezoelectric potential generation under external stress. The polystyrene (PS) substrate and pure PDMS worked as the supporting and protecting layers to sustain the conformation of NG. Figure 4.15b shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a 300 μm thick BaTiO3 nanotube/PDMS composite, which demonstrates the ﬂexible property of the developed NG. A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image depicted in Figure 4.15c reveals the high purity of BaTiO3 nanotubes with 11.8 (±2.3) nm in diameter and 4.1 (±1.2) μm in length. The BaTiO3 nanotubes were formed by rolling of BaTiO3 multi-sheets (normally three to ﬁve layers) with an interlayer distance of 0.8 nm as shown in Figure 4.15d. The Raman spectroscopy of the prepared NPs displays bands that are suggestive of a tetragonal phase as shown in Figure 4.15e.
In 2013, Jeong et al. designed a ﬂexible NG using BaTiO3 nanocrystals synthesized on an M13 viral template through the genetically programmed

self-assembly of metal ion precursors [75]. The ﬁlamentous viral template realizes the formation of a highly entangled, well-dispersed network of anisotropic BaTiO3 nanostructures with high crystallinity and piezoelectricity. Even without the use of additional structural stabilizers, virus-enabled ﬂexible NG exhibits a high electrical output up to ∼300 nA and ∼6 V, indicating the importance of nanoscale structures for device performances. This study shows the biotemplating approach as a facile method to design and fabricate nanoscale materials particularly suitable for ﬂexible energy-harvesting applications.
To harvest energy using the piezoelectric virus-templated BTO, a well-established NG fabrication process is utilized, as illustrated by the schematics of Figure 4.16a. The stirred and inﬁltrated virus-templated BTO nanostructures are mixed with PDMS to achieve the BTO piezoelectric layer (Figure 4.16a-i). The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated thick (∼175 μm) polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate is covered with PDMS dielectric layer to prevent the electric breakdown of device (Figure 4.16a-ii). The virus-templated BTO-based piezoelectric layer (∼200 μm in thickness) was spin-casted on a PDMS-coated ﬂexible substrate. For the top electrode, an ITO-deposited thin PET substrate (∼50 μm) is subsequently placed on the piezoelectric layer (Figure 4.16a-iii). Figure 4.16a-iv shows the photograph of fabricated virus-templated BTO NG that is malleable and ﬂexible. Due to the anisotropic structure of M13, the well-percolated nanoclusters of the virus-templated BTO were well distributed in a soft elastomeric matrix without any dispersion agents, as shown in the high-resolution SEM image of Figure 4.16a-v.
Figure 4.16b shows the output performance of the virus-templated BTO NG by periodical bending/releasing motion. The short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage measured from the NG device with an eﬀective area of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 reach
