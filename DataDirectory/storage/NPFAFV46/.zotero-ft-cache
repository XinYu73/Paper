We investigate the robustness of entanglement for a multiqubit system under dephasing and bit ﬂip channels. We exhibit the difference between the entanglement evolution of the two forms of special states, which are locally unitarily equivalent to each other and therefore possess precisely the same entanglement properties, and demonstrate that the difference increases with the number of qubits n. Moreover, those two forms of states are either the most robust genuine entangled states or the most fragile ones, which conﬁrm that local unitary (LU) operations can greatly enhance the entanglement robustness of n-qubit states.

Quantum entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics.[1,2] It is a major resource
for quantum information processing (QIP), such as quantum computation,[3,4] quantum teleportation,[5,6] quantum key distribution,[7–9] and distributed quantum learning.[10] Re-

tanglement dynamics of the generalized N-qubit GHZ states under the amplitude-damping channel, some authors afﬁrm that the entanglement robustness can be enhanced by local unitary (LU) operations though the amount of entanglement itself cannot.[28] However, they did not discuss to what extent the ro-

cently, much attention has been paid to the unavoidable degradation of entanglement due to decoherence in realistic environment.[11–13] The entanglement of a bipartite quantum system can decay to zero abruptly under the effect of local environment, which is a well-known decoherence phenomena named as entanglement sudden death (ESD).[14–17] It was shown that the ESD is related to the type of initial state.[18,19]
There are many excellent papers have been devoted to the study of the robustness of various bipartite[20,21] and multipartite entangled states under different decoherence models.[22–26] It is possible to calculate the exact value of

bustness of entanglement can be enhanced. It is of theoretical interest and has potential application in accomplishing some quantum task.
In this paper, we investigate the robustness of n-qubit states under the dephasing and the bit ﬂip channels. Negativity corresponding to the partitions “the ﬁrst qubit versus the rest” will be used as the entanglement quantiﬁer. We show how the entanglement evolution of two forms of special states, which are local-unitarily equivalent to each other and therefore possess precisely the same amount and type of entangle-

We also ﬁnd that the two forms of states exhibit the most signiﬁcant different robustness by comparing with random states, which further conﬁrm the important fact that the entanglement robustness of an n-qubit system can be greatly enhanced by LU operations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy introduce our environment models and entanglement measure for some special multiqubit systems. In Sections 3 and 4 we investigate the robustness of entanglement under the dephasing and the bit ﬂip channels, respectively. Finally, we summa-

2. Noise models and entanglement measure

We consider a multi-qubit system interacting with dephasing and bit ﬂip channels, respectively. We assume that each qubit in the composite system is coupled to its own noisy environment and there is no interaction between qubits. That is, all qubits are affected by the same decoherence process. The dynamics of a single qubit is governed by a master equation that gives rise to a completely positive trace-preserving map (or channel) ε describing the corresponding evolution:[23] ρi(t) = ε(t)ρi(0). In the Born–Markovian approximation, the channel can be described by a set of Kraus operators[23,30,31] as

M

∑ ε(ρi(0)) = E ji(t)ρi(0)E†ji(t),

(1)

j=1

eigenvalues µi < 0 and positive eigenvalues µ j > 0, it satisﬁes tr[ρTA ] = ∑i µi + ∑ j µ j = 1, thus its trace norm reads in general ‖ρTA ‖1 = |∑i µi| + ∑ j µ j = 1 + 2 |∑i µi| ≡ 1 + 𝒩 (ρ).
Therefore, the negativity 𝒩 (ρ) is deﬁned as twice the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of ρTA .

3. Robustness of entanglement under dephasing channel

3.1. Evolution of special states under dephasing channel

The dephasing channel reﬂects the decay of non-diagonal elements of density matrix with time. In this channel, we focus ﬁrst on the n-qubit system in the form of pure states

∑ |Ψ n⟩ = √ 1
2n−2

cos θ |0⟩ ⊗ Pi|i2, i3, . . . , in⟩
Pi

where E j(t) ( j = 1, . . . , M) are the Kraus operators needed to completely characterize the channel which fulﬁll the normalization condition ∑ j E†j (t)E j(t) = I.
We start by discussing the dephasing channel, which can be also regarded as a phase ﬂip channel. It describes the loss of quantum coherence without any exchange of energy. The Kraus operators for the dephasing channel are

E0 =

1√ 0 0 1 − pd

,

E1 =

0 √0 0 pd

.

(2)

Another type of environment to be dealt with is bit ﬂip channel. The corresponding Kraus operators can be given by

+ i sin θ |1⟩ ⊗ ∑ Pj| j2, j3, . . . , jn⟩ ,

(5)

Pj

where θ ∈ [0, π/2]. ik, jk = 0, 1 and k = 2, 3, . . . , n with odd numbers of {ik} and even numbers of { jk} taking 1, respectively. P means all possible permutations of {ik} and { jk}. The initial entanglement of the above states (5) can be simply
derived as 𝒩0 = sin 2θ . In the following, we take the example of a four-qubit sys-
tem in the pure state |Ψ 4⟩ to calculate its negativity under the
dephasing channel. We note that the negativity of the states (5)
with n = 4 is determined by the partial transposed density matrix ρΨTA4 (t). The nonzero diagonal matrix elements of ρΨTA4 (t) are given by

E0 =

1 − pbf 2

10 01

,

E1 =

pbf 2

01 10

.

(3)

The parameter pd, pbf in channels (2) and (3) can also be interpreted as the degree of decoherence of an individual particle
in multiqubit system with pd, pbf ∈ [0, 1], where pd, pbf = 0 means no decoherence and pd, pbf = 1 complete decoherence. The factor of 2 in Eq. (3) guarantees that at pbf = 1 the ignorance about the occurrence of an error is maximal, and as a consequence, the information about the state is minimal.[30]
To examine the bipartite entanglement dynamics for nqubit states, we use negativity 𝒩 (ρ)[32–34] as the measure of entanglement between the ﬁrst qubit q1 and the rest ones Qn−1 (hereafter denoted by q1|Qn−1). Negativity is extensively used in study of the multipartite entanglement dynamics, though it
cannot detect the positive partial transpose (PPT) entangled states. Based on the trace norm ‖ρTA ‖1 of the partially transposed density matrix ρTA of a mixed state ρ, the entanglement can be written as[34,35]

The negativity corresponding to the bipartition q1|Qn−1 for the state |Ψ 4⟩ can be readily calculated as

𝒩 (ρ) = ‖ρTA ‖1 − 1.

Similarly, the negativities for the states |Ψ n⟩ with n = 2, 3, 5, 6,

and 7 are given by

𝒩 (2) = (1 − pd)𝒩0,

𝒩 (7) = 𝒩 (6).

(11)

From Eq. (11), with the same 𝒩0, the entanglement for the states |Ψ n⟩ in Eq. (5) does not decrease with n, namely,
𝒩 (2) = 𝒩 (3) ≤ 𝒩 (4) = 𝒩 (5) ≤ 𝒩 (6) = 𝒩 (7). (12)

In other words, the entanglement of |Ψ n⟩ does not become more fragile when the size of system increases.
Next, we discuss the other form of pure states for an arbitrary n-qubit system

|Φn⟩ = e iθ (|0⟩⊗n + |1⟩⊗n) 2
+ e−iθ (|0⟩|1⟩⊗(n−1) + |1⟩|0⟩⊗(n−1)), (13) 2
where θ ∈ [0, π/2]. These states are related to the states |Ψ n⟩ by an LU transformation as

|Φn⟩ = H1⊗(n−1) ⊗ H2|Ψ n⟩,

(14)

with

H1 = √1 2

11 1 −1

, H2 = √1 2

11 −1 1

,

(15)

which are both the Hadamard matrices. That is, |Φn⟩ are LU-equivalent to |Ψ n⟩. Therefore, these two special forms
of states possess precisely the same amount and type of entan-

glement in absence of decoherence. Speciﬁcally, the bipartite

entanglement of the initial states (13) can also be expressed as

𝒩0 = sin 2θ . The partial transposed density matrix ρΦTAn (t) under the
dephasing channel is given by

∑ ρΦTAn (t)

=

1 4 i=0,1

(|i⟩⟨i|)⊗n + |i⟩⟨i| ⊗ (|1 − i⟩⟨1 − i|)⊗(n−1)

+ e2iθ |i⟩⟨1 − i| ⊗ (|1 − i⟩⟨1 − i|)⊗(n−1)s1/2

+ |i⟩⟨i| ⊗ (|i⟩⟨1 − i|)⊗(n−1)s(n−1)/2 + h.c. , (16)

here h.c. represents the hermitian conjugate of the previous terms. The matrix has only one negative eigenvalue which is determined by the following 4 × 4 matrix:

The negativities corresponding to the bipartition q1|Qn−1 for the states in Eq. (13) can be expressed as

𝒩 (n) = max

1 0,
2

(1 − pd)n/2 +

(4𝒩02 − 2)(1 − pd)n/2 + (1 − pd)n−1 + 1 − p − 1

.

(18)

Contrary to the case of |Ψ n⟩, the negativities of |Φn⟩ do not increase with n according to Eq. (18), namely,

𝒩 (n+1) ≤ 𝒩 (n).

(19)

It indicates that, unlike |Ψ n⟩, the entanglement of |Φn⟩ which can be transformed into |Ψ n⟩ by local operations, does not become more robust with the increase of n. For comparison, with θ = π/4, we display in Fig. 1 the entanglement evolutions of |Ψ n⟩ with solid lines or dashed dot dot lines and |Φn⟩ with dashed lines for the systems with n = 2, 3, . . . , 7 , respectively (shown with gray, pink, blue, green, orange, black curves, respectively), under the local dephasing channel. From Fig. 1, one can see clearly that the entanglement evolutions of both the two forms of states change with n and so do the differences of entanglement evolutions between the two forms. Furthermore, it suggests that LU operations which do not change the entanglement properties of a state can enhance the robustness of an n-qubit system against decoherence.

3.2. Robustness of multiqubit pure states under the dephasing channel
In our previous work,[27] we found that the state |Ψ 3⟩ in Eq. (5) is the most robust entangled state, and the state |Φ3⟩ in

Eq. (13) is the most fragile entangled one under the dephasing channel. Now, we turn to the decoherence process of all nqubit pure states under the dephasing channel with numerical calculation. The remaining negativity 𝒩 of a state which is affected by the ﬁxed decoherence noise is used as the quantiﬁer of robustness. By taking a four-qubit system as an example, we sample 3 × 104 random four-qubit entangled pure states with the Haar measure[36] and compute their remaining entanglements with pd taking the values 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, and 4/8, respectively. The corresponding remaining negativities 𝒩 are plotted in Figs. 2(a)–2(d) with gray solid dots. In addition, according to Eq. (10) and Eq. (18), one can easily get the relation between 𝒩 and 𝒩0 with the same values of pd corresponding to the state |Ψ 4⟩ in Eq. (5) and the state |Φ4⟩ in Eq. (13). In Figs. 2(a)–2(d), the remaining negativities are depicted with red solid lines for state |Ψ 4⟩ and olive dashed lines for state |Φ 4 ⟩.

4. Robustness of entanglement under bit ﬂip channel
4.1. Evolution of special states under bit ﬂip channel
The bit ﬂip channel is the same as the dephasing channel under the local rotational transformation. It ﬂips the state of a qubit between |0⟩ and |1⟩ with a certain probability and each qubit is affected by the noise correspondingly. The states |Φn⟩ in Eq. (13) and |Ψ n⟩ in Eq. (5), which can be transformed into each other by local operations and manifest the most signiﬁcant difference in robustness under the dephasing channel, are worth to be investigated further for this channel. Similarly, we also take the example of the pure states |Φ4⟩ and |Ψ 4⟩ to calculate the negativities under the bit ﬂip channel. We need to write the nonzero elements of the partial transposed density matrix ρΦTA4 (t) and ρΨTA4 (t) during the evolution, which are given in Appendix A. Here the negativities expressions of |Φn⟩ with n = 2, 3, . . . , 7, are straightforwardly provided as follows:

bustness of the state when the dephasing noise pd = 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, and 4/8 in panels (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. The same behavior is displayed
for all other noise parameters and for systems with n = 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

In Fig. 2, the remaining negativities 𝒩 of 3 × 104 random four-qubit pure states display ribbon distributions. The red solid lines are the upper bounds; while the olive dashed lines are the lower bounds. In other words, state |Ψ 4⟩ is the most robust entangled state, while state |Φ4⟩ is the most fragile one for the four-qubit system during decoherence under the dephasing channel, although they are LU-equivalent with each other. The results imply that the suitable LU operations can enhance the robustness of entanglement to the max. We also explored the dephasing process of another multiqubit pure state with n = 2, 5, 6, and 7, and obtain the same result. Therefore, we suppose that the conclusion is universal for n-qubit entanglement corresponding to the bipartition q1|Qn−1.

The negativities between the bipartition q1|Qn−1 for the states |Ψ n⟩ under the bit ﬂip channel are given by

With the same 𝒩0, the entanglement evolutions of |Φn⟩ and |Ψ n⟩ for the systems with n = 2, 3, . . . , 7 under the bit ﬂip channel have the same features as Eq. (12) and Eq. (19), respectively. When θ = π/4, the curves of negativity versus pbf are plotted for |Φn⟩ with solid lines or dashed dot dot lines and for |Ψ n⟩ with dashed lines in Fig. 3 for the systems with n = 2, 3, . . . , 7, respectively (shown with gray, pink, blue,
green, orange, black curves, respectively). From the ﬁgure,
one can see obviously that there are differences in the evolu-
tion of entanglement, although the corresponding two forms
of states are LU-equivalent, and the difference increases with qubits n. Furthermore, the states |Φn⟩ are more robust than the states |Ψ n⟩ under the bit ﬂip channel.

der the bit ﬂip channel. We plot the remaining negativities characterizing
robustness of the state when the bit ﬂip noise pbf = 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, and 4/8 in panels (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. The same behavior is displayed
for all other noise parameters and for systems with n = 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

From the ﬁgure, one can see that there is a ribbon distribution for 𝒩 of 3 × 104 random four-qubit pure states. Since the
same unitary operation also connects the bit ﬂip channel with the dephasing channel, the state |Φ4⟩ is the most robust entangled state, while the state |Ψ 4⟩ is the most fragile one under the bit ﬂip channel. For the cases of n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, we have

the same results. We suppose that the conclusion is universal for n-qubit entanglement corresponding to the bipartition q1|Qn−1.

5. Conclusion
In summary, we have investigated the robustness of entanglement for a multiqubit system under the dephasing and the bit ﬂip channels. We explore the entanglement evolutions of two forms of special n-qubit states |Ψ n⟩ and |Φn⟩ which are LU-equivalent to each other and therefore posses precisely the same amount and type of entanglement. For the dephasing channel, with n = 2, 3, . . . , 7, the robustness of the states |Ψ n⟩ does not decrease with n, while for the states |Φn⟩, the robustness does not increase with the size of system. The larger number of qubits a system has, the greater distinction the entanglement evolution of those states manifests. Moreover, by comparing the remaining negativities of the special quantum states with that of random pure states, we ﬁnd that the states |Ψ n⟩ are the most robust states and the states |Φn⟩ are the most fragile ones.
Similarly, for bit ﬂip channel, the states |Φn⟩ and |Ψ n⟩ also exhibit the most signiﬁcant difference in robustness, but, contrary to the case of the dephasing channel, the states |Φn⟩ are the most robust states, while the states |Ψ n⟩ are the most fragile ones. Remarkably, our results suggest that the robustness of an arbitrary n-qubit system under decoherence can be greatly enhanced by LU operations. It might provide a possible way in protecting the robust n-qubit states against decoherence through appropriate LU operations.
