Recent interest in aspects common to quantum information and condensed matter has prompted a ﬂurry of activity at the border of these disciplines that were far distant until a few years ago. Numerous interesting questions have been addressed so far. Here an important part of this ﬁeld, the properties of the entanglement in many-body systems, are reviewed. The zero and ﬁnite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermion, and boson model systems are discussed. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. In equilibrium entanglement is shown tightly connected to the characteristics of the phase diagram. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test. Out of equilibrium entangled states are generated and manipulated by means of many-body Hamiltonians.

I. INTRODUCTION
Entanglement expresses the “spooky” nonlocality inherent to quantum mechanics ͑Bell, 1987͒. Because of that, it gave rise to severe skepticisms since the early days of quantum mechanics. It was only after the seminal contribution of John Bell that the fundamental questions related to the existence of entangled states could be tested experimentally. In fact, under fairly general assumptions, Bell derived a set of inequalities for correlated measurements of two physical observables that any local theory should obey. The overwhelming majority of experiments done so far are in favor of quantum mechanics thus demonstrating that quantum entanglement is physical reality ͑Peres, 1993͒.1
Entanglement has gained renewed interest with the development of quantum information science ͑Nielsen and Chuang, 2000͒. In its framework, quantum entanglement is viewed as a resource in quantum information processing. It is, e.g., believed to be the main ingredient of the quantum speed-up in quantum computation and communication. Moreover, several quantum protocols, such as teleportation ͑Bennett et al., 1993͒ just to mention an important example, can be realized exclusively with the help of entangled states.
The role of entanglement as a resource in quantum

information has stimulated intensive research trying to unveil both its qualitative and quantitative aspects ͑Plenio and Vedral, 1998; Wootters, 2001; Bruß, 2002; Vedral, 2002; Bengtsson and Zyczkowski, 2006; Eisert, 2006; Horodecki et al., 2007; Plenio and Virmani, 2007͒. To this end, necessary criteria for any entanglement measure to be fulﬁlled have been elaborated and lead to the notion of an entanglement monotone ͑Vidal, 2000͒ allowing one to attach a precise number to the entanglement encoded in a given state. There is a substantial bulk of work for bipartite systems, in particular for the case of qubits. Many criteria have been proposed to distinguish separable from entangled pure states, as, for example, the Schmidt rank and the von Neumann entropy. The success in the bipartite case for qubits asked for extensions to the multipartite case, but the situation proved to be far more complicated: Different classes of entanglement occur, which are inequivalent not only under deterministic local operations and classical communication, but even under their stochastic analog ͑Bennett et al., 2001͒.
In the last few years it has become evident that quantum information may lead to further insight into other areas of physics as statistical mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory ͑Preskill, 2000͒. The attention of the quantum information community to systems studied in condensed matter has stimulated an exciting crossfertilization between the two areas. Methods developed in quantum information have proved to be extremely useful in the analysis of the state of many-body systems.
At T = 0 many-body systems are often described by a complex ground state wave function which contains all correlations that give rise to the various phases of matter ͑superconductivity, ferromagnetism, quantum Hall systems, etc.͒. Traditionally many-body systems have been studied by looking, for example, at their response to external perturbations, various order parameters, and excitation spectrum. The study of the ground state of many-body systems with methods developed in quantum information may unveil new properties. At the same time experience built up over the years in condensed matter is helping in ﬁnding new protocols for quantum computation and communication: A quantum computer is a many-body system where, different from traditional ones, the Hamiltonian can be controlled and manipulated.
The amount of work at the interface between statistical mechanics and quantum information has grown during the last few years, shining light on many different aspects of both subjects. In particular, there has been extensive analysis of entanglement in quantum critical models ͑Osborne and Nielsen, 2002; Osterloh et al., 2002; Vidal et al., 2003͒. Tools from quantum information theory also provided support for numerical methods, such as the density matrix renormalization group or the design of new efﬁcient simulation strategies for many-body systems ͑see, for example, Verstraete, Porras, and Cirac, 2004; Vidal, 2003, 2004͒. Spin networks have been proposed as quantum channels ͑Bose, 2003͒ by exploiting the collective dynamics of their low lying

excitations for transporting quantum information. Despite being at its infancy, this new area of research
has grown so fast that a description of the whole ﬁeld is beyond the scope of a single review. Many interesting facets of this branch of research will therefore remain untouched here. In this review we only discuss the properties of entanglement in many-body systems. The models which will be considered include interacting spin networks, itinerant fermions, harmonic and bosonic systems. All of them are of paramount interest in condensed matter physics.
This review is organized as follows. In the next section we give a brief overview on the concepts and measures of entanglement, with particular attention to those measures that we use later. In Sec. III we then proceed with an introduction to several models of interacting manybody systems which will be the subject of the review. We discuss various aspects of quantum correlations starting from the pairwise entanglement, Sec. IV, we then proceed with the properties of block entropy, Sec. V, and localizable entanglement, Sec. VI. In these three sections it is especially relevant the connection between entanglement and quantum phase transitions. The effect of a ﬁnite temperature is considered in Sec. VII. The characterization of entanglement in many-body systems requires also the understanding of multipartite entanglement. This topic will be reviewed in Sec. VIII. From the point of view of quantum information processing, dynamical properties of entanglement are important as well. They will be addressed in Sec. IX. The conclusions, the outlook, and a very short panorama of what is left out from this review are presented in the concluding section.
II. MEASURES OF ENTANGLEMENT
The problem of measuring entanglement is a vast and lively ﬁeld of research of its own. Numerous different methods have been proposed for its quantiﬁcation. In this section we do not attempt to give an exhaustive review of the ﬁeld. Rather we introduce those measures that are largely being used to quantify entanglement in many-body systems. Comprehensive overviews of entanglement measures can be found in Plenio and Vedral ͑1998͒; Wootters ͑2001͒; Bruß ͑2002͒; Vedral ͑2002͒; Bengtsson and Zyczkowski ͑2006͒; Eisert ͑2006͒; Horodecki et al. ͑2007͒; Plenio and Virmani ͑2007͒. In this context, we also outline a method of detecting entanglement, based on entanglement witnesses.
A. Bipartite entanglement in pure states
Bipartite entanglement of pure states is conceptually well understood, although quantifying it for local dimensions higher than two still bears theoretical challenges ͑Virmani and Plenio, 2000; Horodecki et al., 2007͒. A pure bipartite state is not entangled if and only if it can be written as a tensor product of pure states of the parts. Moreover, for every pure bipartite state ͉␺AB͘ ͑with the

two parts, A and B͒, two orthonormal bases ͕͉␺A,i͖͘ and ͕͉␾B,j͖͘ exist such that ͉␺AB͘ can be written as

͚ ͉␺AB͘ = ␣i͉␺A,i͉͘␾B,i͘,

͑1͒

i

where ␣i are positive coefﬁcients. This decomposition is called the Schmidt decomposition and the parti-
cular basis coincides with the eigenbasis of the corresponding reduced density operators ␳B/A = trA/B͉͑␺AB͒͘ = ͚i␣i2͉␺B/A,i͗͘␺B/A,i͉. The density operators ␳A and ␳B have a common spectrum, in particular, they are equally
mixed. Since only product states lead to pure reduced
density matrices, a measure for their mixedness points a
way towards quantifying entanglement in this case. Given the state ͉␺AB͘, we can thus take its Schmidt decomposition, Eq. ͑1͒, and use a suitable function ␣i to quantify the entanglement.
An entanglement measure E is ﬁxed uniquely after
imposing the following conditions: ͑1͒ E is invariant under local unitary operations ͑⇒E is indeed a function of the ␣i’s only͒; ͑2͒ E is continuous ͓in a certain sense also in the asymptotic limit of inﬁnite copies of the state; see,
e.g., Plenio and Virmani ͑2007͔͒; and ͑3͒ E is additive, when several copies of the system are present: E͉͑␺AB͘  ͉␾AB͒͘ = E͉͑␺AB͒͘ + E͉͑␾AB͒͘. The unique measure of entanglement satisfying the above conditions is the von
Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices:

͚ S͑␳A͒ = S͑␳B͒ = − ␣i2 log͑␣i2͒,

͑2͒

i

this is just the Shannon entropy of the moduli squared of the Schmidt coefﬁcients. In other words: under the above regularity conditions, the answer to the question of how entangled a bipartite pure state is, given by the von Neumann entropy of ͑either of͒ the reduced density matrices. The amount of entanglement is generally difﬁcult to deﬁne once we are away from bipartite states, but in several cases we can still gain some insight into many-party entanglement if one considers different bipartitions of a multipartite system.
It is worth noticing that a variety of purity measures are admissible when the third condition on additivity is omitted. In principle, there are inﬁnitely many measures for the mixedness of a density matrix; two of them will typically lead to a different ordering when the Hilbert space of the parts has a dimension larger than 2.
In contrast, if we trace out one of two qubits in a pure state, the corresponding reduced density matrix ␳A contains only a single independent and unitarily invariant parameter: its eigenvalue ഛ1 / 2. This implies that each monotonic function ͓0 , 1 / 2͔ ‫͓ ۋ‬0 , 1͔ of this eigenvalue can be used as an entanglement measure. Though, also here an inﬁnity of different mixedness measures exists, all lead to the same ordering of states with respect to their entanglement, and in this sense all are equivalent. A relevant example is the ͑one-͒ tangle ͑Coffman et al., 2000͒

By expressing ␳A in terms of spin expectation values,

B. Pairwise qubit entanglement in mixed states

Subsystems of a many-body ͑pure͒ state will generally be in a mixed state. In this case a different way of quantifying entanglement can be introduced. Three impor-
tant representatives are the entanglement cost EC, the distillable entanglement ED ͓both deﬁned by Bennett, Bernstein, et al. ͑1996͔͒, and the entanglement of formation EF ͑Bennett, Di Vincenzo, et al., 1996͒. Whereas ED and EC are asymptotic limits of multicopy extraction probabilities of Bell states and creation from such states, the entanglement of formation is the amount of pure state entanglement needed to create a single copy of the mixed state. Although recent progress has been achieved ͑Paz-Silva and Reina, 2007͒, the full additivity
of the EF for bipartite systems has not been established yet ͓see, e.g., Vidal et al. ͑2002͔͒.
The conceptual difﬁculty behind the calculation of EF lies in the inﬁnite number of possible decompositions of a density matrix. Therefore even knowing how to quantify bipartite entanglement in pure states, we cannot simply apply this knowledge to mixed states in terms of an average over mixtures of pure state entanglement. The problem is that two decompositions of the same density matrix usually lead to a different average entanglement. Which one do we choose? It turns out that we must take the minimum over all possible decompositions, simply because if there is a decomposition where the average is zero, then this state can be created locally without the need of any entangled pure state, and there-
fore EF = 0. The same conclusion can be drawn from the requirement that entanglement must not increase on average by means of local operations including classical communication ͑LOCC͒.
The entanglement of formation of a state ␳ is therefore deﬁned as

͚ EF͑␳͒ ª min pjS͑␳A,j͒,

͑4͒

j

where the minimum is taken over all realizations of the
state ␳AB = ͚jpj͉␺j͗͘␺j͉, and S͑␳A,j͒ is the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix ␳A,j ª trB͉␺j͗͘␺j͉. Equation ͑4͒ is the so-called convex roof ͑also the ex-

pression convex hull is found in the literature͒ of the

entanglement of formation for pure states, and a decom-

position leading to this convex roof value is called an

optimal decomposition.

For systems of two qubits, an analytic expression for

EF is given by

EF͑␳͒ = −
␴=±

ln

,

͑5͒

where C͑␳͒ is the so-called concurrence ͑Wootters, 1998, 2001͒, the convex roof of the pure state concurrence,
which has been deﬁned in the previous section. Its con-
vex roof extension is encoded in the positive Hermitian
matrix R ϵ ͱ␳␳˜ ͱ␳ = ͱ␳͑␴y  ␴y͒␳*͑␴y  ␴y͒ͱ␳, with eigen-
values ␭12 ജ ¯ ജ ␭42 in the following way:

C = max͕␭1 − ␭2 − ␭3 − ␭4,0͖.

͑6͒

As the entanglement of formation is a monotonous
function of the concurrence, also C itself or its square ␶2—called also the 2-tangle—can be used as entanglement measures. This is possible due to a curious peculiarity of two-qubit systems: namely, that a continuous variety of optimal decompositions exist ͑Wootters, 1998͒. The concurrence C and the tangle ␶1 both range from 0 ͑no entanglement͒ to 1.
By virtue of Eq. ͑6͒, the concurrence in a spin-1 / 2 chain can be computed in terms of up to two-point spin correlation functions. As an example we consider a case where the model has a parity symmetry, it is translational invariant, and the Hamiltonian is real; the concurrence in this case reads

Cij = 2 max͕0,CiIj,CiIjI͖,

͑7͒

ͱ where CiIj = ͉gixjx + giyjy͉ − ͑1 / 4 + gizjz͒2 − Mz2 and CiIjI = ͉gixjx
− giyjy͉ + gizjz − 1 / 4, with gi␣j␣ = ͗Si␣Sj␣͘ and Mz = ͗Sz͘. A state with dominant ﬁdelity of parallel and antiparallel Bell

states is characterized by dominant CI and CII, respec-

tively. This was shown by Fubini et al. ͑2006͒, where the

concurrence was expressed in terms of the fully en-

tangled fraction as deﬁned by Bennett, DiVincenzo, et

al. ͑1996͒. Systematic analysis of the relation between

the concurrence ͑together with the 3-tangle, see Sec.

II.E͒ and the correlation functions has been presented

by Glaser et al. ͑2003͒.

The importance of the tangle and concurrence is due

to the monogamy inequality derived in Coffman et al.

͑2000͒ for three qubits. This inequality has been proven

to hold also for n-qubits system ͑Osborne and Verstra-

ete, 2006͒. In the case of many-qubits ͑the tangle may

depend on the site i that is considered͒ it reads

͚ Ci2j ഛ ␶1,i.

͑8͒

ji

The so-called residual tangle ␶1,i − ͚j iCi2j is a measure for multipartite entanglement not stored in pairs of qu-
bits only. We ﬁnally mention that the antilinear form of
the pure state concurrence was the key for the ﬁrst ex-
plicit construction of a convex roof, and hence its exten-

sion to mixed states ͑Hill and Wootters, 1997; Wootters, 1998; Uhlmann, 2000͒.
Another measure of entanglement is the relative entropy of entanglement ͑Vedral et al., 1997͒. It can be applied to any number of qubits in principle ͑or any dimension of the local Hilbert space͒. It is formally deﬁned as E͑␴͒ ª min␳෈D S͑␴ ʈ ␳͒, where S͑␴ ʈ ␳͒ = tr ␴͓ln ␴ − ln ␳͔ is the quantum relative entropy. This relative entropy of entanglement quantiﬁes the entanglement in ␴ by its distance from the set D of separable states ͑since D is compact, the minimum is assumed always͒. The main difﬁculty in computing this measure is to ﬁnd the disentangled state closest to ␳. This is in general an open problem, even for two qubits. In the presence of certain symmetries—which is the case for, e.g., eigenstates of certain models—an analytical access is possible. In these cases, the relative entropy of entanglement becomes a very useful tool. The relative entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy in the case of pure bipartite states; this also means that its convex roof extension coincides with the entanglement of formation, and is readily deduced from the concurrence ͑Wootters, 1998͒.
We close this summary on the pairwise entanglement by commenting on the quantum mutual information. Groisman et al. quantiﬁed the work necessary to erase the total correlations existing in a bipartite system ͑Groisman et al., 2005͒. The entanglement can be erased by a suitable random ensemble of unitary transformations acting on one of the parts, but a certain amount of classical correlation among the two partners may survive. The work necessary to erase all correlations is given by the quantum mutual information

IAB = S͑␳A͒ + S͑␳B͒ − S͑␳AB͒.

͑9͒

C. Localizable entanglement
A different approach to entanglement in many-body systems arises from the quest to swap or transmute different types of multipartite entanglement into pairwise entanglement between two parties by means of generalized measures on the rest of the system. In a system of interacting spins on a lattice one could then try to maximize the entanglement between two spins ͑at positions i and j͒ by performing measurements on all others. The system is then partitioned in three regions: the sites i, j and the rest of the lattice. This concentrated pairwise entanglement can then be used, e.g., for quantum information processing. A standard example is that the three qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ͑GHZ͒ state
͑1 / ͱ2͉͒͑000͘ + ͉111͒͘ after a projective measure in the x
direction on one of the sites is transformed into a Bell state.
The concept of localizable entanglement has been introduced by Verstraete ͑2004͒; Popp et al. ͑2005͒. It is deﬁned as the maximal amount of entanglement that can be localized, on average, by doing local measurements in the rest of the system. In the case of N parties, the possible outcomes of the measurements on the re-

maining N − 2 particles are pure states ͉␺s͘ with corresponding probabilities ps. The localizable entanglement Eloc on sites i and j is deﬁned as the maximum of the average entanglement over all possible outcome states
͉␺s͘ij,

͚ Eloc͑i,j͒ = supE psE͉͑␺s͘ij͒,

͑10͒

s

where E is the set of all possible outcomes ͑ps , ͉␺s͒͘ of measurements and E is the chosen measure of entanglement of a pure state of two qubits ͑e.g., the concurrence͒. Although difﬁcult to compute, lower and upper bounds have been found which allow one to deduce a
number of consequences for this quantity.
An upper bound to the localizable entanglement is given by the entanglement of assistance ͑Laustsen et al., 2003͒ obtained from localizable entanglement when also
global and joint measurements were allowed on the N
− 2 spins. A lower bound of the localizable entanglement comes from the following theorem ͑Verstraete, MartinDelgado, and Cirac, 2004͒: Given a ͑pure or mixed͒ state of N qubits with reduced correlations Qi␣j,␤ = ͗Si␣Sj␤͘ − ͗Si␣͗͘Sj␤͘ between the spins i and j and directions ␣ and ␤ then there always exist directions in which one can measure the other spins such that this correlation does
not decrease, on average. It then follows that a lower
bound to localizable entanglement is ﬁxed by the maximal correlation function between the two parties ͑one of the various spin-spin correlation functions Qi␣j,␤͒.2

D. Entanglement witnesses
It is important to realize that not just the quantiﬁcation of many-party entanglement is a difﬁcult task; it is an open problem to tell, in general, whether a state of n parties is separable or not. It is therefore of great value to have a tool that is able to merely certify if a certain state is entangled. An entanglement witness W is a Hermitian operator which is able to detect entanglement in a state. The basic idea is that the expectation value of the witness W for the state ␳ under consideration exceeds certain bounds only when ␳ is entangled. An expectation value of W within this bound, however, does not guarantee that the state is separable. Nonetheless, this is an appealing method also from an experimental point of view, since it is sometimes possible to relate the presence of the entanglement to the measurement of a few observables.
Simple geometric ideas help to explain the witness operator W at work. Let T be the set of all density matrices and let E and D be the subsets of entangled and sepa-
2It has been argued ͑Gour, 2006; Gour and Spekkens, 2006͒ that in order to extend the entanglement of assistance and localizable entanglement to an entanglement monotone ͑Vidal, 2000͒ one should admit also local operations including classical communication on the extracted two spins, this was named entanglement of collaboration.

rable states, respectively. The convexity of D is a key property for witnessing entanglement. The entangle-
ment witness is then an operator deﬁning a hyperplane
which separates a given entangled state from the set of
separable states. The main scope of this geometric approach is then to optimize the witness operator ͑Lewenstein et al., 2000͒ or to replace the hyperplane by a curved manifold, tangent to the set of separable states ͑Gühne, 2004͒ ͓for other geometric aspects of entanglement see Klyachko ͑2002͒, Bengtsson and Zyczkowski ͑2006͒, and Leinaas et al. ͑2006͔͒. We have the freedom to choose W such that tr͑␳DW͒ ഛ 0 for all disentangled states ␳D ෈ D. Then, tr͑␳W͒ Ͼ 0 implies that ␳ is entangled. A caveat is that the concept of a witness is not invariant under local unitary operations ͓see, e.g., Cavalcanti and Terra-Cunha ͑2005͔͒.
Entanglement witnesses are a special case of a more
general concept, namely that of positive maps. These are
injective superoperators on the subset of positive opera-
tors. When we now think of superoperators that act nontrivially only on part of the system ͑on operators that act nontrivially only on a sub-Hilbert space͒, then we may ask the question whether a positive map on the subspace
is also positive when acting on the whole space. Maps
that remain positive also on the extended space are
called completely positive maps. The Hermitian time
evolution of a density matrix is an example for a com-
pletely positive map. Positive but not completely posi-
tive maps are important for entanglement theory. There
is a remarkable isomorphism between positive maps and Hermitian operators ͑Jamiolkowski, 1972͒. This can be used to prove a key theorem ͑Horodecki et al., 1996͒: A state ␳AB is entangled if and only if a positive map ⌳ exists ͑not completely positive͒ such that ͑1A  ⌳B͒␳AB Ͻ 0. For a two-dimensional local Hilbert space the situ-
ation simpliﬁes considerably in that any positive map P
can be written as P = CP1 + CP2TB, where CP1 and CP2 are completely positive maps and TB is a transposition operation on subspace B. This decomposition tells us
that for a system of two qubits the lack of complete
positivity in a positive map is due to a partial transposi-
tion. This partial transposition clearly leads to a positive
operator if the state is a tensor product of the parts. In fact, also the opposite is true: a state of two qubits ␳AB is separable if and only if ␳ATBB ജ 0 that is, its partial transposition is positive. This is very simple to test and it is known as the Peres-Horodecki criterion ͑Horodecki et al., 1996; Peres, 1996͒. The properties of entangled states under partial transposition lead to a measure of en-
tanglement known as the negativity. The negativity NAB of a bipartite state is deﬁned as the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of ␳ATAB. The logarithmic negativity is then deﬁned as

EN = log2 2͑2NAB + 1͒.

͑11͒

For bipartite states of two qubits, ␳ATAB has at most one negative eigenvalue ͑Sanpera et al., 1998͒. For general multipartite and higher local dimension this is only a sufﬁcient condition for the presence of entanglement.

There exist entangled states with a positive partial transpose known as bound entangled states ͑Horodecki et al., 1998; Acin et al., 2001͒.

E. Multipartite entanglement measures

Both the classiﬁcation of entanglement and its quantiﬁcation are at a preliminary stage even for distinguishable particles ͓see, however, Dür et al. ͑2000͒; Miyake and Wadati ͑2002͒; Verstraete et al. ͑2002͒; Briand et al. ͑2003, 2004͒, Luque and Thibon ͑2005͒; Osterloh and Siewert ͑2005, 2006͒; Mandilara et al. ͑2006͒, and references therein͔. We restrict ourselves to those approaches which have been applied so far for the study of condensed matter systems discussed in this review. It has already been mentioned that several quantities are useful as indicators for multipartite entanglement when the whole system is in a pure state. The entropy of entanglement is an example for such a quantity and several works use multipartite measures constructed from and related to it ͓see, e.g., Coffman et al. ͑2000͒; Meyer and Wallach ͑2002͒; Barnum et al. ͑2003͒; Scott ͑2004͒; de Oliveira, Rigolin, and de Oliveira ͑2006a͒; Love et al. ͑2006͔͒. These measures are of “collective” nature—in contrast to “selective” measures—in the sense that they give indication of a global correlation without discerning among the different entanglement classes encoded in the state of the system.
The geometric measure of entanglement quantiﬁes the entanglement of a pure state through the minimal distance of the state from the set of pure product states ͑Vedral et al., 1997; Wei and Goldbart, 2003͒

Eg͑⌿͒ = − log2 max͉͗⌿͉⌽͉͘2,

͑12͒

⌽

where the maximum is on all product states ⌽. As discussed in detail by Wei and Goldbart ͑2003͒, the previous deﬁnition is an entanglement monotone if the convex roof extension to mixed states is taken. It is zero for separable states and rises up to unity for, e.g., the maxi-
mally entangled n-particle GHZ states. The difﬁcult task in its evaluation is the maximization over all possible separable states and of course the convex roof extension to mixed states. Despite these complications, a clever use of the symmetries of the problem renders this task accessible by substantially reducing the number of parameters ͑see Sec. VIII͒.
Another example for the collective measures of multipartite entanglement as mentioned in the beginning of this section are the measures introduced by Meyer and Wallach ͑2002͒ and by Barnum et al. ͑2003, 2004͒. In the case of qubit system the Q measure of Meyer and Wallach is the average purity ͓which is the average onetangle in Coffman et al. ͑2000͔͒ of the state ͑Meyer and Wallach, 2002; Brennen, 2003; Barnum et al., 2004͒

523

The notion of generalized entanglement introduced by Barnum et al. ͑2003, 2004͒ relaxes the typically chosen partition into local subsystems in real space. The generalized entanglement measure used by Barnum et al. is the purity relative to a distinguished Lie algebra A of observables. For the state ͉␺͘ it is deﬁned as

PA = Tr͕͓PA͉␺͗͘␺͉͔2͖,

͑14͒

where PA is the projection map ␳ → PA͑␳͒. If the set of observables is deﬁned by the operator basis ͕A1 , A2 , . . . , AL͖ then PA = ͚iL=1͗Ai͘2 from which the reduction to Eq. ͑13͒ in the case of all local observables is evident. This conceptually corresponds to a redeﬁnition of locality as induced by the distinguished observable set, beyond the archetype of partition in the real space. It deﬁnes an observer dependent concept of entanglement adapted to, e.g., experimentally accessible or physically relevant observables. In this case, the generalized entanglement coincides with the global entanglement of Meyer and Wallach.
Another approach pursued is the generalization of the concurrence. For the quantiﬁcation of pairwise entanglement in higher dimensional local Hilbert spaces, the concept of concurrence vectors has been formulated ͑Audenaert et al., 2001; Badziag et al., 2002͒ besides the I-concurrence ͑Rungta et al., 2001͒. A concurrence vector was also proposed for multipartite systems of qubits ͑Akhtarshenas, 2005͒. It consists in applying the pure state concurrence formula to a mixed two-site reduced density matrix. It coincides with the true concurrence if and only if the eigenbasis of the density matrices provide optimal decompositions.
The n-tangle is a straightforward extension of the concurrence to multipartite states as the overlap of the state with its time reversed ͑Wong and Christensen, 2001͒. It vanishes identically for an odd number of qubits, but an entanglement monotone is obtained for an even number of qubits. It detects products of even-site entangled states in addition to certain genuine multipartite entangled states: it detects the multipartite GHZ or cat state, but not, for example, the four qubit cluster state.
Three classes of states inequivalent under SLOCC ͑stochastic LOCC͒ exist for four qubits ͑Osterloh and Siewert, 2005, 2006͒. Representatives are the GHZ state, the celebrated cluster state, and a third state, which is also measured by the 4-qubit hyperdeterminant. Class selective measures are constructed from two basic elements, namely the operator ␴y employed for the concurrence, and the operator ␴␮ · ␴␮ ª 1 · 1 − ␴x · ␴x − ␴z · ␴z where the dot is a tensor product indicating that the two operators are acting on different copies of the same qubit. Both are invariant under sl͑2 , C͒ operations on the qubit. The 3-tangle is then expressed as ␶3͓␺͔ = ͗␺ * ͉ · ͗␺ * ͉␴␮  ␴␯  ␴␭ · ␴␮  ␴␯  ␴␭͉␺͘ · ͉␺͘. The multilinearity, however, makes it problematic to employ the procedure of convex roof construction presented by Wootters ͑1998͒ and Uhlmann ͑2000͒ for general mixtures.

Finally we mention the approach pursued by Gühne et al. ͑2005͒ ͑see also Sharma and Sharma, 2006͒ where different bounds on the average energy of a given sys-
tem were obtained for different types of n-particle quantum correlated states. A violation of these bounds then implies the presence of multipartite entanglement in the system. The starting point of Gühne et al. is the notion
of n-separability and k-producibility which admit to dis-
criminate particular types of n-particle correlations present in the system. A pure state ͉␺͘ of a quantum system of N parties is said to be n-separable if it is possible to ﬁnd a partition of the system for which ͉␺͘ = ͉␾1͉͘␾2͘ ¯ ͉␾n͘. A pure state ͉␺͘ can be produced by k-party entanglement ͑i.e., it is k-producible͒ if we can write ͉␺͘ = ͉␾1͉͘␾2͘ ¯ ͉␾m͘, where ͉␾i͘ are states of maximally k parties; by deﬁnition m ജ N / k. It implies that it is sufﬁcient to generate speciﬁc k-party entanglement to construct the desired state. Both these indicators for multipartite entanglement are collective, since they are based on the factorizability of a given many particle
state into smaller parts. k-separability and
k-producibility both do not distinguish between different k-particle entanglement classes ͓as, e.g., the k-particle W-states and different k-particle graph states ͑Hein et al., 2004͒, like the GHZ state͔.

F. Indistinguishable particles

For indistinguishable particles the wave function is

͑anti͒symmetrized and therefore the deﬁnition of en-

tangled states as given in the previous section does not

apply. In particular, it does not make sense to consider

each individual particle as parts of the partition of the

system. Having agreed upon a deﬁnition of entangle-

ment, concepts as entanglement cost or distillation re-

main perfectly valid. Following Ghirardi et al. ͑2002͒ and

Ghirardi and Marinatto ͑2003͒ one can address the

problem of deﬁning entanglement in an ensemble of in-

distinguishable particles by seeing if one can attribute to

each of the subsystems a complete set of measurable

properties, e.g., momenta for free pointless particles.

Quantum states satisfying the above requirement repre-

sent the separable states for indistinguishable particles.

There is another crucial difference between the en-

tanglement of ͑indistinguishable͒ spin-1 / 2 particles and

that of qubits. We therefore consider two fermions on

two sites. Whereas the Hilbert space Hs of a two-site spin lattice has dimension dim Hs = 4, the Hilbert space Hf for two fermions on the same lattice has dimension dim Hf = 6. This is due to the possibility that both fermions, with opposite spins, can be located at the same

lattice site. When choosing the following numbering

of the states ͉1͘ = f1†͉0͘ ¬ cL† ,↑͉0͘, ͉2͘ = f2†͉0͘ ¬ cL† ,↓͉0͘, ͉3͘

tangled states, as ͉͑1 , 2͘ ± ͉3 , 4͒͘ / ͱ2, where both fermions

of four states labeled by the occupation number and the spin, if singly occupied. The site entanglement of indistinguishable particles is then deﬁned as the entanglement of the corresponding Fock states. It can be measured, e.g., by the local von Neumann entropy. This quantity is the analog to the one-tangle for qubits, but the local Hilbert space dimension is four due to the possibility of having empty and doubly occupied sites. Also the quantum mutual information ͑Groisman et al., 2005͒, see Eq. ͑9͒, can be deﬁned in this way, quantifying the total amount ͑classical and quantum͒ of correlations stored in a given state of a second quantized system.
Although from a mathematical point of view the entanglement of indistinguishable particles can be quantiﬁed, the major part of the literature on second quantized systems that we discuss in this review considers the site entanglement described above or the entanglement of degrees of freedom, singled out from a suitable set of local quantum numbers ͑e.g., the spin of the particle at site i͒. In both cases, entanglement measures for distinguishable particles ͑see Secs. IV.C.1 and V.F͒ can be used. With this respect, this section has a different scope than the others on the quantiﬁcation of entanglement; although most of the discussion which follows will not be used later on, we believe that it will be of interest for further studies of entanglement in itinerant many-body systems.

1. Two fermion entanglement

Due to the antisymmetry under particle exchange,

there is no Schmidt decomposition for fermions. Never-

theless, a fermionic analog to the Schmidt rank which

classiﬁes entanglement in bipartite systems of distin-

guishable particles does exist: the so-called Slater rank.

A generic state of two electrons on two lattice sites can

be written as ͉␻͘ ª ͚i4,j=1␻i,j͉i , j͘, where ␻ is a 4 ϫ 4 matrix which can be assumed antisymmetric and normalized as

tr

␻†␻

.

Since

the

local

entities

whose

entanglement

studied here are particles, unitary transformations act on

the four-dimensional single-particle Hilbert space. Due

to the indistinguishability of particles, the transforma-

tion must be the same for each particle. Given a unitary

transformation U ෈ SU͑4͒ such that fjЈ ª Ujkfk, the transformed state is given by ͉␻Ј͘, where ␻Ј ª U␻UT. The above unitary transformation preserves the antisymme-

try of ␻ and can transform every pure state of two

spin-1 / 2 particles on two sites into a state corresponding

to the normal form of ␻. In fact, every two-particle state

within a D-dimensional single-particle Hilbert space

can be transformed into the normal form ␻s = diag͕Z1 , . . . , Zr , Z0͖, where Zj = izj␴y and ͑Z0͒ij = 0 for i , j ෈ ͕1 , . . . , D − 2r͖. In the previous expression r is then

called the Slater rank of the pure fermion state ͑Schli-

emann, Cirac, et al., 2001; Schliemann, Loss, and Mac-

Donald, 2001; Eckert et al., 2002͒. A pure fermion state

is entangled if and only if its Slater rank is larger than 1.

It is important to note that the above concept of en-

tanglement only depends on the dimension of the Hil-

bert space accessible to each of the particles ͑this in-

cludes indistinguishable particles on a single D-level system͒.
For electrons on an L-site lattice the “local” Hilbert space dimension is 2L, and the question whether a pure state living in a 2L-dimensional single particle Hilbert space has full Slater rank can be answered by considering the Pfafﬁan of ␻ ͑Caianello and Fubini, 1952; Muir, 1960͒:

L

͑15͒

which is nonzero only if ␻ has full Slater rank L. In the above deﬁnition S2ϽL denotes those elements ␲ of the symmetric group S2L with ordered pairs, i.e., ␲͑2m − 1͒ Ͻ ␲͑2m͒ for all m ഛ L and ␲͑2k − 1͒ Ͻ ␲͑2m − 1͒ for k Ͻ m. Note that relaxing the restriction to S2ϽL leads to a combinatorial factor of 2LL! by virtue of the antisymme-
try of ␻ and hence can we write

͑16͒

where ␧j1,. . .,j2L is the fully antisymmetric tensor with ␧1,2,. . .,2L = 1. There is a simple relation between the Pfaff-
ian and the determinant of an antisymmetric evendimensional matrix: pf͓␻͔2 = det͓␻͔.

For the simplest case of two spin-1 / 2 fermions on two

Then,

͉␻˜ ͘ ¬ D͉␻͘ is the analog to the conjugated state in ͑Hill

and Wootters, 1997; Wootters, 1998; Uhlmann, 2000͒

leading to the concurrence for qubits. It is important to

note that the Pfafﬁan in Eq. ͑15͒ is invariant under the

complexiﬁcation of su͑2L͒, since it is the expectation

value of an antilinear operator, namely the conjugation

D for state ͉␻͘. Since this invariant is a bilinear expres-

sion in the state coefﬁcients, its convex roof is readily

obtained ͑Uhlmann, 2000͒ by means of the positive
eigenvalues ␭i2 of the 6 ϫ 6 matrix R = ͱ␳D␳Dͱ␳.
The conjugation D expressed in the basis

͕͉1,2͘,͉1,3͘,͉1,4͘,͉2,3͘,͉2,4͘,͉3,4͖͘ takes the form D0C, where C is the complex conjugation and the only nonzero ele-

ments of D are D16= D61= D34= D43= 1 and D25= D52= 1. Notice that the center part of this matrix is precisely

␴y  ␴y and indeed corresponds to the Hilbert space of two qubits. The remaining part of the Hilbert space

gives rise to an entanglement of different values for the

occupation number. This type of entanglement has been

referred to as the “ﬂuffy bunny” ͑Verstraete and Cirac,

2003; Wiseman et al., 2003͒, in the literature.

For a single-particle Hilbert space with dimension

larger than four one encounters similar complications as

for two distinguishable particles on a bipartite lattice and local Hilbert space dimension larger than two, i.e., for two qudits. This is because different classes of entanglement occur, which are characterized by different Slater rank as opposed to their classiﬁcation by different Schmidt rank for distinguishable particles. The Slater rank can be obtained by looking at Pfafﬁan minors ͑Muir, 1960͒: if the Slater rank is r, all Pfafﬁan minors of dimension larger than 2r are identically zero.
2. Multipartite entanglement for fermions
For indistinguishable particles the only classiﬁcation available up to now is to check whether or not a pure state has Slater rank one. Eckert et al. formulated two recursive lemmata ͑Eckert et al., 2002͒ that can be summarized as follows: Let an N-electron state be contracted with N − 2 arbitrary single electron states encoded in the vectors aj as akj fk†͉0͘ ͑j = 1 , . . . , N − 2 and sum convention͒ to a two-electron state. Then the Pfafﬁan of the two-electron state is zero if and only if the original state ͑and hence all intermediate states in a successive contraction͒ has Slater rank one. This means that all four-dimensional Pfafﬁan minors of ␻ are zero.
Instead of the Pfafﬁan of ␻, the single-particle reduced density matrix can also be considered, and its von Neumann entropy as a measure for the quantum entanglement has been analyzed by Li et al. ͑2001͒ and Paškauskas and You ͑2001͒. It is important to remember that for distinguishable particles the local reduced density matrix has rank one if and only if the original state were a product. This is no longer true for indistinguishable particles. For an N-particle pure state with Slater rank one the rank of the single-particle reduced density matrix coincides with the number of particles N. A subtlety is that a measure of entanglement is obtained after subtraction of the constant value of the von Neumann entropy of a disentangled state. This must be taken into account also for the extension of the measure to mixed states.

guishable particles must have one particle each in their

laboratory.

This difference induced by particle number superse-

lection is very subtle and shows up if multiple occupan-

cies occur at single sites for fermions with some inner

degrees of freedom, such as spin. Their contribution is

ﬁnite for ﬁnite discrete lattices and will generally scale to

zero in the thermodynamic limit with vanishing lattice

spacing. Therefore both concepts of spin entanglement

of two distant particles coincide in this limit. Signiﬁcant

differences are to be expected only for ﬁnite nondilute

systems. It must be noted that the same restrictions im-

posed by SSR which change considerably the concept of

entanglement quantitatively and qualitatively, on the

other hand, enable otherwise impossible protocols of

quantum information processing ͑Schuch et al., 2003,

2004͒ which are based on variances about the observable

ﬁxed by superselection.

where EM is some measure of entanglement for distinguishable particles. Although this certainly represents a deﬁnition of entanglement appealing for experimental issues, it is sensitive only to situations where, e.g., the two initially indistinguishable particles eventually are separated and can be examined one by one by Alice and Bob. Consequently, “local operations” have been deﬁned by Wiseman and Vaccaro ͑2003͒ as those performed by Alice and Bob in their laboratory after having measured the number of particles.3
Verstraete and Cirac pointed out that the presence of SSR gives rise to a new resource which has to be

3. Entanglement of particles
Entanglement in the presence of superselection rules ͑SSR͒ induced by particle conservation has been discussed by Bartlett and Wiseman ͑2003͒, Schuch et al. ͑2003, 2004͒, and Wiseman and Vaccaro ͑2003͒. The main difference in the concept of entanglement of particles ͑Wiseman and Vaccaro, 2003͒ from the entanglement of indistinguishable particles as described in the preceding section ͑but also to that obtained from the reduced density matrix of, e.g., spin degrees of freedom of indistinguishable particles͒ consists in the projection of the Hilbert space onto a subspace of ﬁxed particle numbers for either part of a bipartition of the system. The bipartition is typically chosen to be spacelike, as motivated from experimentalists or detectors sitting at distinct positions. For example, two experimentalists in order to detect the entanglement between two indistin-

3As a potential difference between the entanglement of photons as opposed to that of massive bosonic particles, it has been claimed that certain superselection rules may hold for massive particles only. One such claim is that we would in practice not be able to build coherent superpositions of states containing a different number of massive particles ͓for a recent discussion see Bartlett et al. ͑2007͔͒. This superselection rule would, for instance, prohibit creating a superposition of a hydrogen atom and molecule. However, the origin and validity of any superselection rule remains a debated subject. The arguments pro superselection rules usually involve some symmetry considerations, or some decoherence mechanism. On the other hand, it turns out that if we allow most general operations in quantum mechanics, we no longer encounter any superselection restrictions. Recent work ͑Dowling, Bartlett, et al., 2006; Terra Cunha et al., 2007͒ has shown that it should be possible to coherently superpose massive particles and to observe a violation of certain Bell inequalities ͑Terra Cunha et al., 2007͒ also for this case.

quantiﬁed. They have proposed to replace the quantity Ep with the SSR entanglement of formation. This is deﬁned as

where the minimization is performed over all those decomposition of the density matrix where the ͉␺͘n are eigenstates of the total number of particles ͑Schuch et al., 2003, 2004͒.
4. Entanglement for bosons
The quantiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of boson entanglement is very close in spirit to that of fermions as described in Sec. II.F.1. In the bosonic case the matrix ␻ introduced in the previous section is symmetric under permutations of the particle numbers. Consequently, for any two-particle state of indistinguishable bosons, ␻ can be diagonalized by means of unitary transformations of the single-particle basis. This leads to the Schmidt decomposition for bosons ͑Eckert et al., 2002͒. A curious feature distinguishing this case from the entanglement measures of distinguishable particles is that the Schmidt decomposition is not unique. In fact, any two equal Schmidt coefﬁcients admit for a unitary transformation of the two corresponding basis states, such that the superposition of the two doubly occupied states can be written as a symmetrized state of two orthogonal states ͑Li et al., 2001; Ghirardi and Marinatto, 2005͒. This is the reason why it is not directly the Schmidt rank, but rather the reduced Schmidt rank—obtained after having removed all double degeneracies of the Schmidt decomposition—that determines whether or not a state is entangled. This nonuniqueness of the Schmidt rank is also responsible for the ambiguity of the von Neumann entropy or other purity measures of the single-particle reduced density matrix as an entanglement measure for bosons ͑Ghirardi and Marinatto, 2005͒.
With zi the Schmidt coefﬁcients with degeneracy gi, the reduced Schmidt rank is at most gi / 2 + 2͕gi / 2͖, where ͕·͖ denotes the noninteger part. As a consequence, a Schmidt rank larger than 2 implies the presence of entanglement. A Schmidt rank 2 with degenerate Schmidt coefﬁcients can be written as a symmetrized product of orthogonal states and consequently is disentangled ͑Ghirardi and Marinatto, 2005͒. This feature is also present in the N-boson case, where in the presence of up to N-fold degenerate Schmidt coefﬁcients the corresponding state can be rewritten as a symmetrization of a product.
For bipartite systems ␻ has full Schmidt rank if det ␻ 0. A Schmidt rank 1 can be veriﬁed by the same contraction technique described for the fermion case in the previous section, where the Pfafﬁan must be replaced by the determinant. This applies to both the bipartite and the multipartite case ͑Eckert et al., 2002͒.

G. Entanglement in harmonic systems

In this section we concentrate on the entanglement between distinct modes of harmonic oscillators ͓see Braunstein and van Loock ͑2005͒; Adesso and Illuminati ͑2007͒ for recent reviews on the subject͔. The entanglement in this case is termed as continuous variable entanglement in the literature ͑to be distinguished from the entanglement of indistinguishable bosonic particles; see Sec. II.F͒.
Dealing with higher dimensional space of the local degrees of freedom generally involves complications which are not tamable within the current knowledge about entanglement. The Peres-Horodecki criterion, just to mention an important example, is not sufﬁcient already for two three-level systems, 3 ϫ 3. The situation simpliﬁes if only so-called Gaussian states of the harmonic oscillator modes are considered. This restriction makes the inﬁnite dimensional case even conceptually simpler than the ﬁnite dimensional counterparts. In order to explain what Gaussian states are, we introduce the Wigner distribution function W͑p , q͒ ͑Wigner, 1932͒. For a single degree of freedom it is deﬁned from the density operator ␳ as

͵ W͑r,

p͒

ª

1 ␲ប

ϱ
drЈ͗r + rЈ͉␳͉r − rЈ͘e͑2i/ប͒prЈ,
−ϱ

͑19͒

where r and p are conjugate position and momentum variables of the degree of freedom. The connection between bosonic operators aˆ , aˆ † and phase space operators
rˆ, pˆ is aˆ = ͑rˆ + ipˆ ͒ / ͱ2, aˆ † = ͑aˆ ͒† = ͑rˆ − ipˆ ͒ / ͱ2. More degrees
of freedom are taken into account in a straightforward manner. A ͑mixed͒ state ␳ is then called Gaussian when its Wigner distribution function is Gaussian. Examples for such states are coherent pure states ͉␣͘, aˆ ͉␣͘ = ␣͉␣͘ with ␣ ෈ C, and arbitrary mixtures of coherent states ␳ = ͐d2␣P͑␣͉͒␣͗͘␣͉, determined by the so-called P-distribution P͑z͒. Such states are termed classical if
the Wigner function and the P-distribution are nonnegative ͓see Simon ͑2000͔͒.
The key quality of Gaussian states is that they are completely classiﬁed by second moments, which are encoded in the symmetric so-called ͑co-͒variance matrix with the uncertainties of the phase space coordinates as entries. For two bosonic modes the phase space is four
dimensional and the covariance matrix V is deﬁned as

͵ V␣␤ ª ͕͗⌬␰ˆ␣,⌬␰ˆ␤͖͘ = d4␰⌬␰␣⌬␰␤W͕͑␰␥͖͒,

͑20͒

where the curly brackets on the left-hand side indicate
the anticommutator. The components of ␰ˆ␣, ␣ = 1 , . . . , 4 are ͑rˆ1 , pˆ 1 , rˆ2 , pˆ 2͒ and ⌬␰ˆ␣ ª ␰ˆ␣ − ͗␰ˆ␣͘; the average ͗·͘ is taken with respect to the given two-mode density matrix ␳, or, equivalently, using the Wigner distribution of ␳. Then, the canonical commutation relations assume the
compact form ͓␰ˆ␣ , ␰ˆ␤͔ = iប⍀␣,␤ with ⍀ = i␴y  1. When expressed in terms of V, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation can be invoked in invariant form with respect to

canonical transformations as det V ജ ប2 / 4 ͓see, e.g., Simon et al. ͑1994͔͒. The set of the real linear canonical transformation generates the symplectic group Sp͑2n , R͒ that plays an important role in the theory. Being a sym-

plectic matrix, V can be brought in its diagonal form Vn by means of symplectic transformations. The elements on the diagonal are then called the symplectic eigenvalues of V. An analysis of Vn⍀ has unveiled an even more powerful invariant form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, V + ͑iប / 2͒⍀ ജ 0, where the positive semideﬁniteness means that all symplectic eigenvalues are nonnegative. The uncertainty relation can hence be cast directly in terms of the symplectic eigenvalues of the

covariance matrix V, which are the absolute values of the eigenvalues of −i⍀V.
Some aspects of the harmonic systems can be disclosed by recognizing that the Gaussian structure of the bosonic states can be thought of as a certain limit of the algebraic structure of the qubits in the sense that Sp͑2 , R͒ Ӎ SL͑2 , C͒. The latter is the invariance group relevant for qubit entanglement classiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation ͑Dür et al., 2000; Verstraete et al., 2003; Osterloh and Siewert, 2005͒.
We now introduce the notion of bipartite entanglement for Gaussian states. In complete analogy to the ﬁnite-dimensional case, a state is termed separable if it is a mixture of product states. In particular, all classical states, i.e.,

͵␳ = d2z1d2z2P͑z1,z2͉͒z1͗͘z1͉  ͉z2͗͘z2͉,

͑21͒

with positive P͑z1 , z2͒ are separable. It was Simon ͑2000͒ that ﬁrst proved the Peres-
Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion being necessary and sufﬁcient for entanglement of two harmonic oscillator modes, again in complete analogy to a system of two qubits. The effect of transposition of the density matrix is a sign change in the momentum variables of the Wigner function ͑19͒. Consequently, a partial transposition induces a sign change of those momenta in the phase space vector, where the transposition should act
on. For an entangled state, the partial transposition V˜ of
its covariance matrix V might then have symplectic eigenvalues smaller than ប / 2. This can be detected by the logarithmic negativity as deﬁned from the symplectic
͑doubly degenerate͒ eigenvalues ͕c˜i ; i = 1 , . . . , n͖ of V˜ / ប ͑Vidal and Werner, 2002͒:

These important results paved the way towards a systematic analysis of multipartite systems of distinguishable bosonic modes.

III. MODEL SYSTEMS
This section is devoted to the basic properties of the model systems that will be analyzed in the rest of the

review ͑in several cases we concentrate on onedimensional systems͒.

A. Spin models
Interacting spin models ͑Auerbach, 1998; Schollwöck et al., 2004͒ provide a paradigm to describe a wide range of many-body systems. They account for the effective interactions in a variety of different physical contexts ranging from high energy to nuclear physics ͑Polyakov, 1977; Belitsky et al., 2004͒. In condensed matter beside describing the properties of magnetic compounds ͓see Matsumoto et al. ͑2004͒ for a recent survey͔, they capture several aspects of high-temperature superconductors, quantum Hall systems, and heavy fermions, just to mention few important examples. Hamiltonians for interacting spins can be realized artiﬁcially in Josephson junctions arrays ͑Fazio and van der Zant, 2001͒ or with neutral atoms loaded in optical lattices ͑Duan et al., 2003; Jané et al., 2003; Porras and Cirac, 2004͒. Interacting spins are paradigm systems for quantum information processing ͑Nielsen and Chuang, 2000͒.

In the previous expression i , j are lattice points, ͗·͘ con-
straints the sum over nearest neighbors, and Si␣ ͑␣ = x , y , z͒ are spin-1 / 2 operators. A positive ͑negative͒ ex-

change coupling J favors antiferromagnetic ͑ferromag-

netic͒ ordering in the x-y plane. The parameters ␥ and ⌬

account for the anisotropy in the exchange coupling in

the z direction, and hz is the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. There are only very few exact results concerning

H͑␥ , ⌬ , hz / J͒ in dimension d Ͼ 1. The ground state of Eq. ͑23͒ is in general entangled. It exists, however, for

any value of the coupling constants ␥ and ⌬, J Ͼ 0 a

point in d = 1 , 2 ͑for bipartite lattices͒ where the ground

state is factorized ͑Kurmann et al., 1982; Roscilde et al.,

2005b͒. It occurs
by hf = ͑z / 2͒Jͱ͑1

at the so-called factorizing ﬁeld hf given + ⌬͒2 − ͑␥ / 2͒2, where z is the coordina-

tion number.

In d = 1 the model is exactly solvable in several impor-

tant cases. In the following we discuss the anisotropic

quantum XY model ͑⌬ = 0 and 0 ഛ ␥ ഛ 1͒ and the XXZ

model ͑␥ = 0͒. Also the XYZ model in zero ﬁeld, ␥

0 , ⌬ 0 can be solved exactly but it will not be dis-

cussed here ͓see Takahashi ͑1999͒ for a review͔.

͑a͒ ⌬ = 0: Quantum XY model. The quantum Ising

model corresponds to ␥ = 1 while the ͑isotropic͒ XX

model is obtained for ␥ = 0. In the isotropic case the

model possesses an additional symmetry resulting in the

conservation of magnetization along the z axis. For any
value of the anisotropy the model can be solved exactly ͑Lieb et al., 1961; Pfeuty, 1970; Barouch and McCoy, 1971͒. By ﬁrst applying the Jordan-Wigner transformation ck = ei␲͚jk=−11␴j+␴j−␴k− ͓with ␴± = ͑1 / 2͒͑␴x ± i␴y͔͒ the XY model can be transformed onto a free fermion Hamil-

͑24͒

In the previous equation ci , ci† are the annihilation and creation operators for the spinless Jordan-Wigner fermi-
ons. The two matrices A, B are deﬁned as Aj,k = −J͑␦k,j+1 + ␦j,k+1͒ − hz␦j,k and Bj,k = −␥J͑␦k,j+1 − ␦j,k+1͒. For the case of periodic boundary conditions on the spins, an
extra boundary term appears in the fermionic Hamil-
tonian which depends on the parity of the total number
of fermions NF. Note that although NF does not commute with the Hamiltonian the parity of NF is conserved. A generic quadratic form, like Eq. ͑24͒, can be diagonalized in terms of the normal-mode spinless
Fermi operators by ﬁrst going to the Fourier space and
then performing a Bogoliubov transformation.
The properties of the Hamiltonian are governed by the dimensionless coupling constant ␭ = J / 2h. In the interval 0 Ͻ ␥ ഛ 1 the system undergoes a second order quantum phase transition at the critical value ␭c = 1. The order parameter is magnetization in the x direction, ͗Sx͘, which is different from zero for ␭ Ͼ 1. In the ordered phase the ground state has a twofold degereracy reﬂect-
ing a global phase ﬂip symmetry of the system. Magnetization along the z direction, ͗Sz͘ is different from zero for any value of ␭, but presents a singular behavior of its ﬁrst derivative at the transition. In the interval 0 Ͻ ␥ ഛ 1 the transition belongs to the Ising universality class. For ␥ = 0 the quantum phase transition is of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type.
As discussed in Secs. II.A and II.B one- and two-site-
entanglement measures can be related to various equaltime spin correlation functions ͑in some cases the block entropy can be reduced to the evaluation of twopoint correlators͒ Ml␣͑t͒ = ͗␺ ͉ Sl␣͑t͒ ͉ ␺͘ and gl␣m␤͑t͒ = ͗␺ ͉ Sl␣͑t͒Sm␤ ͑t͒ ͉ ␺͘. These correlators have been calculated for this class of models in the case of thermal equilibrium ͑Lieb et al., 1961; Pfeuty, 1970; Barouch and McCoy, 1971͒. These can be recast in the form of Pfafﬁans that for stationary states reduce to Toeplitz determinants ͑i.e., determinants, whose entries depend only on the difference of their row and column number͒. It can be demonstrated that the equal-time correlation functions can be expressed as a sum of Pfafﬁans ͑Amico and Osterloh, 2004͒.
͑b͒ ␥ = 0: XXZ model. The two isotropic points ⌬ = 1 and ⌬ = −1 describe the antiferromagnetic and ferromag-
netic chains, respectively. In one dimension the XXZ
Heisenberg model can be solved exactly by the Bethe ansatz technique ͑Bethe, 1931͒ ͓see, e.g., Takahashi

͑1999͔͒ and the correlation functions can be expressed in terms of certain determinants ͓see Bogoliubov et al. ͑1993͒ for a review͔. Correlation functions, especially for intermediate distances, are in general difﬁcult to evaluate, although important steps in this direction have been made ͑Kitanine et al., 1999; Göhmann and Korepin, 2000͒.
The zero temperature phase diagram of the XXZ model in zero magnetic ﬁeld shows a gapless phase in the interval −1 ഛ ⌬ Ͻ 1. Outside this interval the excitations are gapped. The two phases are separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition at ⌬ = 1 while at ⌬ = −1 the transition is ﬁrst order. In the presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld a ﬁnite energy gap appears in the spectrum. The universality class of the transition is not affected as a result of the conservation of the total spin-z component ͑Takahashi, 1999͒.
When one moves away from one dimension, exact results are rare. Nevertheless it is now established that the ground state of a two-dimensional antiferromagnet possesses Néel long range order ͑Manousakis, 1991; Dagotto, 1994͒.

2. Spin-1 Õ 2 models with inﬁnite range interaction
In this case each spin interacts with all other spins in the system with the same coupling strength H = −͑J / 2͚͒ij͓SixSjx + ␥SiySjy͔ − ͚ihi · Si. For site-independent magnetic ﬁeld hi␣ = h␣ ∀ i, this model was originally proposed by Lipkin, Meshkov, and Glick ͑LMG͒ ͑Lipkin et al., 1965; Meshkov, Glick, and Lipkin, 1965; Meshkov, Lipkin, and Glick, 1965͒ to describe a collective motion in nuclei. In this case the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of a collective spin S␣ = ͚jSj␣. The previous Hamiltonian reduces to

H = − J ͓͑Sx͒2 + ␥͑Sy͒2͔ − h · S.

͑25͒

2

Since the Hamiltonian commutes with the Casimir operator S2 the eigenstates can be labeled by the represen-
tation S of the collective spin algebra, at most linear in the number N of spins; this reduces ͑from 2N to N / 2͒ the
complexity of the problem. A further simpliﬁcation is
achieved at the supersymmetric point corresponding to J2␥ = 4hz, where the Hamiltonian can be factorized in two terms linear in the collective spin ͑Unanyan and Fleischhauer, 2003͒; then the ground state can be ob-
tained explicitly. For a ferromagnetic coupling ͑J Ͼ 0͒
and hx = hy = 0 the system undergoes a second order quantum phase transition at ␭c = 1, characterized by mean ﬁeld critical indices ͑Bottet et al., 1982͒. The average magnetization ͑for any ␥͒ mz = ͗Sz͘ / N saturates for ␭ ഛ ␭c while it is suppressed for ␭ Ͼ ␭c. For hy = 0, hz Ͻ 1, and ␥ = 0 the model exhibits a ﬁrst order transition at
hx = 0 ͑Vidal et al., 2006͒ while for an antiferromagnetic coupling and hy = 0 a ﬁrst order phase transition at hz = 0 occurs, where the magnetization saturates abruptly at the same value mz = 1 / 2 for any ␥’s.

529

The model Hamiltonian introduced at the beginning
of this section embraces an important class of interacting
fermion systems as well. By interpreting the nonhomo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld as a set of energy levels ͑hz͒i ϵ −⑀i, for hx = hy = 0 and ␥ = 1, it expresses the BCS model. This can be realized by noting that the operators Sj− ª cj↑cj↓ , Sj+ ª ͑Sj−͒†, Sjz ª ͑cj†↑cj↑ + cj†↓cj↓ − 1͒ / 2 span the su͑2͒ algebra in the representation 1 / 2. In the fermion language the Hamiltonian reads HBCS = ͚j,␴=͕↑,↓͖⑀jcj†␴cj␴ − ͑J / 2͚͒ijcj†↑cj†↓ci↓ci↑.
Both the LMG and BCS type models can be solved exactly by Bethe ansatz ͑Richardson, 1963; Richardson and Sherman, 1964͒ ͓see also Dukelsky et al. ͑2004͒ for a review͔ as they are quasiclassical descendants of the six vertex model ͑Amico et al., 2001; Di Lorenzo et al., 2002; Ortiz et al., 2005͒.

3. Frustrated spin-1 Õ 2 models
Frustration arises in systems where certain local constraints prevent the system from reaching a local energy minimum. The constraints can be of geometric nature ͑for example, the topology of the underlying lattice͒ or of dynamical nature ͑two terms in the Hamiltonian tending to favor incompatible conﬁgurations͒. A classical example of the ﬁrst type is that of an antiferromagnet in a triangular lattice with Ising interaction. At a quantum mechanical level this phenomenon can result in the appearance of ground state degeneracies. The equilibrium and dynamical properties of frustrated systems have been extensively studied in the literature ͑Diep, 2005͒ in both classical and quantum systems.
A prototype of frustrated models in one dimension is the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with nearestand next-nearest-neighbor interactions. This class of models was discussed originally to study the spin-Peierls transition ͑Schollwöck et al., 2004͒. The Hamiltonian reads

N

͚ H␣ = J ͑Si · Si+1 + ␣Si · Si+2͒.

͑26͒

i=1

Analytical calculations ͑Haldane, 1982͒ corroborated by numerical result ͑Okamoto and Nomura, 1992͒ indicate that at ␣ Ϸ 1 / 4 there is a quantum phase transition to a dimerized two-fold degenerate ground state, where singlets are arranged on doubled lattice constant distances. Such a phase is characterized by a ﬁnite gap in the low lying excitation spectrum.
The Majumdar-Ghosh model ͑Majumdar and Ghosh, 1969a, 1969b; Majumdar, 1970͒ is obtained from Eq. ͑26͒ for ␣ = 1 / 2. The exact ground state can be solved by means of matrix product states ͑see next section͒ and it is shown to be disordered. It is a doubly degenerate valence bond state made of nearest-neighbor spin singlets. Although all two-point correlation functions vanish, a ﬁnite four-spin correlation function does reﬂect an ordered dimerization.

FIG. 1. Schematic of the nearest-neighbor valence bond state, exact ground state of the spin-1 model in Eq. ͑27͒ for ␤ = 1 / 3 ͑AKLT-model͒. The ground state is constructed regarding every S = 1 in the lattice sites as made of a pair of S = 1 / 2, and projecting out the singlet state. The singlets are then formed taking pairs of S = 1 / 2 in nearest-neighbor sites.

4. Spin-1 models
Spin-1 systems were originally considered to study the quantum dynamics of magnetic solitons in antiferromagnets with single ion anisotropy ͑Mikeska, 1995͒. In one dimension, half-integer and integer spin chains have very different properties ͑Haldane, 1983a 1983b͒. Long range order which is established in the ground state of systems with half-integer spin ͑Lieb et al., 1961͒ may be washed out for integer spins. In this latter case, the system has a gap in the excitation spectrum. A paradigm model of interacting spin-1 systems is

͚ H = Si · Si+1 + ␤͑Si · Si+1͒2.

͑27͒

i=0

The resulting gapped phase arises because of the presence of zero as an eigenvalue of Siz; the corresponding eigenstates represent a spin excitation that can move
freely in the chain, ultimately disordering the ground state of the system ͑Gomez-Santos, 1991; Mikeska, 1995͒. The so-called string order parameter was pro-
posed to capture the resulting “ﬂoating” Néel order, made of alternating spins ͉↑͘, ͉↓͘ with strings of ͉0͘’s in between ͑den Nijs and Rommelse, 1989͒,

The ground state of physical systems described by Hamiltonians of the form of Eq. ͑27͒ has been studied in great detail ͑Schollwöck et al., 2004͒. Various phase transitions have been found between antiferromagnetic phases, Haldane phases, and a phase characterized by a large density of vanishing weights ͑Siz = 0͒ along the chain.
The Afﬂeck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model. Some features of the phenomenology leading to the destruction of the antiferromagnetic order can be put on a ﬁrm ground for ␤ = 1 / 3 ͑AKLT model͒, where the ground state of the Hamiltonian in Eq. ͑27͒ is known exactly ͑Afﬂeck et al., 1988͒. In this case it was proven that the ground state is constituted by a sea of nearestneighbor valence bond states, separated from the ﬁrst excitation by a ﬁnite gap with exponentially decaying correlation functions. Such a state is sketched in Fig. 1. In fact it is a matrix product state ͑MPS͒, i.e., it belongs to the class of states which can be expressed in the form

where the matrices ͑Aksi͒lm parametrize the state; ͉si͘ denotes a local basis of the D-dimensional Hilbert space;
the trace contracts the indices l , m labeling bond states of the auxiliary system ͑namely the spin-1 / 2 for the AKLT model͒. The dimensions of A depend on the particular state considered, if the state is only slightly en-
tangled then the dimension of A is bounded by some DMPS. MPS, ﬁrst discussed by Fannes et al. ͑1992͒, appear naturally in the density matrix renormalization group ͑DMRG͒ ͑Ostlund and Rommer, 1995͒. In onedimensional noncritical systems they describe faithfully the ground state. In fact, as shown by Vidal, matrix product states constitute an efﬁcient representation of slightly entangled states ͑Vidal, 2003͒.

If a nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion V͚␴,␴Ј,jnj␴nj+1␴Ј is taken into account in Eq. ͑30͒, a spin density wave and a charge density wave phase appear. A transition to a phase separation of high density and low density regions ͓see, e.g., Clay et al. ͑1999͔͒ is also present.
The bond charge extended Hubbard model, originally
proposed in the context of high Tc superconductivity ͑Hirsch, 1989͒, include further correlations in the hopping process already involved in Eq. ͑30͒. The Hamiltonian reads

͕ci,␴ , cj†,␴Ј͖ the on-site

The Hubbard model possesses a u͑1͒  su͑2͒ symme-

try expressing the charge conservation u͑1͒ = span͕N

= ͚j␴nj␴͖ and the invariance under spin rotation su͑2͒ = span͕Sz = ͚j͑nj↑ − nj↓͒ , S+ = ͚jcj†,↑cj,↓ , S− = ͑S+͒†͖. Such a symmetry allows one to employ the total charge and

magnetization as good quantum numbers. At half ﬁlling

n = N / L = 1 ͑␮ = U / 2͒ the symmetry is enlarged to so͑4͒

= su͑2͒  su͑2͒ by the generator ␩ = ͚j͑−͒jcj,↑cj,↓ together with its Hermitian conjugate ͑Yang and Zhang, 1990͒. It

was demonstrated that ͉⌿͘ = ͑␩͒N͉gs͘ are eigenstates of

the Hubbard model ͑in any dimension͒, characterized by

off-diagonal long-range order via the mechanism of the

so-called ␩ pairing ͑Yang, 1989͒.

In one dimension the Hubbard model undergoes a

Mott transition at U = 0 of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-

Thouless type. By means of the Bethe ansatz solution

͑Lieb and Wu, 1968͒ it can be demonstrated how bare

electrons decay in charge and spin excitations. The phe-

nomenon of spin-charge separation occurs at low ener-

gies away from half ﬁlling. For a repulsive interaction

the half-ﬁlled band is gapped in the charge sector; while

spin excitations remain gapless. The mirror-inverted

situation occurs for an attractive interaction where the

gap is in spin excitations instead ͑see Essler et al., 2004

for a recent review͒.

The Hubbard model in a magnetic ﬁeld was proven to

exhibit two quantum half ﬁlling for U Ͻ 0,

critical points while there is

at hca± = one at

4͉͑U ͉ ± 1͒ and
hcr = 4͑ͱt2 + U2

− U͒ for U Ͼ 0 ͑Yang et al., 2000͒.

͓for x = 0 the Eq. ͑31͒ coincides with the Hubbard model ͑30͔͒. For x 0 the hopping amplitudes are modulated by the occupancy of sites involved in the processes of tunneling. Because of the particle-hole symmetry, x can be restricted in ͓0,1͔, without loss of generality. For x = 1 the correlated hopping term commutes with the interaction. In this case the exact ground state was shown to exhibit a variety of quantum phase transitions between insulators and superconducting regimes, controlled by the Coulomb repulsion parameter U. For x = 1 the phase diagram is shown in Sec. IV, Fig. 15. At U / t = 4 and n = 1, a superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition occurs; for −4 ഛ U / t ഛ 4 the ground state is characterized by off-diagonal long-range order; the low lying excitations are gapless. For U / t = −4 a further quantum critical point projects the ground state into the Hilbert subspace spanned by singly and doubly occupied states ͑Arrachea and Aligia, 1994; Schadschneider, 1995͒. For intermediate x the model has not been solved exactly. Numerical calculations indicate a superconducting-insulator transition controlled by U and parametrized by x. Speciﬁcally, for 0 ഛ x ഛ 1 / 2 the phase is gapped at any nonvanishing U; for 1 / 2 Ͻ x ഛ 1 the onset to a superconducting phase was evidenced at some ﬁnite U ͑Anfossi, Degli Esposti Boschi, et al., 2006͒.
C. Spin-boson models
A prototype model in this class is that of a quantum system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators ͓see Weiss ͑1999͒ for a review of open quantum mechanical systems͔ known also as the Caldeira-Leggett model. In this case the quantum system is a two level system. This class of models was investigated to study the quantumto-classical transition and the corresponding loss of quantum coherence ͑Zurek, 2003͒.
The spin-boson Hamiltonian has the form

it can be demonstrated to be equivalent to the aniso-

tropic Kondo model ͑Anderson et al., 1970; Guinea,

1985͒. The coupling constants ͕␭n͖ ﬁx the spectral density of the bath: J͑␻͒ = ͑␲ / 2͚͒n␭n2␦͑␻ − ␻n͒ / ␻n. At low energy the spectral function can be represented as a power

law: J͑␻͒ ϰ 2␣␻s⌳01−s, where ␣ is the parameter controlling the spin-boson interaction and ⌳0 is a ultraviolet
cutoff frequency. The power s characterizes the bath.

For s = 1 the bath is called Ohmic, in this case the model

has a second order quantum phase transition at ␣ = 1

from underdamped to overdamped oscillations ͑where

the value of the spin is frozen͒. The value ␣ = 1 / 2 iden-

tiﬁes a crossover regime where the two-level system is

driven from coherent to incoherent oscillations. If the

bath is super-Ohmic ͑s Ͼ 1͒, the quantum critical point is

washed out, while a crossover occurs at ␣ ϳ log͑⌳0 / ␦͒. For sub-Ohmic baths ͑s Ͻ 1͒, several studies indicate

the existence of a quantum critical point ͑Spohn and

Dümcke, 1985͒. The question, however, is not com-

pletely settled ͑Kehrein and Mielke, 1996; Stauber and

Mielke, 2002; Bulla et al., 2003͒.

An interesting case is also that of a spin interacting

Such a model describes, for example, an atom interacting with a monochromatic electromagnetic ﬁeld ͑CohenTannoudji et al., 1992͒ via a dipole force ͑Jaynes and Cummings, 1963͒. Recently, the dynamics corresponding to Eq. ͑33͒ was studied in relation to ion traps ͑Cirac et al., 1992͒ and quantum computation ͑Hughes et al., 1998͒. The model deﬁned in Eq. ͑33͒ with S = 1 / 2 ͑Jaynes-Cummings model͒ was generalized and solved exactly to consider generic spin ͑Tavis and Cummings, 1969͒ in order to discuss the super-radiance phenom-
enon in cavity QED.

D. Harmonic lattices

The Hamiltonian for a lattice of coupled harmonic oscillators ͑harmonic lattice͒ can be expressed in terms of the phase space vector ␰ជT = ͑q1 , . . . , qn ; p1 , . . . , pn͒ as

where U is the n ϫ n interaction matrix for the coordinates. If the system is translational invariant the matrix U is a Toeplitz matrix with periodic boundaries, also called circulant matrix ͑Horn and Johnson, 1994͒. In the case of ﬁnite range interaction of the form

͚r͚kn=1Kr͑qk+r − qk͒2 and assuming periodic boundary conditions, its entries are Uj,j = 1 + 2͚r␣r and Uj,j+r = −␣r with ␣r = 2Kr / m␻2. Since the Hamiltonian ͑34͒ is quadratic in the canonical variables its dynamical algebra is

As discussed in Sec. II.G the key quantity that

characterizes the properties of harmonic systems is

the covariance matrix deﬁned in Eq. ͑20͒. For

the resulting decoupled harmonic oscillators it
is diag͕͑mͱ␩1␻͒−1 , . . . , ͑mͱ␩n␻͒−1 ; mͱ␩1␻ , . . . , mͱ␩n␻͖͒,
where ␩j are the eigenvalues of U. Employing the virial
theorem for harmonic oscillators, the covariance matrix

for a thermal state with inverse temperature ␤ = 1 / kBT can be calculated as well,

where N␤ = 1n + 2 / ͓exp͑␤␻ͱU͒ − 1n͔. The range of the po-
sition or momentum correlation functions is related to the low lying spectrum of the Hamiltonian. For gapped systems the correlations decay exponentially. The absence of a gap ͑some eigenvalues of U tend to zero for an inﬁnite system͒ leads to critical behavior of the system and characteristic long ranged correlations. A rigorous and detailed discussion of the relations between the gap in the energy spectrum and the properties of the correlations can be found in Cramer and Eisert ͑2006͒.

IV. PAIRWISE ENTANGLEMENT
At T = 0 many-body systems are most often described by complex ground state wave functions which contain all correlations that give rise to the various phases of matter ͑superconductivity, ferromagnetism, quantum Hall systems, etc͒. Traditionally many-body systems have been studied by looking, for example, at their response to external perturbations, various order parameters, and excitation spectrum. The ground state of many-body systems studied with methods developed in quantum information unveil new properties. In this section we classify the ground state properties of a manybody system according to its entanglement. We concentrate on spin systems. Spin variables constitute a good example of distinguishable objects, for which the problem of entanglement quantiﬁcation is most developed. We discuss various aspects starting from the pairwise entanglement, and proceed with the properties of block entropy and localizable entanglement. Most calculations are for one-dimensional systems where exact results are available. Section IV.B overviews the status in the d-dimensional case. Multipartite entanglement in the ground state will be discussed in Sec. VIII.

A. Pairwise entanglement in spin chains

1. Concurrence and magnetic order
The study of entanglement in interacting spin systems was initiated with the works on isotropic Heisenberg rings ͑Arnesen et al., 2001; Gunlycke et al., 2001; O’Connors and Wootters, 2001͒. O’Connors and Wootters aimed at ﬁnding the maximum pairwise entanglement that can be realized in a chain of N qubits with periodic boundary conditions. Starting from the assumption that the state maximizing the nearest-neighbor concurrence C͑1͒ was an eigenstate of the z component of the total spin ͑Ishizaka and Hiroshima, 2000; Munro et al., 2001; Verstraete et al., 2001͒ the problem was recast to an optimization procedure similar in spirit to the coordinate Bethe ansatz ͑Bethe, 1931͒:4 the search for the optimal state was restricted to those cases which excluded the possibility to ﬁnd two nearest-neighbor up spins. For ﬁxed number of spins N and p spins up, the state can be written as ͉␺͘ = ͚1ഛi1Ͻ¯ϽipഛNbi1¯ip͉i1 ¯ ip͘ ͑b are the coefﬁcients and ij are the positions of the upspins͒ therefore mapping the spin state onto a particle state such that the positions of the p particles correspond to those of the up spins. The maximum concurrence within this class of states can be related to the ground state gas of free spinless particles with the result

Equation ͑36͒ gives a lower bound for the maximal attainable concurrence. The isotropic antiferromagnetic chain was considered as the physical system closest to a perfectly dimerized system ͑classically, with alternating up and down spins͒. It was noticed, however, that the concurrence of the ground state of the antiferromagnetic chain is actually smaller than the value of the ferromagnetic chain, indicating that the situation is more complicated ͑O’Connors and Wootters, 2001͒. In order to clarify this point, a couple of simple examples are useful.
For a system of N = 2 spins the ground state is a singlet. However for general N ͑with an even number of sites͒ the ground state is not made of nearest-neighbor singlets ͓resonant valence bond ͑RVB͒ state͔. For example, the
N = 4 ground state is ͉gs͘ = ͑1 / ͱ6͓͒2͉0100͘ + 2͉1000͘
−͉1001͘ − ͉0110͘ − ͉0011͘ − ͉1100͔͘, different from the product of two singlets. It can be seen that the effect of the last two components of the state is to reduce the concurrence with respect to its maximum attainable value. Given the simple relation Eq. ͑36͒ between the nearest-neighbor concurrence and the ground state en-

4Such a method relies on the existence of a “noninteracting picture” where the wave function of the system can be written as a ﬁnite sum of plane waves; the ansatz is successful for a special form of the scattering among such noninteracting pictures.

ergy, the deviation from the RVB state can be quantiﬁed by looking at the difference from the exact ground state energy corresponding to the maximum concurrence. This maximum value is reached within the set of eigenstates with zero total magnetization ͓the “balanced” states in O’Connors and Wootters ͑2001͔͒, indicating that the concurrence is maximized only on the restricted
Hilbert space of z-rotationally invariant states. Indications on how to optimize the concurrence were discussed by Meyer et al. ͑2004͒ and Hiesmayr et al. ͑2006͒. The solution to the problem for N → ϱ was given by Poulsen et al. ͑2006͒. It turns out that the states with nearest-neighbor aligned spins ͓not included in O’Connors and Wootters ͑2001͔͒ correspond to a “density-density” interaction in the gas of the spinless particles considered above, that hence are important for the analysis. ͑in the analogy of the coordinate Bethe ansatz method, this provides the “interacting picture”͒. Following the ideas of Wolf et al. ͑2003͒, the problem to ﬁnd the optimum concurrence was shown to be equivalent to that of ﬁnding the ground state energy of an
effective spin Hamiltonian, namely, the XXZ model in an external magnetic ﬁeld. The optimal concurrence is found in the gapless regime of the spin model with a
magnetization Mz = 1 − 2p / N. It was further demonstrated that states considered by O’Connors and Wootters ͑2001͒ maximize the concurrence for Mz Ͼ 1 / 3 ͑for 0 ഛ Mz ഛ 1 / 3 the states contain nearest-neighbor up spins͒.
The concurrence, beyond nearest neighbors, in isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnets in an external magnetic ﬁeld was discussed by Arnesen et al. ͑2001͒; Wang ͑2002a͒; and Fubini et al. ͑2006͒. The combined effect of the magnetic ﬁeld and the anisotropy in Heisenberg magnets was studied by Jin and Korepin ͑2004a͒ making use of the exact results existing for the one-dimensional
XXZ model. It turns out that the concurrence increases with the anisotropy ⌬ ͑Kartsev and Karshnukov, 2004͒. For strong magnetic ﬁelds the entanglement vanishes ͑the order is ferromagnetic͒; for large values of the anisotropy ⌬ the state is a classical Neel state with Ising order. Except for these cases, quantum ﬂuctuations in the ground state lead to entangled ground states.
As discussed in Sec. III, in low-dimensional spin system there exists a particular choice of the coupling constants for which the ground state is factorized ͑Kurmann et al., 1982͒. This is a special point also from the perspective of investigating the entanglement in the ground state. Several works were devoted to the characterization of the entanglement close to the factorizing point. It turns out that the point at which the state of the system becomes separable marks an exchange of the parallel and antiparallel sector in the ground state concurrence, see Eq. ͑7͒. As this phenomenon involves a global ͑longrange͒ reorganization of the state of the system, the range of the concurrence diverges. ͑We notice that several deﬁnitions of characteristic lengths associated with entanglement decay exist.͒ The concurrence is often ob-
served to vanish when the two sites are farther than R

the concurrence. For the XY model it was found that this range is

The divergence of R suggests, as a consequence of the monogamy of the entanglement ͑Coffman et al., 2000; Osborne and Verstraete, 2006͒, that the role of pairwise

entanglement is enhanced while approaching the separable point ͑Roscilde et al., 2004, 2005a, 2005b͒. In fact, for the Ising model ͑i.e., ␥ = 1͒, one ﬁnds that the ratio

␶2 / ␶1 → 1 when the magnetic ﬁeld approaches the factor-

izing ﬁeld hf ͑Amico et al., 2006͒. For ␥ 1 and hf Ͻ hz

out in other one-dimensional systems for both short͑Amico et al., 2006; Roscilde et al., 2004, 2005a͒ and long-range interactions ͑Dusuel and Vidal, 2005͒. In all

these cases the range of the two-site entanglement di-

verges. The range of the concurrence was also studied

for the XXZ ͑Jin and Korepin, 2004a͒ where it was

shown to vary as

͑38͒

The exponent ␪ = 2 for ﬁnite ﬁelds, while it is ␪ = 1 for

h = 0; the coefﬁcient A͑h͒ is known exactly in the para-

magnetic phase ͑Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov, 1997;

Lukyanov, 1999; Lukyanov and Terras, 2003͒ ͑vanishing

magnetization͒ and in the saturation limit ͑Vaidya and

Tracy, 1979a, 1979b͒. For generic h it was calculated nu-

merically by Hikihara and Furusaki ͑2004͒. For the iso-

tropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet, R = 1 ͑Gu et al.,

2003͒.

In all previous cases the increase in the range of the

pairwise entanglement means that all pairs at distances

smaller than R share a ﬁnite amount of entanglement ͑as

quantiﬁed by the concurrence͒. There are one-

dimensional spin systems where the pairwise entangle-

ment has qualitative different features as a function of

the distance between sites. An example is the long-

distance entanglement observed by Campos Venuti, De-

gli Esposti Buschi, and Roncaglia ͑2006͒. Given a mea-

sure of entanglement E͑␳ij͒, Campos Venuti, Degli Esposti Buschi, and Roncaglia showed that it is possible

that E͑␳ij͒ 0 when ͉i − j͉ → ϱ in the ground state. Longdistance entanglement can be realized in various one-

dimensional models as in the dimerized frustrated

Heisenberg models or in the AKLT model. For these

two models the entanglement is highly nonuniform and

it is mainly concentrated in the end-to-end pair of the

chain.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking can inﬂuence the en-

tanglement in the ground state. To see this, it is conve-

nient to introduce the thermal ground state ␳0

which

is the T → 0 limit of the thermal state. In the previous expression gs+ and gs− are the symmetry broken states which give the correct order parameter of the model. They are superpositions of the degenerate parity eigenstates gso and gse. Being convex, the concurrence in gs± will be larger than in gso/e ͑Osterloh et al., 2006͒. The opposite is true for the concave entropy of entanglement ͓see Osborne and Nielsen ͑2002͒ for the single spin von Neumann entropy͔. The spontaneous parity symmetry breaking does not affect the concurrence in the ground state as long as it coincides with CI, Eq. ͑7͒: that is, if the spins are entangled in an antiferromagnetic way ͑Syljuåsen, 2003b͒. For the quantum Ising model, the concurrence coincides with CI for all values of the magnetic ﬁeld, and therefore the concurrence is unaffected by the symmetry breaking, the hallmark of the present quantum phase transition. For generic anisotropies ␥ instead, also the parallel entanglement CII is observed precisely for magnetic ﬁelds smaller than the factorizing ﬁeld ͑Osterloh et al., 2004͒; this interval excludes the critical point. This changes at ␥ = 0, where the concurrence indeed shows an inﬁnite range. Below the critical ﬁeld, the concurrence is enhanced by the parity symmetry breaking ͑Osterloh et al., 2006͒
2. Pairwise entanglement and quantum phase transitions
A great number of papers have been devoted to study entanglement close to quantum phase transition ͑QPTs͒. QPT occur at zero temperature. They are induced by the change of an external parameter or coupling constant ͑Sachdev, 1999͒. Examples are transitions occurring in quantum Hall systems, localization, and the superconductor-insulator transition in two-dimensional systems. Close to the quantum critical point the system is characterized by a diverging correlation length ␰ which is responsible for the singular behavior of different physical observables. The behavior of correlation functions, however, is not necessarily related to the behavior of quantum correlations present in the system. This behavior seems particularly interesting as quantum phase transitions are associated with drastic modiﬁcations of the ground state.
The critical properties in the entanglement we summarize below allow for a screening of the qualitative change of the system experiencing a quantum phase transition. In order to avoid possible confusion, it is worth noting that the study of entanglement close to quantum critical points does not provide new understanding to the scaling theory of quantum phase transitions. Rather it may be useful in a deeper characterization of the ground state wave function of the many-body system undergoing a phase transition. In this respect it is important to understand, for instance, how the entanglement depends on the order of the transition, or what is the role of the range of the interaction to establish the entanglement in the ground state. In this section we discuss exclusively the pairwise entanglement while in the

On increasing the system size, the minimum gets more pronounced and the position of the minimum tends ͑see the left-hand side inset͒ towards the critical point where for an inﬁnite system a logarithmic divergence is present. The right-hand side inset shows the behavior of the concurrence for the inﬁnite system. The maximum is not related to the critical properties of the Ising model. From Osterloh et al., 2002.

next section we approach the same problem by looking at the block entropy.5
Pairwise entanglement close to quantum phase transitions was originally analyzed by Osborne and Nielsen ͑2002͒, and Osterloh et al. ͑2002͒ for the Ising model in one dimension. Below we summarize their results in this speciﬁc case. The concurrence tends to zero for ␭ ӷ 1 and ␭ Ӷ 1, the ground state of the system is fully polarized along the x axes ͑z axes͒. Moreover, the concurrence is zero unless the two sites are at most nextnearest-neighbors, we therefore discuss only the nearest neighbor concurrence C͑1͒ ͑see, however, Sec. IV.A.1 for cases where there is a longer-range pairwise entanglement͒. The concurrence itself is a smooth function of the coupling with a maximum close to the critical point ͑see the right inset of Fig. 2͒; it was argued that the maximum in the pairwise entanglement does not occur at the quantum critical point because of the monogamy property ͑it is the global entanglement that should be maximal at the critical point͒. The critical properties of the ground state are captured by the derivatives of the concurrence as a function of ␭. The results for systems of different size ͑including the thermodynamic limit͒ are shown in Fig. 2. For the inﬁnite chain ‫␭ץ‬C͑1͒ diverges on approaching the critical value as

5QPTs were also studied by looking at quantum ﬁdelity ͑Cozzini et al., 2006; Zanardi et al., 2006͒ or the effect of single bit operations ͑Giampaolo, Illuminati, and Sienga, 2006; Giampaolo et al., 2008͒.

For a ﬁnite system the precursors of the critical behavior
can be analyzed by means of ﬁnite size scaling. In the
critical region the concurrence depends only on the combination N1/␯͑␭ − ␭m͒, where ␯ is the critical exponent governing the divergence of the correlation length and ␭m is the position of the minimum ͑see the left inset of Fig. 2͒. In the case of log divergence the scaling ansatz has to be adapted and takes the form ‫␭ץ‬C͑1͒͑N , ␭͒ − ‫␭ץ‬C͑1͒͑N , ␭0͒ ϳ Q͓N1/␯␦m␭͔ − Q͓N1/␯␦m␭0͔, where ␭0 is some noncritical value, ␦m͑␭͒ = ␭ − ␭m, and Q͑x͒ ϳ Q͑ϱ͒ln x ͑for large x͒. Similar results have been obtained for the XY universality class ͑Osterloh et al., 2002͒. Although the concurrence describes short-range properties, nevertheless scaling behavior typical of continuous phase transition emerges.
For this class of models the concurrence coincides with CI in Eq. ͑7͒ indicating that the spins can only be entangled in an antiparallel way ͑this is a peculiar case of ␥ = 1; for generic anisotropies the parallel entanglement is also observed͒. The analysis of the ﬁnite size scaling in the, so-called, period-2 and period-3 chains where the exchange coupling varies every second and third lattice sites, respectively, leads to the same scaling laws in the concurrence ͑Zhang and Burnett, 2005͒.
The concurrence was found to be discontinuous at the ﬁrst order ferromagnetic transition ⌬ = −1 in the XXZ chain ͑Gu et al., 2003͒ ͓see Glaser et al. ͑2003͒ for explicit formulas relating the concurrence and correlators for the XXZ model in various regimes͔. This result can be understood in terms of the sudden change of the wave function occurring because of the level crossing characterizing these types of quantum critical points. The behavior of the two-site entanglement at the continuous quantum critical point of the KosterlitzThouless type ⌬ = 1 separating the XY and the antiferromagnetic phases is more complex. In this case the nearest-neighbor concurrence ͑that is the only nonvanishing one͒ reaches a maximum as shown in Fig. 3. Further understanding of such behavior can be achieved by analyzing the symmetries of the model. At the antiferromagnetic point the ground state is an su͑2͒ singlet where nearest-neighbor spins tend to form singlets; away from ⌬ = 1, this behavior is “deformed” and the system has the tendency to reach a state of the type ͉␾qj ͘ made of q-deformed singlets corresponding to the quantum algebra suq͑2͒ with 2⌬ = q + q−1 ͑Pasquier and Saleur, 1990͒. This allows one to rephrase the existence of the maximum in the concurrence as the loss of entanglement as-
sociated to the q-deformed symmetry of the system away from ⌬ = 1 ͑note that q-singlets are less entangled than undeformed ones͒. This behavior can be traced back to the properties of the ﬁnite size spectrum ͑Gu et al., 2007͒. In fact, at ⌬ = 1 the concurrence can be related to the eigenenergies. The maximum arises since both the transverse and longitudinal orders are power law decay-

Studies of ﬁnite size energy spectrum of other models

the quantum phase transition ͑Gu et al., 2007͒.

͑a͒ LMG model. Because of the symmetry of the

LMG models ͓see Eq. ͑25͔͒ any two spins are entangled

in the same way. The concurrence C is independent on

the two site indices, it can be obtained by exploiting the

explicit expression of the eigenstates. Due to the mo-

nogamy of entanglement the result must be rescaled by

the coordination number, CR = ͑N − 1͒C to have a ﬁnite value in the thermodynamic limit. For the ferromagnetic

model ͑Vidal, Mosseri, and Dukelsky, 2004͒, it was

proven that close to the continuous QPT, ␭ = 1 character-

izing the ferromagnetic LMG model, the derivative of

the concurrence diverges, but, differently from Ising

case, with a power law. It is interesting that CR can be

Analysis of critical entanglement at the ﬁrst order quan-

shows that ͑Vidal, Mosseri, and Dukelsky, 2004͒ the dis-

continuity is observed directly in the concurrence for

͑b͒ Pairwise entanglement in spin-boson models. We

ﬁrst discuss the Tavis-Cummings model deﬁned in Eq. ͑33͒. In this model the spin S is proportional to the number of atoms, all interacting with a single mode radiation ﬁeld. The pairwise entanglement between two different atoms undergoing the super-radiant quantum phase transition ͑Lambert et al., 2004, 2005; Reslen et al., 2005͒ can be investigated through the rescaled concurrence
CN = NC, see Fig. 5, similar to what has been discussed above for the LMG models. In the thermodynamic limit the spin-boson model can be mapped onto a quadratic bosonic system through a Holstein-Primakoff transformation ͑Emary and Brandes, 2003͒. Many of the properties of the Tavis-Cummings model bear similarities with the ferromagnetic LMG model. In the thermodynamic limit the concurrence reaches a maximum value
1 − ͱ2 / 2 at the super-radiant quantum phase transition
with a square root singularity ͑see also Schneider and Milburn, 2002͒. The relationship between the squeezing of the state and entanglement was highlighted by Sø-

Entanglement between the qubits and a single mode and between two spins with a Heisenberg interaction of
the XXZ type, additionally coupled to a single bosonic ﬁeld, was considered by Liberti et al. ͑2006a, 2006b͒ and He et al. ͑2006͒, respectively.

3. Entanglement versus correlations in spin systems

From the results summarized above it is clear that the

anomalies characterizing the quantum critical points are

reﬂected in the two-site entanglement. At a qualitative

level this arises because of the formal relation between

the correlation functions and the entanglement. A way

to put this observation on a quantitative ground is pro-

vided by a generalized Hohenberg-Kohn theorem ͑Wu

et al., 2006͒. Accordingly, the ground state energy can be

considered as a unique function of the expectation val-

ues of certain observables. These, in turn, can be related

to ͑the various derivatives of͒ a given entanglement

measure ͑Wu et al., 2004; Campos Venuti, Degli Esposti

Boschi, et al., 2006͒.

Speciﬁcally, for a Hamiltonian of the form H = H0 + ͚l␭lAl, with control parameters ␭l associated with op-
erators Al, it can be shown that the ground state reduced operators of the system are well-behaved functions of

͗Al͘. Then, any entanglement measure related to re-
duced density operators M = M͑␳͒ is a function of ͗Al͘ ͑in absense of ground state degeneracy͒ by the

Hellmann-Feynman theorem: ‫ץ‬E / ‫␭ץ‬l = ͗‫ץ‬E / ‫␭ץ‬l͘ = ͗Al͘. Therefore it can be proven that

ͩ ͪ‫ץ‬E
M͑͗Al͒͘ = M ‫␭ץ‬l ,

͑40͒

where E is the ground state energy. From this relation
emerges how the critical behavior of the system is re-
ﬂected in the anomalies of the entanglement. In particu-
lar, ﬁrst order phase transitions are associated with the
anomalies of M while second order phase transitions
correspond to a singular behavior of the derivatives of
M. Other singularities, like those in the concurrence for models with three-spin interactions ͑Yang, 2005͒, are due to the nonanalyticity intrinsic in the deﬁnition of the
concurrence as a maximum of two analytic functions and
the constant zero. The relation given in Eq. ͑40͒ was constructed explic-
itly for the quantum Ising, XXZ, and LMG models ͑Wu et al., 2006͒. For the Ising model: ͚l␭Al = h͚lSlz; the divergence of the ﬁrst derivative of the concurrence is then determined by the nonanalytical behavior of ͗SxSx͘ ͑Wu et al., 2004͒. For the XXZ model: ͚l␭lAl = ⌬͚lSlzSlz+1. At the transition point ⌬ = 1 both the purity and the concurrence display a maximum. It was proven
that such a maximum is also reﬂected in a stationary point of the ground state energy as a function of ͗SizSiz+1͘; the concurrence is continuous since the Berezinskii-

Kosterlitz-Thouless transition is of inﬁnite order. A relevant caveat to Eq. ͑40͒ is constituted by the uniaxial LMG model in a transverse ﬁeld ͑with hy = 0 and ␥ = 0͒ that displays a ﬁrst order QPT for hx = 0. The concurrence is continuous at the transition since it does not depend on the discontinuous elements of the reduced density matrix ͑Vidal, Palacios, and Mosseri, 2004͒.
The relation between entanglement and criticality was also studied in the spin-1 XXZ with single ion anisotropy. It was established that the critical anomalies in the entropy experienced at the Haldane large D ͓if an axial anisotropy D͚i͑Siz͒2 is added to the Hamiltonian in Eq. ͑27͔͒ transition fans out from the singularity of the local order parameter ͗͑Sz͒2͘ ͑Campos Venuti, Degli Esposti Boschi, et al., 2006a͒.
A way to study the general relation between entanglement and critical phenomena was pursued by Haselgrove et al. ͑2004͒. It was argued how for systems with ﬁnite range interaction a vanishing energy gap in the thermodynamic limit is an essential condition for the ground state to have nonlocal quantum correlations between distant subsystems.
4. Spin models with defects
The problem of characterizing entanglement in chains with defects was addressed ﬁrst for the quantum XY models with a single defect in the exchange interaction term of the Hamiltonian ͑Osenda et al., 2003͒. It was found that the effect of the impurity is to pin the entanglement. Moreover, the defect can induce a pairwise entanglement on the homogeneous part of the system that was disentangled in the pure system. Even at the quantum critical point the ﬁnite size scaling of the critical anomaly of the concurrence is affected by the distance from the impurity. This basic phenomenology was observed in a variety of different situations that we review below.
The presence of two defects has been analyzed in the XXZ chain. It turns out ͑Santos, 2003͒ that various types of entangled states can be created in the chain by spin ﬂip excitations located at defect positions. The entanglement oscillates between defects with a period that depends on their distance. The anisotropy ⌬ of the chain is a relevant parameter controlling the entanglement between defects. Small anisotropies can suppress the entanglement ͑Santos and Rigolin, 2005͒. This kind of localization, which can be exploited for quantum algorithms, was studied by Santos et al. ͑2005͒. The entanglement was also studied in systems with defects in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld ͑Apollaro and Plastina, 2006͒. It was demonstrated that such a defect can lead to an entanglement localization within a typical length which coincides with the localization length.
A possible way to mimic a defect is to change the boundary conditions. The concurrence was studied for the ferromagnetic spin-1 / 2 XXZ chain with an antiparallel boundary magnetic ﬁeld which gives rise to a term in the Hamiltonian of the form Hboundary= h͑S1 − SN͒ ͑Alcaraz et al., 2004͒. The boundary ﬁeld triggers the pres-

ence of domain walls in the system that induces a ﬁrst order phase transition between ferromagnetic and kink-
type phases at hc = ͱ⌬2 − 1. In the ferromagnetic phase
the pairwise entanglement vanishes. In the kink-type phase the concurrence acquires a ﬁnite value ͑for h = 0 the ground state is factorized͒. For a ﬁnite chain of length L pairwise entanglement is generically triggered from the external magnetic ﬁeld, and it is enhanced at the center of the chain. In the gapless and antiferromagnetic regimes oscillation in nearest-neighbor entanglement is established in the system resulting from the tendency to reach the antiferromagnetic order. The oscillations are more pronounced in the gapped phase. Finally, a critical inﬂection point was noticed in the measure of Meyer and Wallach ͑2002͒ for the global entanglement at the transition point. The spin-1 / 2 XXX antiferromagnetic chain with open boundary conditions with single defect was studied by Wang ͑2004͒. It was proven that a threshold value exists for coupling between the impurity and the rest of the system at which the concurrence between them is switched on; for smaller values the entanglement is dimerized in such a way that the monogamy property prevents the impurity to be entangled with the rest of the chain.
The case of many defects was also studied. For the quantum Ising model it was found ͑Huang et al., 2004͒ that disorder can shift the point at which the concurrence is maximum, eventually washing out the critical behavior ͑strong disorder͒. The concurrence tends to be suppressed at the lattice site corresponding to the center of the Gaussian; such effect is more robust for near critical chains. Quantum XY and XXZ chains with Gaussian disorder in the exchange interaction have been also studied to investigate how the quantum criticality of the concurrence is robust by insertion of the inhomogeneities in the chain ͑Cai et al., 2006; Hoyos and Rigolin, 2006͒.
B. Two- and three-dimensional systems
In higher dimensions nearly all results were obtained by means of numerical simulations. The concurrence and localizable entanglement in two-dimensional quantum XY and XXZ models ͑Syljuåsen, 2003a͒ were considered. The calculations are based on quantum Monte Carlo ͑QMC͒ simulations and the use of stochastic series expansion for spin systems ͑Sandvik and Kurkij, 1991; Syljuåsen and Sandvik, 2002͒. Although the concurrence for the 2D models results to be qualitatively similar to the one-dimensional case, it is much smaller in magnitude. It is the monogamy that limits the entanglement shared among the number of neighbor sites ͑which is larger in two dimensions as compared with chains͒. Finally, it is observed that the maximum in the concurrence occurs at a position closer to the critical point than in the 1D case.
By studying appropriate bounds ͑concurrence of assistance and the largest singular value of the connected correlation functions͒, it was proven for the XXZ model

that the localizable entanglement is long ranged in the XY region up to the isotropic antiferromagnetic point. Similar to the case of the quantum XY chain, the bounds for the localizable entanglement are very tight in this case.
The pairwise entanglement in the d-dimensional XXZ model was studied by Gu et al. ͑2005͒. The concurrence reaches its highest value at the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ⌬ = −1. A spin-wave analysis corroborated by numerical exact diagonalization indicates that the concurrence develops a cusp in the thermodynamic limit, only for d ജ 2. Such behavior can be explained by noting that the level crossing between the ground and ﬁrst excited states occurring at the antiferromagnetic point causes a nonanalyticity in the ground state energy. The enhanced pairwise entanglement at the antiferromagnetic point together with its nonanalyticity support the conjectured existence of long-range order for twodimensional antiferromagnets. Further support to this conjecture is the strong size dependence of the von Neumann entropy that becomes singular in thermodynamic limit ͑Gu et al., 2006͒.
The ground state entanglement in the twodimensional XYZ model was analyzed by Roscilde et al. ͑2005b͒ with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The divergence of the derivative of the concurrence at the continuous phase transition, observed in d = 1, was conﬁrmed; in this case the range of the pairwise entanglement extends only to a few lattice sites. By studying the one and the two tangle of the system, it was proven that the QPT is characterized by a cusp minimum in the entanglement ratio ␶1 / ␶2. The cusp is ultimately due to the discontinuity of the derivative of ␶1. The minimum in the ratio ␶1 / ␶2 signals the enhanced role of the multipartite entanglement in the mechanism driving the phase transition. Moreover, by looking at the entanglement it was found that the ground state can be factorized at a certain value of the magnetic ﬁeld. The existence of the factorizing ﬁeld in d = 2 was proven for any 2D XYZ model in a bipartite lattice. Unexpectedly the relation implying the factorization is very similar to that one found in d = 1.
Multiple spin exchange is believed to play an important role in the physics of several bidimensional magnets ͑Schollwöck et al., 2004͒. Entanglement in the ground state of a two leg ladder with four spin ring exchange was evaluated by means of the concurrence ͑Song et al., 2006͒.
C. Pairwise entanglement in fermionic models
1. Noninteracting fermions
The site-based entanglement of spin degrees of freedom through the Jordan-Wigner transformation has been exploited for calculating the concurrence of nearest-neighbor sites and the single site von Neumann entropy ͑see Sec. II.F͒ for the one-dimensional tightbinding model in the presence of a chemical potential for spinless fermions by Zanardi ͑2002͒. This model is

Amico et al.: Entanglement in many-body systems

related to the isotropic XX model in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld. In this speciﬁc case, no double occupancy can occur and the concept of entanglement coincides with that for spin 1 / 2. It was found that the nearest-neighbor concurrence of the ground state at T = 0 assumes its maximum at the half-ﬁlled chain. Due to particle-hole symmetry, the concurrence results are symmetric with respect to half ﬁlling. At ﬁnite temperatures it was found that the threshold temperature for vanishing concurrence is independent of the chemical potential. Raising the chemical potential leads from a monotonically decreasing concurrence with raising temperature at low ﬁlling fraction to the formation of a maximum at a certain temperature for high ﬁlling fractions.
The continuous limit of the tight-binding fermion model is the ideal Fermi gas. In this system, the spin entanglement between two distant particles has been studied by Vedral ͑2003͒. There, depending on the dimensionality, the pairwise spin entanglement of two fermions was found to decrease with their distance for a ﬁnite range R of the concurrence. The two spin reduced density matrix is

where f͑x͒ = d͓J1͑x͒ / x͔ with d ෈ ͕2 , 3͖ the space dimension and J1 the ͑spherical for d = 3͒ Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind ͑Vedral, 2003; Oh and Kim, 2004͒. This density matrix is entangled for f2 ജ 1 / 2. As a consequence, there
is spin entanglement for two fermions closer than d0 Ϸ 0.65␲ / kf for d = 3 and d0 Ϸ 0.55␲ / kf for d = 2 ͑kf is the Fermi momentum͒. A ﬁnite temperature tends to diminish slightly the range of pairwise spin entanglement ͑Oh and Kim, 2004͒.
It should not be surprising that noninteracting par-
ticles are spin entangled up to some ﬁnite distance. It is
true that the ground state and even an arbitrary thermal
state of noninteracting fermions has vanishing entanglement among particles ͓which should not be confused with the nonvanishing entanglement of particles ͑Dowling, Doherty, and Wiseman, 2006͔͒, since the corresponding states are ͑convex combinations of͒ antisymmetrized product states. However, disentanglement in
momentum space typically leads to entanglement in co-
ordinate space. A monochromatic plane wave of a single
particle, for example, corresponds to a W state, which
contains exclusively pairwise entanglement in coordi-
nate space for an arbitrary distance of the sites. Further-
more, a momentum cutoff at kf corresponds to a length scale of the order kf−1.
It is interesting that fuzzy detection of particles in co-
ordinate space increases the entanglement detected by
the measurement apparatus. To this end, Cavalcanti et al. ͑2005͒ calculated the two-position reduced density matrix deﬁned by ␳s͑2sЈ͒,ttЈ = ͗⌿tЈ͑rЈ͒†⌿t͑r͒†⌿sЈ͑rЈ͒⌿s͑r͒͘ with blurred ﬁeld operators ⌿s͑r͒ ª ͐drЈdp␺s͑p͒D͑r

− rЈ͒eiprЈ, where D͑r − rЈ͒ = ͑1 / ͱ2␲␴͒exp͑−͉r − rЈ͉ / 2␴2͒ is a
Gaussian distribution describing the inaccuracy of the position measurement. This could be understood from the blurred ﬁeld operators being coherent sums of local ﬁeld operators; the entanglement measured by the apparatus as described above then is the bipartite entanglement between two regions of width ␴ around r and rЈ. This entanglement is larger than the average of all pairwise contributions out of it due to the superadditivity of the entropy or negativity. An analysis by Vedral ͑2004b͒ for the three fermion spin density matrix revealed that the state carries entanglement within the W class ͑Dür et al., 2000͒, provided the three particles are in a region with radius of the order of the inverse Fermi momentum; a similar reasoning applies to n fermions in such a region ͑Vedral, 2004b; Lunkes et al., 2005͒.
2. Pairing models
Itinerant systems, where the focus of interest is the entanglement of degrees of freedom forming a representation of su͑2͒ in terms of the fermionic operators, have been the subject of intense investigation. This line has been followed by Shi ͑2004͒ and Zanardi ͑2002͒ for analyzing a connection to BCS superconductivity and to the phenomenon of ␩ pairing, a possible scenario for high Tc superconductivity ͓see also Fan et al. ͑2004͒ and Vedral ͑2004a, 2004b͔͒. Such states appear as eigenstates of the Hubbard model with off-diagonal long-range order ͑see Sec. III.B͒. A simpliﬁed model of BCS-like pairing for spinless fermions has been studied by Zanardi ͑2002͒. The concurrence of the two qubits represented by the modes k and −k has been found to be a monotonically increasing function of the order parameter; it drops to zero signiﬁcantly before the critical temperature is reached. For electrons with spin, a connection between the BCS order parameter and the local von Neumann entropy in the particle number projected BCS ground state has been proposed by Shi ͑2004͒ ͓see also Gedik ͑2002͔͒.
States with off-diagonal long-range order by virtue of ␩ pairing are deﬁned in Sec. III.B. These are symmetric states and their concurrence vanishes in the thermodynamic limit due to the sharing property of pairwise entanglement of su͑2͒ degrees of freedom. Consequently, a connection to the order parameter of off-diagonal longrange order O␩ = ͗⌿͉␩j†␩k͉⌿͘ = N͑L − N͒ / L͑L − 1͒ → n͑1 − n͒ ͑with N , L → ϱ and ﬁxed ﬁlling fraction n͒ cannot be established, not even for the rescaled concurrence, since C → 1 / L ͑see also the analysis for the LMG model in Sec. IV.A.2͒. Nevertheless, the state is entangled, as can be seen from the entropy of entanglement and the geometric measure of entanglement ͑Wei and Goldbart, 2003͒. The latter is tightly connected to the relative entropy ͑Wei et al., 2004͒. Both have been calculated by Vedral ͑2004a͒ and indicate the presence of multipartite entanglement.

3. Kondo models

The Kondo models are paradigms to explore quantum

impurity problems. They identify a special class of physi-

cal systems whose macroscopic properties are dramati-

cally inﬂuenced by the presence of few impurities with

quantum internal degrees of freedom ͑Hewson, 1997͒. In

its simplest formulation, the effective Hamiltonian de-

scribes a single impurity spin interacting with a band of

free electrons. The many-body screening of the impurity

spin provided by electrons as a collective effect leads the

system from weak coupling to strong coupling regimes

͑Andrei, 1995͒; the length scale of the screening cloud is

␰K = v / TK, where v is the speed of the low lying excitations and TK is the Kondo temperature.
In the ﬁrst studies of the entanglement the charge de-

grees of freedom of electrons were considered frozen.

The pairwise entanglement of spin degrees of freedom

in the isotropic Kondo model was analyzed ͑Oh and

Kim, 2006͒ within the variational formalism of Yosida

where the Kondo singlet is described as
= ͑1 / ͱ2͉͒͑␾↓͉͘␹↑͘ − ͉␾↑͉͘␹↓͒͘, with ͉␹␴͘ the impurity

͉⌿s͘ spin

states and ͉␾␴͘ the electronic states with an unbalanced

spin ␴ ͑Hewson, 1997͒. It is commonly known that the

reduced density operator of the impurity is found to be

maximally mixed, meaning that the Fermi sea and the

impurity spin are in a maximally entangled state ͑the

Kondo singlet͒. The impurity spin and a single electron

are in a Werner state by superposition of the back-

ground and Kondo singlets. Due to the entanglement

monogamy ͑electrons cooperatively form a singlet with

spin͒ two electrons cannot be entangled with each other

within the Kondo cloud and the single-electron spin en-

tanglement vanishes in the thermodynamical limit. Pairs

of electronic spin can be nevertheless entangled in a ﬁ-

nite system through the scattering with the spin impu-

rity; this effect can be used to manipulate the electron-

electron entanglement by performing a projective

measure on the impurity spin ͑Yang et al., 2007͒. This

suggests that some amount of electron-electron en-

tanglement might be extracted even in the thermody-

namical limit where it was demonstrated that the Kondo

resonance is washed out by measurement ͑Katsnelson et

al., 2003͒—effectively removing the constraint of the en-

tanglement sharing.

The two impurity Kondo model was also studied. The

new feature here is the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida

͑RKKY͒ effective interaction between the impurity

spins S1 and S2 that competes with the Kondo mechanism ͑favoring nonmagnetic states͒; it is ferromagnetic

or antiferromagnetic depending on the distance between

the impurities. Because of such interplay a quantum

critical point emerges in the phase diagram separating

the spin-spin interaction regime from the phase where

the two spins are completely screened ͑Jones et al., 1988;

Afﬂeck and Ludwig, 1992͒.

As for the single impurity, the two impurity spins are

in a Werner state, for which the concurrence is charac-

terized by a single parameter ps, exhibiting a singlet type of entanglement between the two spin impurities. The

concurrence is found to vanish at the critical point. For a ferromagnetic RKKY interaction the concur-
rence between the impurity spin vanishes identically as
the result of a S = 1 Kondo screening. It turns out that ͑Cho and McKenzie, 2006͒ the impurity spins can be entangled ͑with a ﬁnite concurrence͒ by the RKKY interaction only when a certain amount of antiferromagnetic correlations fs = ͗S1S2͘ is established in the system; the value of the correlation function reached is at the quantum critical point. The entanglement between the conduction electrons and Kondo impurities is quantiﬁed by a combined analysis of the von Neumann entropies of the two impurities and single impurity ͑tracing out both electronic spins and the remaining impurity͒. The latter
quantity is maximized independent on fs, meaning that the impurity spin is completely screened either by the Kondo cloud or by the other impurity spin. In the regime where the Kondo mechanism dominates, the concurrence cannot be ﬁnite because of the entanglement sharing.
Entanglement in the Kondo physics of double quantum dots in an external magnetic ﬁeld was studied by Ramsak et al. ͑2006͒. The main phenomenology results to be consistent with the scenario depicted by Cho and McKenzie ͑2006͒ especially if the dots are arranged in series ͑each dot is coupled to the leads exclusively, resembling the conﬁguration of the Kondo spins embedded in electrons͒. The concurrence switches to ﬁnite values for a certain threshold of the interdot coupling ͑for which the assumptions of negligible charge ﬂuctuations results are still valid͒. The temperature weakens the entanglement between the qubits at T Ͼ TK. For the sideand parallel-coupled dots a more intense coupling among the qubits is required to entangle them. For the side-coupled dots this results because one has to win on the enhanced Kondo effect on the dot coupled to the leads ͑“two stage Kondo” effect͒; therefore the critical interdots coupling is ϳTK. For the parallel-coupled arrangement the concurrence is zero because the effective RKKY interaction turns out to be ferromagnetic up to a certain value that is the threshold to entangle electrons.
The RKKY interaction effectively controls the entanglement among the qubits in the case of many impurity spins arranged as in the Kondo necklace model ͑Saguia and Sarandy, 2003͒. The Hamiltonian describes a Kondo lattice where the localized impurity spins, displaced in every lattice site, interact with the ͑pseudo͒ spins of the electrons ͓see Tsunetsugu et al. ͑1997͒ for a review on Kondo lattice models͔. This results in the fact that additional on-site spin-spin interaction imposes a “selective” monogamy of the entanglement, depending on whether the Heisenberg interactions are ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. The effects of ﬁnite temperature and magnetic ﬁeld were also considered in anisotropic models. In these models a critical ﬁeld emerges that exists separating different patterns in the thermal entanglement between the eigenstates of the model.
Fluctuations of the charge degrees of freedom of electrons ͑frozen in the references cited above͒ in the RKKY mechanism was discussed quantifying the en-

tanglement of particles in a small cluster described by the periodic Anderson model ͑Samuelsson and Verdozzi, 2007͒. It was evidenced that the ground state of the system is characterized by a double occupancy of electronic levels, whose entanglement can be only partially captured by assuming them as simple qubits.
D. Entanglement in itinerant bosonic systems
In contrast to the free Fermi gas, in bosonic systems the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation ͑BEC͒ takes place at sufﬁciently low temperatures. Then, a macroscopic portion of bosons is found in the single particle ground state of the system. This state is a symmetrization of a product state in momentum space, and in fact all eigenstates of the ideal Bose gas are of that structure. Nevertheless, in principle entanglement could be present when going in the coordinate basis. It results, however, that this is not the case. Neither do two distant bosons carry spin entanglement ͑Vedral, 2003͒ nor are two distant groups of n and m particles entangled ͑Dowling, Doherty, and Wiseman, 2006͒ when superselection rules for the particle number are applied in both regions ͑Wiseman and Vaccaro, 2003͒. Simon ͑2002͒ employed a different notion of entanglement: the state of either part of a certain bipartition of the BEC has been viewed as a qudit, or, more precisely, an N-level system, where N is the number of bosons in the condensate and the different states in both regions are labeled by its occupation number. The entropy of entanglement for a spatial bipartition of the BEC is then nonzero. A proposal for entangling internal atomic degrees of freedom in a weakly interacting BEC has been put forward by Helmerson and You ͑2001͒; and Sørensen et al. ͑2001͒.
The disentangled modes in a BEC naturally become entangled by means of interactions or scattering between these modes. This has been exempliﬁed by Vedral ͑2003͒ ͓see also Shi ͑2004͔͒ for when the scattering strength is independent of the momentum transfer q : H = ͚q␧͑p͒ap†ap + V͚p,pЈ,qap†+qap†Ј−qapЈap. The Hamiltonian can be diagonalized for q = 0 and pЈ = −p by means of a Bogoliubov transformation ap ¬ upbp + vpb−†p. We observe that such transformation entangles the two modes ±p. The corresponding entropy of entanglement is ͑Vedral, 2003͒ Sp,−p = −͑vp / up͒2 ln ͑vp / up͒2 − ͓1 − ͑vp / up͒2͔ln͓1 − ͑vp / up͒2͔. If up = vp, the reduced state for mode p is maximally mixed, and hence the modes p and −p are maximally entangled. The entanglement entropy for a bipartition in positive and negative modes is then given by ͚pϾ0Sp,−p. This constitutes a simple example on how mode mixing generates entanglement. Such a scenario is rather generic; a curious example is the entanglement of the accelerated vacuum and from the viewpoint of relatively accelerated observers due to the Unruh effect ͓see, e.g., Alsing and Milburn ͑2003͒; Vedral ͑2003͒; Benatti and Floreanini ͑2004͒; FuentesSchuller and Mann ͑2005͔͒.
Further studies of entanglement in bosonic systems include the analysis in two-mode condensates ͑Hines et

al., 2002͒, in dipolar-couplar ͑Ng and Burnett, 2007͒, and in two-species spinor Bose condensates ͑Shi and Niu, 2006͒.
E. Entanglement of particles
Studies which use measures for indistinguishable particle entanglement ͑see Sec. II.F͒ in the area of manybody systems are still only few, particularly regarding the use of the fermionic concurrence, accounting for the possibility of double occupancy ͑with spin degrees of freedom͒. The entanglement of particles and its difference with the usual spin entanglement has been discussed by Dowling, Doherty, and Wiseman ͑2006͒, starting with very small systems as two spinless fermions on four lattice sites and the Hubbard dimer, and then for the tight binding model in one spatial dimension, in order to compare with existing results for the spin entanglement by Vedral ͑2003͒. For the Hubbard dimer ͑a two-site Hubbard model͒, these authors compare their results with those for the entanglement measured by the local von Neumann entropy without superselection rule for the local particle numbers ͑Zanardi, 2002͒. Whereas the latter signals decreasing entanglement in the ground state with increasing U / t, the entanglement of particles increases ͑Dowling, Doherty, and Wiseman, 2006͒. This demonstrates that imposing superselection rules may lead to qualitatively different behavior of the entanglement. Interestingly, an increase with U / t is also observed for the entanglement of modes without imposing superselection rules ͑Deng et al., 2005͒.
We ﬁnish this section by noting a recent proposal of an experiment in order to decide whether even entanglement merely due to the statistics of the indistinguishable particles can be useful for quantum information processing ͑Cavalcanti et al., 2006͒.
V. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY
An important class of works analyzing the entanglement in a many-body system considered a bipartition of the system dividing it into two distinct regions A and B as shown in Fig. 6. If the total system is in a pure state then a measure of the entanglement between A and B is given by the von Neumann entropy S associated with the reduced density matrix of one of the two blocks ͑␳A/B͒.
Motivated by the work of Fiola et al. ͑1994͒ and Holzhey, Larsen, and Wilczek ͑1994͒ born in the context of black hole physics, the problem was ﬁrst reanalyzed in the framework of quantum information by Vidal and co-workers for quantum spin chains ͑Vidal et al., 2003͒ and by Audenaert and co-workers for harmonic lattices ͑Audenaert et al., 2002͒.
In studying the properties of block entropy it is important to understand its dependence on the properties ͑topology, dimensions, etc.͒ of two regions A and B. A key property which is explored to understand its range of validity is known as the area law ͑Srednicki, 1993͒. When it holds the reduced entropy S would depend only

on the surface of separation between regions A and B. In a d-dimensional system this means Sl ϳ ᐉd−1, where ᐉ is the order of the size of one block ͓see Riera and Latorre ͑2006͒ for a discussion of the area law͔. In the rest of the section we discuss several different physical systems in one- and higher-dimensional lattices to see when the area law holds. Here we consider only manybody systems in their ground state, the thermal effect and the dynamical properties of the entropy will be discussed in Secs. VII and IX, respectively.
The entanglement entropy is not a mere theoretical concept but might be measured. Following the procedure proposed by Klich et al. ͑2006͒ the measure of S can be related to the distribution measurement of suitably chosen observables.
A. One-dimensional spin systems
We start our review on the properties of the block entropy by analyzing the case of one-dimensional spin systems to which a large body of work has been devoted. By means of the Jordan-Wigner transformation it is possible to map the models onto lattice fermions, hence the results discussed here are applicable to fermionic models ͑after the appropriate mapping͒ as well. A particularly important case which is amenable of an exact solution is the XY model ͑see Sec. III.A.1͒ which can be mapped onto a free fermion model. For this case we discuss in more detail the method to calculate the block entropy. In this section we consider only chains with short-range interaction.
1. Spin chains
In one dimension the surface separating the two regions is constituted by two points, therefore the area’s law would imply that the reduced entropy is independent of block size. This is indeed the case when the system is gapped and hence the correlation length ␰ is ﬁnite ͓see Hastings ͑2004͒ for a rigorous proof͔. In the gapless case, ␰ = ϱ, logarithmic corrections appear and the prefactor of the block entropy is universal, related to the central charge of the underlying conformal ﬁeld theory.

Holzey et al. ͑1994͒, beneﬁting from earlier work of Cardy and Peschel ͑1988͒, analyzed the block entropy of a ͑1 + 1͒-dimensional massless bosonic ﬁeld. Vidal et al. studied numerically one-dimensional Ising and Heisenberg chains ͑Vidal et al., 2003; Latorre et al., 2004͒ and conjectured that the block entropy would saturate for a noncritical chain while diverge logarithmically with a prefactor related to the central charge of the underlying conformal theory ͑Holzhey et al., 1994͒. Such violation of the area law in critical systems reﬂects how the mixedness of the state increases by the partial tracing operation, regardless of the spatial extension of the spin block.
Calculation of the block entropy by means of conformal ﬁeld theory, generalizing in several respects the results of Holzey et al. by including the case of free and periodic boundary conditions, different partitions, noncritical systems, and ﬁnite temperature, has been performed by Calabrese and Cardy ͑2004͒. Starting from the work on the XX model of Jin and Korepin ͑2004b͒, important explicit analytic calculations for a number of one-dimensional XY spin ͑free fermion͒ models have been carried out by Jin and Korepin ͑2004b͒; Korepin ͑2004͒; Peschel ͑2004, 2005͒; Eisler and Zimborás ͑2005͒; Its et al. ͑2005, 2007͒; Keating and Mezzadri ͑2005͒; Popkov and Salerno ͑2005͒; Franchini et al. ͑2006, 2007͒; Weston ͑2006͒. Numerical calculations on the XX and
XXZ models were also performed by De Chiara et al. ͑2005͒ and Laﬂorencie ͑2005͒. The study of entanglement entropy is of great interest in a more general context ͓see Fiola et al. ͑1994͒; Holzhey et al. ͑1994͒; Casini and Huerta ͑2005͒; Casini et al. ͑2005͒; Ryu and Takayanagi ͑2006a, 2006b͒ and references therein͔, Casini and co-workers, for example, evaluated the entanglement entropy for both massive scalar ﬁeld theory ͑Casini and Huerta, 2005͒ and Dirac ﬁelds ͑Casini et al., 2005͔͒. Recently the area law for gapped one-dimensional systems was proven by Hastings ͑2007a, 2007b͒.
The main features of the reduced entropy in onedimensional spin Fermi systems can be summarized as follows ͑for clarity we discuss only the long distance behavior as dictated by the underlying conformal ﬁeld theory͒.

where A is a constant and ␤ the inverse temperature. In the ﬁnite temperature case, however, the block entropy is not a measure of the entanglement between the two partitions as the state to start with is mixed. A comparison of numerical data with the CFT prediction is shown in Fig. 7 for the XXZ model. By now it is clear that the various measures of entanglement are sensitive to the presence of quantum phase transitions, the scaling of the entropy gives excellent signatures as well. Recent work tried to construct efﬁcient ways to detect quantum phase transitions by analyzing the reduced entropy for small clusters. Onesite entropy has been considered by Gu et al. ͑2004͒ and Chen et al. ͑2006͒. Chen et al. analyzed the entanglement of the ground states in XXZ and dimerized Heisenberg spin chains as well as in a two-leg spin ladder suggesting that the phase boundaries might be identiﬁed based on the local extreme of the entanglement entropy ͑Chen et

FIG. 8. The idea of the comb partition suggested by Keating Mezzadri, and Novaes illustrated for three different values of the spacing p. In all cases the subsystem A, denoted by solid circles contains l spins ͑be careful with the different notation with original paper͒ while the other ͑denoted by empty circles͒ contains the rest of the chain. The case p = 1 corresponds to the well-known “block” division. From Keating et al., 2006.
al., 2006͒. Legeza and co-workers ͑Legeza and Sólyom, 2006; Legeza et al., 2007͒ pointed out that in the biquadratic spin-1 Heisenberg chain, see Eq. ͑27͒, the two-site entropy is ideal to highlight the presence of a dimerized phase. They also considered the two-site entropy for the ionic Hubbard model ͑Hubbard and Torrance, 1981͒.
The idea of partitioning the system in a more elaborate way in order to analyze additional properties of entanglement lead to the introduction of the concept of comb entanglement ͑Keating et al., 2006͒. This is illustrated in Fig. 8. The two blocks A and B are not chosen contiguous but A consists of ᐉ equally spaced spins, such that the spacing between spins in this subsystem is p sites on the chain while B contains the remaining spins. For this choice of the partition, the “surface” separating the two blocks grows with the system size ͑different from the case p = 1 where it is composed by two links͒. As a consequence nonlocal properties of entanglement between the two blocks can be investigated. For p Ͼ 1 the leading contribution to the entropy scales linearly with block size Sᐉ͑p͒ = E1͑p͒ᐉ + E2͑p͒ln ᐉ. In the limit p → ϱ the coefﬁcient E1͑p͒ is, to leading order, a sum from single spin contributions. The unexpected result is that the corrections vanish slowly, as 1 / p, different from other measures like concurrence where these long-range corrections are not present.
We conclude this section by discussing the single copy entanglement E1 introduced by Eisert and Cramer ͑2005͒ and studied in detail for one-dimensional spin systems ͑Eisert and Cramer, 2005; Peschel and Zhao, 2005; Orus et al., 2006͒. Single copy entanglement Ssc,ᐉ quantiﬁes the amount of entanglement that can be distilled from a single specimen of a quantum system. For spin chains it can be shown ͑Eisert and Cramer, 2005͒ that single copy entanglement asymptotically is half of the entanglement entropy limL→ϱSsc,ᐉ / Sᐉ = 1 / 2. This result was later generalized to conformally invariant models ͑Peschel and Zhao, 2005; Orus et al., 2006͒.

2. XY chains and free fermion models

As shown in Sec. III.A.1.a the XY chain ͓⌬ = 0 in Eq. ͑23͔͒ can be mapped onto a model of free fermions. As a result an analytical ͑albeit nontrivial͒ approach is possible to calculate the block entropy. An analytic proof of the logarithmic dependence on the block entropy in the
isotropic XY model was obtained by Jin and Korepin ͑2004b͒; Its et al. ͑2005͒; Franchini et al. ͑2006, 2007͒. The relation between the entanglement entropy of this model and the corner transfer matrices of the triangular Ising lattice has been derived by Peschel ͑2004͒. Keating and Mezzadri considered a more general free fermion Hamiltonian in which the matrices A and B ͓deﬁned in Eq. ͑24͔͒ do not have the tridiagonal structure which appear in the XY model ͑Keating and Mezzadri, 2005͒. They showed that under certain conditions the entropy can be expressed in terms of averages over ensembles of random matrices. In this section we recall the main steps of the derivation leading to the evaluation of the entanglement entropy, more details can be found in Latorre, Rico, and Vidal ͑Latorre et al., 2004͒ and in the above-mentioned papers ͑Jin and Korepin, 2004b; Its et al., 2005; Keating and Mezzadri, 2005; Franchini et al., 2006, 2007͒.
The reduced density matrix of a block of ᐉ spins can be expressed in terms of averages of strings of ᐉ spin operators with weights given by the averages of these strings on the ground states. By mapping the spin
operators in terms of the Majorana fermions, a2l−1 = ͑⌸mϽl␴mz ͒␴lx, a2l = ͑⌸mϽl␴mz ͒␴ly, and given the fact that the resulting fermionic Hamiltonian is quadratic ͑Wick theorems holds͒, it is possible to express the block entropy in terms of the elements of the correlation

Numerical and analytical analysis of Eq. ͑47͒ has been performed leading to the behavior described in the pre-

ceding section. In order to obtain the analytical formula for the asymptotics of the entropy ͑47͒, the ﬁrst step is to recast it, by the Cauchy formula, into a contour integral ͑Jin and Korepin, 2004b; Its et al., 2005͒

can then be obtained from the asymptotics of DA͑␭͒. This in turn can be done resorting to the Riemann-
Hilbert approach to the theory of Fredholm integral equations ͑Bogoliubov et al., 1993͒. This allows one to
generalize the standard Szegö theorem for scalar
Toeplitz matrices to obtain the leading formula for the
determinant of the block Toeplitz matrix DA͑␭͒. This leads to the asymptotics, ᐉ → ϱ, for the entropy

The critical behavior of Eq. ͑49͒ can be obtained by the asymptotic properties of ␪3͑s , ␶͒ for small ␶, and the leading term of the critical entropy results S = −͑1 / 6͒log͓͉1 − ␭−1͉ / ͑4␥͒2͔ + O͓͉1 − ␭−1͉͑log͉1 − ␭−1͉͒2͔. The previous expression can be obtained in a more direct way via a duality relation connecting the
quantum Ising chain with the Ising model on a square or triangular lattice ͑Peschel et al., 1999; Calabrese and Cardy, 2004; Peschel, 2004͒. In particular the reduced density matrix can be written as the trace of the corresponding ͑corner͒ transfer matrix. In this way, however, the expression for the critical entropy can be obtained only for ␥2 + hz2 Ͼ 1.
In the isotropic case ␥ = 0, c = 1 and then the prefactor
of the log divergence is 1 / 3. In this case the critical en-
tropy can be obtained as an average, by realizing that the block Toeplitz matrices ͑for ␥ = 0͒ are unitary. Then the contour integral can be recast into an integral in the ensemble of unitary matrices. This observation ͑Keating and Mezzadri, 2005͒ allows are to relate the spectral statistics of the model with the entanglement encoded in
the ground state, following a reasoning that has many
analogies in spirit with random matrix theory. The en-
tanglement entropy was obtained explicitly for matrices B, in Eq. ͑24͒, being elements of classical groups. It is
interesting that only B effects the prefactor of the logarithm in entropy, which is proportional to 2wG, where wG is a universal quantity related to the classical group es-
tablishing the symmetries, and the constant of propor-
tionality is Hamiltonian dependent.

3. Disordered chains
Conformal invariance implies universal properties for the entanglement entropy. What happens when conformal invariance is lost as in the case of certain onedimensional disordered spin systems? Refael and Moore ͑2004͒ were the ﬁrst to look at this question by computing the block entropy for the Heisenberg, XX, and quantum Ising chains with random nearest-neighbor coupling. Their approach was based on a real space renormalization group developed earlier ͑Ma et al., 1979; Fisher, 1994͒ for random spin chains where disorder is relevant and drives the system at low energies in the so-called random singlet phase which can be thought of as a collection of singlet bonds of arbitrary length. Consequently, the entropy of a given chain segment is ln 2 times the number of singlets crossing the boundary between the two regions in which the systems is partitioned. Refael and Moore showed that the entropy, as in the case of clean critical chain, grows as the logarithm of block size Sᐉ ϳ c˜ log ᐉ with a renormalized central charge c˜ = c ln 2.
A numerical test of this prediction was performed both for the XX ͑Laﬂorencie, 2005͒ and for the Heisenberg models ͑De Chiara et al., 2005͒. In Fig. 9 we report the data of Laﬂorencie, the two curves represent the results for the clean and disordered case and fully conﬁrm the prediction of Refael and Moore. The result that the ratio between the random and pure prefactor values of the block entropy is the same for the different chains studied by Refael and Moore ͑2004͒ suggest that this value might be determined by ﬂow from the pure to the random ﬁxed point. This conjecture was questioned by analyzing the entanglement entropy for a family of models which includes the N-states random Potts chain and

4. Boundary effects

Boundaries or impurities may alter in a signiﬁcant

way the the entanglement entropy. The result given in

Eq. ͑42͒ was obtained for periodic boundary conditions.

If the block is at the boundary of the chain then the

prefactor is modiﬁed and the block entropy is one-half

of the one given in Eq. ͑42͒ ͑Calabrese and Cardy, 2004͒:

where A is the nonuniversal constant given in Eq. ͑42͒ and g is the boundary entropy ͑Afﬂeck and Ludwig, 1991͒. The case of open boundary conditions in critical XXZ chains was also reconsidered by Laﬂorencie et al. ͑2006͒. In addition to the log divergence there is a parity effect depending on the number of spins of the block being even or odd. The amplitude of the resulting oscillating term decays as a power law with the distance from the boundary. The origin of this oscillating term is easy to understand qualitatively as an alternation of strong and weak bonds along the chain. The boundary spin has a strong tendency to form a singlet pair with its nearest neighbor on the right-hand side; due to the monogamy of the entanglement this last spin will be consequently less entangled with its partner on the third site of the chain. Furthermore, it was also shown that the alternating contribution to the entanglement entropy is proportional to a similar term in the energy density ͑the constant of proportionality related to the lattice constant and velocity of excitations͒. The effect of open boundary conditions on the entanglement entropy of a resonant valence bond solid was studied as well ͑Fan et al., 2007͒. In this case, however, corrections due to open ends decay exponentially.
Different types of boundaries can appear in the AKLT quantum spin chain, with bulk spin 1 and two spin 1 / 2 at the ends. The entanglement entropy has been studied by Fan et al. ͑2004͒. They showed that the block entropy approaches a constant value exponentially fast with ᐉ.
The entanglement entropy of one-dimensional systems is affected by the presence of impurities in the bulk ͑Levine, 2004; Peschel, 2005; Zhao et al., 2006͒ or aperiodic couplings ͑Igloi et al., 2007͒. In these cases the entanglement entropy has the same form as in Eq. ͑42͒ but with an effective value which depends on the strength of the defect. The entanglement properties of anisotropic open spin-one-half Heisenberg chains with a modiﬁed central bond were considered by Zhao et al. ͑2006͒ where the entanglement entropy between the two half chains was calculated using the DMRG approach. They ﬁnd logarithmic behavior with an effective central charge varying with the length of the system. Numerical simulations of Zhao et al. ͑2006͒ showed that by going

545

from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic case the effective central charge grows from zero to one in agreement with Levine ͑2004͒. The combined presence of interaction between the excitation and a local impurity modiﬁes the properties of a one-dimensional system. Starting from the work of Kane and Fisher ͑1992͒ it is now understood that at low energies scattering with the impurity is enhanced or suppressed depending on the interaction being repulsive or attractive. It is therefore expected that the entanglement entropy is affected as well. Levine, by means of bosonization, studied the entanglement entropy in a Luttinger liquid interrupted by
an impurity and found that there is a correction to S due to the impurity which scales as ␦Simpϳ −VB log͑l / a͒, where VB is the renormalized backscattering constant ͑Levine, 2004͒. In the repulsive case the backscattering ﬂows to large values suggesting that the total entropy would vanish ͑the correction is negative͒. In the opposite case of attractive interactions, the impurity potential is shielded at large distances and the entropy would approach the value of the homogeneous liquid.
The single copy entanglement in the presence of boundaries has been considered as well ͑Zhou et al., 2006͒. Different from the bulk contribution here the boundary contribution to the von Neumann entropy equals that of the single copy entanglement.
Some of these results provided fertile ground to study the entanglement encoded in the Kondo cloud. Speciﬁ-
cally, the block entropy Simp of a spin cloud with radius r around the impurity with the rest of the system has been analyzed ͑Sørensen et al., 2007͒. By using a combination of Bethe ansatz results, conformal ﬁeld theory, and
DMRG methods, these authors demonstrated that Simp is a universal scaling function of r / ␰K.

B. Harmonic chains

Static systems of harmonic chains have been ﬁrst ana-

lyzed by Audenaert et al. ͑2002͒, where periodic ar-

rangements of harmonic oscillator modes have been

considered. The oscillators have been coupled via their

coordinate variables and the Hamiltonian has been cho-

sen to be translational invariant. The entanglement in

these systems has been analyzed for both the ground

state and thermal states; both belong to the class of

Gaussian states. Here we review the results obtained by

Audenaert et al. ͑2002͒. For work on higher-dimensional

lattices and emphasis on the entropy area law see Sec.

V.C.2.

Using the covariance matrix deﬁned in Eq. ͑35͒, the

logarithmic negativity can be expressed in terms of the

interaction matrix U ͑Audenaert et al., 2002͒ EN = tr log2 U−1/2PU1/2P, where P is a diagonal matrix, with

nonzero entries Pjj = −1 when the partial transposition is

performed and Pjj = 1 elsewhere. This entanglement monotone has been analyzed for bipartitions of a ring

containing an even number of oscillators. It is conve-

nient

teraction.

For

Remarkably, this result is independent of the ring size.

This also tells us that the negativity of the symmetric

bisection for a model including couplings ␣d of arbitrary range is higher than that of the corresponding chain with

only nearest-neighbor coupling and coupling strength

͚d␣d. It is interesting to note here that, for critical systems, the lowest eigenvalue of U tends to zero with

growing system size. This leads to a symplectic eigen-

value of V that diverges with the system size with a con-

sequent divergence of the negativity.

Analysis of general bisections revealed that for

nearest-neighbor couplings the negativity of a single os-

cillator with the rest of the chain monotonically de-

creases with the size of the chain. This single-oscillator

negativity turned out to establish a lower bound for the

negativity of any connected set of two or more oscilla-

tors with the rest of the same chain ͑see top panel of Fig.

10͒. In all cases the maximum negativity has been ob-

served for the symmetric bisection. Both features are

expected to be generic to coupled ensembles of har-

monic oscillators ͑Audenaert et al., 2002͒. In particular,

the inﬁnite size limit of the symmetric bipartition nega-

tivity establishes an upper bound: limm→ϱ EN͑m , m͒ ജ EN͑n1 , n2͒. This upper bound appears as a plateau in
the top panel of Fig. 10, which as a function of n1 and n2
is reached for not too small n1 and n2. The plateau value is essentially proportional to the average energy per os-

cillator. With increasing nearest-neighbor coupling

strength, a more shallow approaching of the plateau

value is observed ͑see bottom panel of Fig. 10͒.

The situation changes when the negativity of two dis-

connected parts of the chain is considered. The particu-

lar limiting case of an alternating bipartition, consisting

in all oscillators located at odd and even sites, has been

analyzed in the presence of nearest-neighbor couplings

only ͑Audenaert et al., 2002͒. In this setting the logarith-

mic negativity is no longer limited by the average energy

per oscillator but instead it grows linearly with system

size n. The conclusion is that one part of the negativity

can be related to the energy; the second part can be seen

as a surface term, proportional to the area of the bound-

ary forming the contact between both bipartitions. In

one spatial dimension this “area” is the number of con-

tacts between both parts, which in the periodic setting

described above equals n. This interpretation ﬁnds fur-

ther support in the result for the logarithmic negativity

of a symmetric bisection in an open chain of oscillators,

which is then roughly half the logarithmic negativity of

the corresponding chain with periodic closure ͓see dis-

cussion in Audenaert et al. ͑2002͔͒.

The value of the negativity is roughly half as large as for the periodic chain since the number of connection points of the parts is halved. In contrast to the periodic chain, the negativity of one small part with the rest of the open chain grows with system size From Audenaert et al., 2002.

An interesting puzzle results from analysis of the negativity of two connected chain parts that are separated from each other by a ﬁnite number of sites. Besides an expected all-over exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity with the distance between the two equally large groups, the negativity is also of limited range ͑see top panel of Fig. 11͒. This range increases with the size of the two parts. In particular, there is no pairwise negativity between two single oscillators unless they are neighbors. This implies that the entanglement of a distant group of oscillators cannot be due to “free” pairwise entanglement of single oscillators ͑as opposed to “bound” entanglement not detected by the negativity͒. So either “bound” pairwise entanglement is responsible for the entanglement present in distant groups or multipartite entanglement might play an important part.
We mention that pairwise correlations between single oscillators do exist notwithstanding a vanishing pairwise negativity ͑Audenaert et al., 2002͒. In any case the presence of correlations is necessary for quantum entanglement of the parts. It is worth noting that both the plateau exhibited by the negativity for not too small size of

the parts and the decrease of the single oscillators’ negativity with the system size ﬁnd a plausible explanation merely in terms of the correlation length. The same plausibility arguments predict the single oscillators’ negativity to increase with growing system size when open chains are considered; in fact this is what these authors observed ͓see Audenaert et al. ͑2002͔͒. The observed short range of the negativity in particular for small connected sets of oscillators overstretches this simple reasoning and demonstrates that the connection between entanglement and correlations is indeed more subtle.
C. Systems in d Ͼ 1 and the validity of the area law
The scaling of the entanglement entropy in systems of higher dimensions has been the subject of intense investigation in various ﬁelds of research. In the context of quantum information the understanding of the entropy scaling as a function of block size has important consequences on the simulability of a quantum system by a

classical algorithm and therefore is attracting a lot of interest. The picture that emerged from the analysis of the one-dimensional case, i.e., the violation of the area law when the system is critical, does not seem to hold in higher dimensions. The situation appears more complex. The higher dimensional generalization of matrix product states, the projected entangled pair states, satisfy the area law ͑Verstaete and Cirac, 2004; Verstaete et al., 2006͒ despite a divergent correlation length. Another example is the ground state of antiferromagnetic Isingspin networks embedded on planar cubic lattices ͑Wellard and Orus, 2004͒ where the area law is fulﬁlled at the critical point. In the following we concentrate on the ground state of some many-body Hamiltonian for which the block entropy has been recently computed. We ﬁrst consider the case of hopping Hamiltonian of ͑free͒ fermions and bosons and then discuss the case of harmonic lattices ͑note that historically the bosonic case was considered ﬁrst͒.

1. Fermi systems

In one dimension, by virtue of the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the block entropy of a system of interacting spins is tightly connected to that of a ͑free͒ Fermi gas. It is of great interest to understand what are the
properties of the block entropy for free fermions in d dimensions. This has been studied by Gioev and Klich ͑2006͒ and Wolf ͑2006͒ where it was shown that logarithmic corrections persist in higher dimensions,

Sᐉ ϳ ᐉd−1 log2 ᐉ.

͑52͒

The expression for the constant of proportionality in the equation above has been obtained by Gioev and Klich ͑2006͒ resorting to the Widom conjecture. Wolf ͑2006͒ exploited the quadratic lower bound of Fannes et al. ͑2003͒. The corrections to the area law are a Fermi surface effect. In the case of fractal dimension of either the Fermi or the block surface, the scaling is modiﬁed to Sᐉfr ϳ ᐉd−␤ log2 ᐉ, where 1 − ␤ is the maximum fractal enhancement of dimension of either the Fermi or the block boundary. An interesting case where the system undergoes a Lifhitz phase transition has been considered by Cramer et al. ͑2007͒. As it was pointed out by Cramer et al. these transitions related to a change in the Fermi surface manifest in nonanalytic behavior of the prefactor of the leading order term entanglement entropy.
For regular block and Fermi surfaces, numerical analysis has conﬁrmed the modiﬁed area law for critical two-dimensional ͑Barthel, Chung, and Schollwöck, 2006; Li et al., 2006͒ and three-dimensional ͑Li et al., 2006͒ models. Barthel, Chung, and Schollwöck ͑2006͒ studied the tight binding model as a two-dimensional model with a connected Fermi surface as well as the model H = −͚x,y͕͓1 + ͑−1͒y͔cx†,ycx,y+1 + cx†,ycx+1,y+1 + cx†,ycx−1,y+1͖ with a disconnected Fermi surface and H = −͚x,y͕hcx†,ycx+1,y + ͓1 + ͑−1͒x+y͔cx†,ycx,y+1͖ with a zerodimensional Fermi surface, for the one-dimensional case. Whereas in the ﬁrst two cases, the entropy is found to obey the modiﬁed area law, this is no longer true for

the third model with zero-dimensional Fermi surface. There corrections to the standard area law S ϳ ᐉd−1 are sublogarithmic.
The same feature has been observed by Li et al. ͑2006͒ studying the spinless fermionic in two and three spatial dimensions. These authors conjectured an interesting connection between the modiﬁed area law and the density of states at the Fermi energy. They formulated this in terms of the codimension at the Fermi energy: i.e., the dimension of momentum space minus the dimension of the degeneracy at the Fermi energy in momentum space, providing a measure of the relative portion of gapped excitations in the low lying spectrum of the model. In agreement with the ﬁndings for the model zerodimensional Fermi surface, these authors observed only sublogarithmic corrections to the area law if the codimension at the Fermi energy is 2. From this they conjectured that in two spatial dimensions a codimension less or equal to 1 is necessary for the modiﬁed area law S ϳ ᐉ log2 ᐉ to apply. They do not mention implications of fractal codimension due to a fractal Fermi or block surface. This ﬁnding would be worth further investigation to higher dimensions in order to ﬁx the connection between area law and codimension at the degeneracy point. We ﬁnally mention the interesting connection between the block entropy and the Berry phase in lattice models of fermions discussed by Ryu and Hatsugai ͑2006͒.
2. Harmonic systems
Harmonic systems have also been investigated to understand the validity of the area law. They provide one of the few physical systems for which exact analytical treatements are avaliable ͓see Cramer et al. ͑2006͒, and references therein͔.
We ﬁrst consider a system of noncritical harmonic oscillators with nearest-neighbor interaction and periodic boundary conditions. Noncriticality implies that the lowest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix U, ␭min͑U͒, is well separated from zero. Further peculiar characteristics of the covariance matrix, in particular its symmetric and circulant form, allow one to give estimates for upper and lower bounds of the block entropy of some compact d-dimensional hypercubic region with edge length ᐉ and surface proportional to ᐉd−1 ͑Plenio et al., 2005͒. The upper bound has been established directly from the logarithmic negativity ͓see Audenaert et al. ͑2002͔͒, whereas for the lower bound several estimates for the dominant eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix have been employed.
Key ingredients to the problem are the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and the uncertainty relation which constrains all eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to lie above ប / 2. The result is that both bounds are proportional to ᐉd−1, hence the entanglement entropy is proportional to the surface of the block. An extension to general block shapes has been formulated as well for Gaussian states ͑Cramer et al., 2006͒. For pure states, lower and upper bounds are given as before,

Amico et al.: Entanglement in many-body systems

which both scale linearly with the surface area of the block. For a given ﬁnite range of interaction beyond nearest neighbors, the area law can be stated only in terms of an upper bound ͓as in Plenio et al. ͑2005͒, this upper bound has been obtained from the logarithmic negativity͔. Therefore Cramer et al. ͑2006͒ could not exclude the block entropy to scale with lower dimensionality than the block area. The area law can even be present in disordered systems; the requirement for the area law to hold in this case is that ␬ ª ␭max͑U͒ / ␭min͑U͒ is bounded for all admissible disorder realizations. The
presence of a ﬁnite temperature T enters only in the proportionality factor, when thermal equilibrium states ͑which are still Gaussian͒ are considered.
It is interesting to note that an algebraically diverging correlation length does not automatically imply a violation of the area law. Cramer et al. ͑2006͒ found that for noncritical systems of harmonic oscillators and algebraic decay r−␣ of the correlations with distance r still leads to the area law as long as ␣ Ͼ 2d. Essential for this conclusion is that ␬ is bounded. These authors conjectured d as a tighter bound at least for hypercubic blocks ͑when compared to the one-dimensional Ising model, already at ␣ = d = 1 logarithmic corrections appear͒.
For critical systems the situation is different: criticality leads to eigenvalues of U arbitrarily close to zero and hence unbound ␬. Unanyan and Fleischhauer ͑2005͒ reported a one-to-one connection between criticality and logarithmic corrections to the area law for onedimensional systems with ﬁnite range interaction. These authors also reported evidence for this connection to hold in higher dimensional setups. However, the absence of logarithmic corrections for critical two-dimensional arrays of harmonic oscillators and nearest-neighbor interaction has been evidenced numerically in Barthel, Chung, and Schollwöck et al. ͑2006a͒. The analytical calculations of Cramer et al. ͑2007͒ concluded the area law to apply for arbitrary number of dimensions, opposed to the conclusions of Unanyan and Fleischhauer ͑2005͒. As support for their claim, Unanyan and Fleischhauer ͑2005͒ quoted a factoring interaction matrix, which, however, corresponds to a noninteracting array of onedimensional harmonic chains; this can be seen as the limiting case of an anisotropic interaction with ﬁnite range and does not give support to the original claim. It is indeed fundamentally different from harmonic
d-dimensional lattices with isotropic ﬁnite range interaction, as discussed by Barthel, Chung, and Schollwöck ͑2006͒ and Cramer et al. ͑2007͒. Nevertheless it raises the question for a critical anisotropy for the coupling of the harmonic oscillators, which on the background of the ﬁndings by Barthel, Chung, and Schollwöck et al. ͑2006͒ and Cramer et al. ͑2007͒ could be phrased as: “Does a ﬁnite critical anisotropy exist beyond which the harmonic lattice is quasi one-dimensional?”
Logarithmic corrections are also observed, when inﬁnite range interactions are considered, which drive the system towards criticality ͑Unanyan et al., 2007͒. To this end, these authors considered a two-dimensional array of harmonic oscillators, with an interaction of ﬁnite

range in the x direction and an inﬁnite range in the y direction. This is an instructive example in that it leads to the logarithmic correction ϳlx ln ly. Interestingly, the logarithm contains the length ly of the block, where the interaction has inﬁnite range. The prefactor of the logarithm is half the length of the block in the x direction ͑with ﬁnite range interaction͒.
D. LMG model
The logarithmic divergence with the block size of the entanglement entropy is not exclusive of onedimensional systems. The block entropy of the LMG model was studied in both the ferromagnetic ͑Stockton et al., 2003; Latorre, Orus, et al., 2005; Barthel, Dunsuel, and Vidal, 2006b; Vidal et al., 2007͒ and antiferromagnetic ͑Unanyan et al., 2005͒ cases. In the LMG model each spin is interacting with all other spins in the network; therefore, the idea of a block as depicted in Fig. 6 does not ﬁt very well. Nevertheless, it is perfectly legitimate to deﬁne the reduced entropy of ᐉ spins once the other N − ᐉ ͑N is the total number of spins͒ have been traced out. Evidently the entropy is independent on which spins have been selected to be part of the block. In Fig. 12 the representative behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of the various regions of the phase diagram is shown for a ﬁxed value of the block and system sizes. Below we summarize the main ﬁndings related to the LMG model. In the ferromagnetic case and in the case of ␥ = 1 ͑isotropic mode͒, the entropy diverges logarithmically with the block size S ϳ ͑1 / 2͒log ᐉ while at ﬁxed l and N diverges when the external magnetic ﬁeld approaches 1 from below. Also in the antiferromagnetic, case ͑Unanyan et al., 2005͒, when no transition as a function of the ﬁeld is present, the entropy grows logarithmically with the size of the block in the isotropic limit. Different from the onedimensional case where the prefactor is universal and related to the central charge, here the origin of the prefactor of the logarithmic divergence is related to the presence of the Golstone modes and to the number of vanishing gaps. Vidal et al. clariﬁed this issue by studying a number of collective spin models by means of 1 / N expansion and scaling analysis ͑Vidal et al., 2007͒.
E. Spin-boson systems
The entropy in models of spins interacting with harmonic oscillators have been analyzed as well. Here the separation between spin and bosonic degrees of freedom is natural and the partition leads to study the reduced entropy of one subsystem ͑say the spin͒. The entanglement entropy was studied for the Jaynes-Cummings ͑Bose et al., 2001͒, Tavis-Cummings model ͑Lambert et al., 2004, 2005͒, and for the spin-boson model ͑Costi and McKenzie, 2003; Jordan and Buttiker, 2004; Stauber and Guinea, 2006a; Kopp et al., 2007͒. Lambert and coworkers analyzed how the super-radiant quantum phase transition manifests in the entanglement between the

entropy is zero. In the symmetric phase the entropy can be easily expressed as a function of the ground state energy and ␦ ͓deﬁned in Eq. ͑32͔͒. At the transition point the entropy is discontinuous with a jump given by Kopp et al. ͑2007͒ as ⌬S = ln 2 + ␦ / 4␦c ln͑␦ / ␦c͒ ͑␦c is a high energy cutoff͒. A systematic analysis of the entropy in the spin-boson model for different coupling regimes was pursued recently by Kopp and Le Hur ͑2007͒ and Le Hur et al. ͑2007͒.
We ﬁnally mention the interesting connection between entanglement and energy ﬂuctuations introduced by Jordan and Buttiker ͑2004͒ and exploited in detail both for a spin and for harmonic oscillators coupled to a bath. This connection might be useful in light of possible experimental measure of entanglement ͓see also Klich et al. ͑2006͔͒. For example, as pointed by Jordan and Buttiker ͑2004͒, in certain mesoscopic realization of qubits as metallic rings of superconducting nanocircuits, a measurement of persistent current can be directly related to a measurement of the entropy.
F. Local entropy in Hubbard-type models
An important class of interacting fermion models is that of Hubbard type models ͑see Sec. III.B͒. First studies of entanglement in the one-dimensional case have appeared in Gu et al. ͑2004͒ and in Korepin ͑2004͒. Most of the studies in this type of systems analyzed the properties of the local entropy.
Gu et al. analyzed the local entropy for the onedimensional extended Hubbard model for fermions with spin 1 / 2. Due to the conservation of particle number and z projection of the spin, the local density matrix of the system takes the simple form

The contour plot below includes the known phase diagram of the model ͑full solid line͒. Except the superconducting phase, the phase diagram is nicely reproduced. Lower panel: The local entropy for the standard Hubbard model and different on-site couplings u as a function of the ﬁlling ͑1 corresponds to half ﬁlling͒.

account in this work. This does not affect the central result but might affect the entropy within the charge density wave phase. Except the superconducting phase, the phase diagram at half ﬁlling ͑for ␮ = 0͒ of this model has been nicely reproduced by the contour plot of the local entropy ͑see top panel of Fig. 14͒, where the phase transition coincides with its crest. This turns out to be a general feature of local entropies—also for spin models—as opposed to entanglement class speciﬁc measures, as, e.g., the concurrence for pairwise entanglement whose maxima in general appear at a certain distance to quantum critical points and hence are not associated to the quantum phase transition. In view of the monogamy of entanglement this is interpreted as evidence of dominant multipartite entanglement in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions.
For the Hubbard model Eq. ͑30͒ and ﬁxed U / t, the local entropy as a function of n shows a dip at the critical

ﬁlling fraction nc = 1, where a metal-insulator transition occurs ͑for U Ͼ 0͒ ͑see bottom panel of Fig. 14͒. For the two limiting cases U = 0 , ϱ the maximum instead is located at ﬁlling fractions, where the ground state is a singlet of the largest symmetry group. Gu et al. conjectured that this was true for general U Ͼ 0 and then the presence of an unknown phase transition at these maxima.
This analysis points out that the local entropy indicates different phase transitions in different ways, essentially depending on whether the quantity is sensitive to its order parameter or not. Due to the u͑1͒ symmetry of the model, the single site reduced density matrix is a function of occupation numbers only. These operators cannot, however, describe order parameters of superconductivity or some order parameter of the metalinsulator transition. Indeed, the superconducting phase can be predicted if the entropy of entanglement is calculated for a block of spins, instead of for just a single site ͑Deng et al., 2006͒. A reduced density matrix of at least two sites is necessary for superconducting correlations ͓see also Legeza and Sólyom ͑2006͒ for a similar result obtained for the ionic Hubbard model͔ to be seen.
Another model studied is the so-called bond-charge extended Hubbard model ͑see Sec. III.B͒. In phases II and III of Fig. 15 there are superconducting correlations which are due to ␩ pairing and hence indicate the presence of multipartite entanglement, as discussed before ͑Vedral, 2004a͒. At the bond-charge coupling corre-
sponding to x = 1, the entanglement of the model has been analyzed by Anfossi, Giorda, et al. ͑2005͒ and for
general x and n = 1 by Anfossi, Degli Esposti Boschi, et al. ͑2006͒ and Anfossi et al. ͑2007͒. Besides the local
entropy of entanglement Si, Anfossi, Giorda, et al. ͑2005͒ used the negativity ͑Vidal and Werner, 2002͒ and the quantum mutual information ͑Groisman et al., 2005͒. While Si measures all ͑pairwise and multipartite͒ quantum correlations involving this speciﬁc site, the negativity offers a lower bound for the quantum correlation of two speciﬁc sites, and mutual information accounts for pairwise quantum and classical correlations. Therefore this combination of correlation measures opens the possibility to decide what type of correlation is relevant at a quantum phase transition. The results are shown in the uper panel of Fig. 15. The different phases are shown in Fig. 15: they are discriminated by local occupation numbers as described in the top panel; consequently, the en-
tropy Si bears the information on all phase diagrams except the insulating line IV. This is seen from the plot of ‫ץ‬uSi ͑with u Џ U / t͒ as a function of the on-site Coulomb coupling u and the ﬁlling fraction n. A comparison of ﬁrst derivatives with respect to y = n , u ͑depending on the phase transition͒ of all three correlation measures reveals common singularities for ‫ץ‬ySi and ‫ץ‬yIij only for the transitions II-III and II-IV; furthermore, for both it
was proven that the range of the concurrence R diverges ͑Anfossi, Degli Esposti Boschi, et al., 2006͒. These facts allow one to characterize the transitions II-III and II-IV ͑at n = 1 and arbitrary x͒ as governed by pairwise en-

Empty, slashed, and solid circles indicate the presence of empty, singly, and doubly occupied sites, respectively.

tanglement, that is the more spread along the chain the closer the transition is gotten. For the transitions II-I and II-IЈ instead the multipartite entanglement is relevant, with a ﬁnite range of the concurrence. Similar behavior was encountered for noncritical spin models where the divergence of R is accompanied by the emergence of a fully factorized ground state ͑see Secs. III and IV.A.1͒. Here R diverges close to QPT; it was also noted by Anfossi et al. that, while the ground state in IV is indeed factorized, phase III is made of a superposition of doubly occupied and empty states. Observing that the

pairwise entanglement is vanishing in both phases III and IV, these authors conjectured that the divergence of R marks an “entanglement transition” solely in the pairwise entanglement.
In order to detect the transition II-IV at n = 1 and any x, ‫ץ‬xSi has been calculated by means of DMRG ͑Anfossi, Degli Esposti Boschi, et al., 2006͒. Its singularities allow one to accurately determine the charge gap as a function of the bond-charge coupling x.
We now proceed with the Hubbard model in a magnetic ﬁeld ͑see Sec. III.B͒ Also here, the local entropy Si has been looked at in order to analyze its entanglement. As in the examples before, Si indicates the second order phase transitions in terms of divergences of its derivatives ‫ץ‬hSi and ‫␮ץ‬Si, respectively. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that ‫ץ‬hSi and ‫␮ץ‬Si can be expressed in terms of spin and charge susceptibilities ͑Larsson and Johannesson, 2005͒, hence bridging explicitly the gap between the standard method in condensed matter physics for studying phase transitions and the approach from quantum information theory.
The local entropy for the bosonic version of the Hubbard model, the Bose-Hubbard model, was computed by Giorda and Zanardi ͑2004͒ and by Buonsante and Vezzani ͑2007͒ for different graph topologies. The focus of this work was on the dependence of the entanglement on the hopping amplitude. These authors showed that for certain classes of graphs the local entropy is a nonmonotonic function of the hopping. Also for the bosonic case the local entropy is a good indicator for the presence of a ͑superﬂuid-insulator͒ quantum phase transition.
Summarizing, the body of work developed suggests that local entropies can detect QPTs in systems of itinerant fermions, particularly if the transition itself is well predicted by a mean ﬁeld approach for local observables of the model ͓see also Larsson and Johannesson ͑2006͔͒. Furthermore, translational invariance is necessary for the prediction to be independent of the site, which the local entropy is calculated for. If this symmetry is absent, it might prove useful to average over the sites; the resulting measure is then equivalent to the Q measure ͑Meyer and Wallach, 2002͒.
G. Topological entanglement entropy
We close this section by summarizing the ongoing research studying subleading corrections to the block entropy in the two-dimensional systems. Most of the results were demonstrated for quantum two-dimensional lattices ͑though generalizations to higher dimension is straightforward͒.
Fradkin and Moore considered quantum critical points in two spatial dimensions with scale invariant ground state wave functions, characterizing, for example, the scaling limit of quantum eight vertex models and non-Abelian gauge theories ͓see Ardonne et al. ͑2004͔͒. The main result is that a universal logarithmically divergent correction, determined by the geometry

of the system’s partition, emerges in addition to the area’s law term in the entanglement block entropy ͑Fradkin and Moore, 2006͒.
Such work beneﬁts of the earlier seminal contribution of Kitaev and Preskill ͑2006͒ and Levin and Wen ͑2006͒ demonstrating that the correction to the area law is of topological origin. Namely, the entanglement entropy was demonstrated to scale as

S = ␣ᐉ − ␥ + O͑ᐉ−1͒.

͑54͒

The coefﬁcient ␣ is nonuniversal and ultraviolet divergent. In contrast, the quantity ␥ can be expressed as log D, where D is known as the total quantum dimension, it is universal, and related to the topological winding number of the theory. Calculations were pursued with methods of topological ﬁeld theory, giving an explicit expression for ␥.
We remark that the result of Kitaev and Preskill and Levin and Wen provides an alternative avenue to lattice gauge theory methods ͑Wen, 2004͒, detecting a genuine topological order in the system ͑when descriptions based on local order parameters fail͒ by direct inspection of the wave function.
When a topological order is present, the ground state of the system acquires a peculiar degeneracy when its
lattice has a nontrivial genus g. Hamma et al. studied the entropy of the Kitaev model on a two-dimensional lattice with generic genus g. The Kitaev model ͑Kitaev, 2003͒ is a two-dimensional exactly solvable lattice model with double periodic boundary conditions, whose Hamiltonian can be realized with a set of spins in a square lattice with ring exchange and vertex interactions. The ground state of the Kitaev model is characterized by the presence of a topological order.6 For such systems Hamma et al. related the degeneracy of the ground state ͑that is, 4g͒ to the block entropy ͑Hamma et al., 2005a, 2005b͒.
As a step toward models with more generic topological orders, the topological entropy was studied numerically for the quantum dimer model in a triangular lattice ͑Furukawa and Misguich, 2007͒ and for fractional quantum Hall states ͑Haque et al., 2007͒. We ﬁnally mention that the topological term in the entanglement entropy in the context of quantum gravity was evidenced by Fursaev ͑2006͒ and Ryu and Takayanagi ͑2006b͒.

H. Entanglement along renormalization group ﬂow
One of the original motivations put forward by Preskill to investigate entanglement in many-body systems ͑Preskill, 2000͒ was the idea that quantum information could elucidate some features of the renormalization group which is a cornerstone method in modern physics. It is natural to think that the procedure of trac-

ing out high energy modes in a renormalization group step has some kind of irreversibility built in. Quantum information concepts could prove to be useful in elucidating issues related to this irreversibility and possible help could come from relating the celebrated c theorem ͑Zamolodchikov, 1986͒ to the loss of information.
Entanglement loss along a renormalization group trajectory was studied in spin chains ͑Latorre, Lütken, et al., 2005͒. Recently a number of relations relating renormalization group, conformal ﬁeld invariance, and entanglement loss were derived by Orus ͑2005͒. According to Latorre, Lütken, et al. ͑2005͒ entanglement loss can be characterized at three different levels.
͑1͒ Global entanglement loss. By using the block entropy as a measure of entanglement, for which we know the result of Eq. ͑42͒, and an inequality on the central charges which derives from the c theorem, it follows that SUVജ SIR. The block entropy at the ultraviolet ﬁxed point cannot be smaller than that at the infrared ﬁxed point.
͑2͒ Monotonous entanglement loss. It is also possible to follow the entanglement along the entire transformation. In this case the entropy is a nondecreasing function along the ﬂow. As a simple example one can consider the block entropy of an Ising chain close to the critical point which goes as S ϳ ln͉␭ − 1͉, from which monotonicity follows.
͑3͒ Fine-grained entanglement loss. The monotonicity of the entanglement appears present at a deeper level in the structure of the density matrix. One can show ͑Latorre, Lütken, et al., 2005; Orus et al., 2006͒ through majorization relations that the spectrum of the reduced density matrix gets more ordered along the ﬂow. By denoting rm the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix ␳, majorization relation between the two sets of spectra ͑corresponding to two different parameters͒ means that there is a set of relations for which ͚i=1,nri ജ ͚i=1,nriЈ for n = 1 , . . . , d ͑d is the dimension of ␳͒.
Motivated by ultraviolet divergencies of the entropy of entanglement in quantum ﬁeld theory, Casini and Huerta introduced a quantity F͑A , B͒ related to the entropy measuring the degree of entanglement between two regions A and B. The function F is deﬁned as F͑A , B͒ = S͑A͒ + S͑B͒ − S͑A പ B͒ − S͑A ഫ B͒ which coincides with the mutual information Eq. ͑9͒ in the case of nonintersecting regions. In two dimensions, it is a ﬁnite positive function with the property F͑A , B͒ ഛ F͑A , C͒ for B ʚ C if A പ C = . Then, for sets with a single ͑pathconnected͒ component in two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories they showed that it allows one to prove an alternative entropic version of the c theorem ͑Casini and Huerta, 2007͒.
VI. LOCALIZABLE ENTANGLEMENT
A. Localizable entanglement and quantum criticality
The study of localizable entanglement ͑see Sec. II.C͒ in spin chains allows one to ﬁnd a tighter connection

between the scales over which entanglement and correlations decay ͑as shown previously the two spin entanglement, expressed by the concurrence, does not decay on the same range of correlations͒ ͑Verstraete, Martin-Delgado, and Cirac, 2004; Popp et al., 2005, 2006͒. One expects that the procedure of entangling distant sites by a set of local measurements will be less
effective as the distance the two particles increases thus leading to a deﬁnition of entanglement length ␰E. For a translational invariant system ␰E can be deﬁned in analogy of the standard correlation length:

͑55͒

By deﬁnition the entanglement length cannot be smaller than the correlation length ␰E ജ ␰, therefore at a second order phase transition the localizable entanglement length diverges. In addition, there may also appear “transition points” associated solely to a divergence in ␰E. In order to avoid misinterpretations, it must be stressed that the localizable “classical” two-point correlations then diverge as well. Thus the essence of the phenomenon is that correlations can be localized between arbitrarily distant sites by means of suitable local operations and classical communication despite a ﬁnite correlation length; necessary for this is the presence of global entanglement ͑Popescu and Rohrlich, 1992͒.
For the Ising model in a transverse ﬁeld it can be shown that ͑Verstraete, Popp, and Cirac, 2004͒

where s±ij = ͑1 ± ͗SizSjz͒͘2 − ͑͗Siz͘ ± ͗Sjz͒͘2 and Q␣ij = ͗Si␣Sj␣͘ − ͗Si␣͗͘Sj␣͘. In this case, the lower bound in Eq. ͑56͒ is determined by the two-point correlation function in the x direction. In the disordered phase ͑␭ Ͻ 1͒ the ground state possesses a small degree of entanglement and consequently its entanglement length is ﬁnite. The situation changes at the other side of the critical point. Here, although the correlation length is ﬁnite, the entanglement length is inﬁnite as asymptotically the correlation tends to ﬁnite values. The divergence of ␰E indicates that the ground state is a globally entangled state, supporting the general idea that multipartite entanglement is most relevant at the critical point ͑Osborne and Nielsen, 2002; Roscilde et al., 2004͒.
The properties of localizable entanglement were fur-
ther investigated for a spin-1 / 2 XXZ chain by Jin and Korepin ͑2004a͒ and Popp et al. ͑2005͒ as a function of the anisotropy parameter ⌬ and of an externally applied
magnetic ﬁeld h. These authors used exact results for correlation functions relying on the integrability of the models to ﬁnd the bounds in Eq. ͑56͒. For the antiferro-
magnetic XXX case they provided the lower bound Eloc͑i − j͒ ജ ͑2 / ␲2/3͒ln͉i − j͉ / ͉i − j͉. The presence of the anisotropy increases the lower bound of the localizable entanglement. At the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point ͑⌬ = 1͒ the lower bound of the nearest-neighbor

localizable entanglement shows a kink ͑Popp et al., 2005͒. As pointed out this might have implications in the general understanding of the Berezinskii-KosterlitzThouless phase transitions where the ground state energy and its derivatives are continuous as well as the concurrence ͑see Sec. IV.A.2 and Fig. 3͒.
The localizable entanglement in the two-dimensional XXZ model was discussed as well ͑Syljuåsen, 2003b͒ by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations. A lower bound has been determined by studying the maximum correlation function which for ⌬ Ͼ −1 is Qx, the longrange ͑power-law͒ decay of the correlation implying a long-ranged localizable entanglement.
The deﬁnition of localizable entanglement has an interesting connection with the concept of quantum repeaters introduced by Briegel et al. ͑1998͒. Quantum repeaters have been designed to enhance the transmission of entanglement through noisy channels. The idea is to distribute along the channels a number of intermediate sites where a certain number of local operations are allowed in order to maximize the entanglement between the transmitter and a receiver. This is the very deﬁnition of localizable entanglement.
Localizable entanglement has been deﬁned in Sec. II.C as an average over all possible measuring processes, it is of interest to also understand the statistical ﬂuctuations around this average value. To this end Popp et al. ͑2005͒ analyzed the variance associated to the entanglement ﬂuctuations: ␦El2oc= ͚spsE2͉͑␺s͒͘ − El2oc, where E is a measure of pairwise entanglement. Fluctuations of the entanglement increase in the vicinity of a critical point. This was checked explicitly for the one-dimensional Ising model. As detailed below, additional results were obtained for spin-1 systems where a true transition in the entanglement ͑with a diverging ␰E but ﬁnite correlation length͒ has been found.
B. Localizable entanglement in valence bond ground states
For half-integer spins, gapped nondegenerate ground states are characteristic for systems in a disordered phase ͑consider paramagnets, for example͒. A ﬁnite gap in the excitation spectrum of the system in the thermodynamic limit makes the correlations decaying exponentially. This is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, establishing that, under general hypothesis, the ground state of a spin system is either unique and gapless or gapped and degenerate ͑Lieb et al., 1961͒ ͓see Hastings ͑2004͔͒. It was a surprise when Haldane discovered that systems of integer spins can violate this theorem ͑Haldane, 1983a, 1983b͒. This suggests to investigate whether the entanglement in the ground state might play some role in establishing the hidden order characteristic for the Haldane phases. An aspect that might be relevant to this aim was addressed by studying the localizable entanglement in AKLT models ͑Verstraete, Martin-Delgado, and Cirac, 2004͒. The ground state of this class of models is the valence bond type as discussed in Sec. III.A.4:

͉I͘ are singlets and A are 3 ϫ 4 operators projecting the Hilbert space of two combined spins on its symmetric
part, at the given site. This is nothing other than a matrix product state ͑see Sec. III.A.4͒. For this state it was
demonstrated that a singlet state made of two spins 1 / 2 located at the ends of the chain can be always found ͑see Fig. 1͒. This implies that the localizable entanglement is long ranged despite the exponentially decaying correlation ͑Verstraete, Martin-Delgado, and Cirac, 2004͒.
The localizable entanglement can be related to the string order parameter Os␣tring deﬁned in Eq. ͑28͒. The key to this relation is to observe that the localizable en-
tanglement can be calculated as an expectation value ͑Campos Venuti and Roncaglia, 2005͒ as L͉͑␺͒͘ = ͗␺͉␴0Gs͑␺͒␴N͉␺͘, where Gs = ͚s͉s͗͘s¯͉sgn͑͗␺͉␴y  ␴y͉␺͒͘, and ͉s͘ is the optimal basis which maximizes the entanglement of assistance. For the AKLT model, the ex-
pression above reads

In this case, both the localizable entanglement and all three components of the string order parameter saturate. Perturbing the AKLT ground state, namely making the resonating valence bonds with nonmaximally en-
tangled states ͉͑10͘ − e−i2␾͉01͒͘ / ͱ2, the relation between
the hidden order and the localizable entanglement is weaken ͑as compared to the AKLT model͒: It has been demonstrated that the string order parameters for ␣
= x , z are ﬁnite, while the localizable entanglement vanishes exponentially with the deformation ␾ ͑Popp et al., 2005͒, but a tight connection of the localizable entanglement and Osytring is observed to persist also for the ␾ deformed ground state ͑Campos Venuti and Roncaglia, 2005͒.
The valence-bond-solid phase order was further studied by looking at the hidden order in chains with more complicated topology. The von Neumann entropy was
studied in the spin-1 XXZ model with biquadratic interaction and single ion anisotropy by Wang et al. ͑2005͒; Gu et al. ͑2006͒; and by Campos Venuti, Degli Esposti Boschi ͑2006͒. Some features of the corresponding phase diagram are captured. The Haldane transitions exhibited in the phase diagrams are marked by anomalies in the von Neumann entropy; its maximum at the isotropic point is not related to any critical phenomenon ͑the system is gapped around such a point͒, but it is due to the equiprobability of the three spin-1 states occurring at that point ͑Campos Venuti, Degli Esposti Boschi, et al., 2006͒. Since the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transi-
tion separating the XY from the Haldane or large-D phases connects a gapless with a gapped regime, it was speculated that an anomaly in the entanglement should highlight such a transition ͑Gu et al., 2006͒.

VII. THERMAL ENTANGLEMENT

Though the very nature of entanglement is purely

quantum mechanical, we saw that it can persist for mac-

roscopic systems and will survive even in the thermody-

namical limit. Entanglement survives also at ﬁnite tem-

perature. This temperature could be as high as 100 K in

high-temperature superconductors ͑Vedral, 2004a; see also Fan and Lloyd, 2005͒. In this section we review the

properties of entanglement in many-body systems at ﬁ-

nite temperatures ͑see also Anders and Vedral, 2007͒.

We show that the analysis could shed new light on the

interplay between the quantum nature of the system and

its thermodynamics. Moreover, somewhat surprisingly,

macroscopic state variables can be used to detect en-

tanglement. Thermodynamics describes large scale sys-

tems with macroscopic properties, state variables

T , N , V , p, external ﬁelds h, and response functions of

the susceptibility and heat capacity, respectively, ␹ , C,

etc. Addressing entanglement as a thermodynamical

property raised a signiﬁcant amount of interest in vari-

ous communities. One wants to know, for example, un-

der what conditions can we detect and extract entangle-

ment. Can we see entanglement itself as a state variable,

just like pressure is for a collection of atoms in a gas?

What could be the corresponding thermodynamical po-

tential? Is entanglement extensive? Since entanglement

is closely related to entropy, we would expect the answer

to the last question to be “yes.”

The states describing a system in thermal equili-

brium states are determined by the Hamiltonian and

the inverse temperature ␤ = ͑1 / T͒. The density matrix is ␳ = Z−1e−␤Hˆ , where Z = tr͑e−␤Hˆ ͒ is the partition function

of the system. The thermal states expanded in the en-

ergy eigenbasis ͉ei͘ , i = 0 , 1 , . . . are then

Any separable state, or classical state, with respect to this split into subsystems A , B , C , D , . . . ͑for example, the sites of a spin system͒ can then be written as a convex mixture of tensor products of states of the respective subsystems A , B , C , D , . . . with probabilities pi , ␳ = ͚ipi␳iA  ␳iB  ␳iC  ␳iD  ¯. If the state in Eq. ͑59͒ cannot be written in the form given above then it is en-
tangled. In this section we discuss the properties of this
thermal entanglement.

A. Thermal pairwise entanglement
Extensive efforts have been made to quantify thermal entanglement in many-body systems starting from Arnesen et al. ͑2001͒; Gunlycke et al. ͑2001͒; and Nielsen ͑2001͒. Several models of interacting spins in arrays were discussed. Entanglement as measured by concurrence was shown to exist at nonzero temperatures in the transverse Ising ͑Osborne and Nielsen, 2002͒, Heisenberg ͑Wang, 2002b; Wang and Zanardi, 2002; Asoudeh and

Karimipour, 2004; Tribedi and Bose, 2006͒, XXZ ͑Rossignoli and Canosa, 2005; Canosa and Rossignoli, 2006͒, and XYZ models ͑Rigolin, 2004; Zhang and Zhu, 2006͒, ferrimagnetic transition ͑Wang and Wang, 2006͒, and spin-one chains ͑Zhang and Li, 2005͒. Sevaral nontrivial aspects of the behavior of the pairwise entanglement at ﬁnite temperatures are illustrated by considering the simple case of two-site systems.
͑a͒ XXX model. We start our discussion on thermal
entanglement by considering the XXX antiferromagnet ͓see Eq. ͑23͔͒. In this case the thermal state of this system can be written as a Boltzmann mixture of the singlet and triplet states:

␳T

=

1 e3␤J͉␺−͗͘␺−͉ Z

+

e−␤͑J+2h͉͒00͗͘00͉

+ e−␤͑J−2h͉͒11͗͘11͉ + e−␤J͉␺+͗͘␺+͉,

͑60͒

where Z = e3␤J + e−␤͑J+2h͒ + e−␤͑J−2h͒ + e−␤J is the partition function of the system and ͉␺±͘ = ͉01͘ ± ͉10͘. For the sake of simplicity, we focus our attention on only two regimes.
The ﬁrst regime is when the coupling J is large com-
pared to the external ﬁeld h. The ground state is then the singlet state, and at low temperature the system is therefore entangled. At higher temperatures the triplet becomes mixed into the singlet, and when ͑roughly͒ T Ͼ J / k the entanglement completely disappears ͑when the external ﬁeld is zero͒. Therefore in order to have high-temperature entanglement in dimers we need a
large value of the coupling constant J.
When J is ﬁxed, the second regime occurs when we
vary the value of the external ﬁeld h. When h is large ͑greater than 2J͒, the ground state is ͉11͘ and at zero temperature the dimers are therefore not entangled. The point where the singlet state becomes replaced by ͉11͘ as the ground state corresponds to the quantum phase transition ͑occurring in the thermodynamical limit͒. However, if we start to increase the temperature, the singlet state—which is the ﬁrst excited state under these circumstances—starts to become populated. Entanglement can then be generated by increasing the temperature. The behavior of entanglement as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 16.
͑b͒ Ising model. Another interesting case is that of Ising coupling. At zero temperature only the lowest en-
ergy level is populated. In the case N = 2 the tangle of this pure state can be calculated from the density matrix, for h Ͼ 0, ␶1 = J2 / ͑J2 + hz2͒. It is clear that the entanglement is highest for nearly vanishing magnetic ﬁelds and decreases with increasing ﬁeld amplitude ͑this expression, however, is not valid for strictly h = 0, where no entanglement is present͒. We now turn our attention to the case of nonzero temperatures. For a general pure state only one of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian weight Eq. ͑59͒ is nonzero and therefore equal to the tangle. For low temperature and magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., h , T Ӷ J, it is a good approximation to assume that only the two lowest energy levels are populated. In this case,

Entanglement between two qubits interacting according to the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model as a function of the external ﬁeld hz and temperature ͑multiplied by the Boltzmann’s constant͒ T with coupling J = 1. The topmost plot shows the variation of nearest-neighbor entanglement with the magnetic ﬁeld. The middle and bottommost plots show the same for next-nearest and next-to-next-nearest neighbors, respectively, from Arnesen et al., 2001.

the combination of the two lowest states also combines their concurrences in the following way ͑Gunlycke et al., 2001͒:

C = max͕͉w0C0 − w1C1͉,0͖,

͑61͒

where the index 0 refers to the ground state, while 1

refers to the excited state, and w0 and w1 are the thermal weights of the ground and excited states, respectively;

see Eq. ͑59͒. This phenomenon has been named as con-

currence mixing. In this case, the ﬁrst excited state is the
Bell state ͉⌿−͘ = ͉͑01͘ − ͉10͒͘ / ͱ2 and Eq. ͑61͒ reduces to C = ͉w0͑J / ͱJ2 + hz2͒ − w1͉. In general, the ﬁrst term in the
above equation is larger than the second, and in this case

the concurrence decreases with temperature as w0 decreases and w1 increases. Moreover, it is also possible to see that, for a given temperature, the entanglement can

be increased by adjusting the magnetic ﬁeld and is gen-

erally largest for some intermediate value of the mag-

netic ﬁeld. This effect can be understood by noting that

w0 increases between the

separation decreases.

As a result the combined function reaches a peak as we

vary h and decreases subsequently, inducing analogous

behavior for the concurrence.

B. Pairwise entanglement in the T Å 0 critical region
At ﬁnite temperatures but close to quantum critical points, quantum ﬂuctuations are essential to describe the properties of the systems ͑Chakravarty et al., 1989; Sachdev, 1999͒. In order to study the interplay between the thermal entanglement and quantum ﬂuctuations

caused by the critical point at T = 0 analysis on small clusters is no longer sufﬁcient. For the presentation we
consider the one-dimensional quantum XY models. Such systems cannot exhibit any phase transitions at ﬁnite temperature, but the existence of the quantum criti-
cal point is reﬂected in the crossover behavior at T 0. The renormalized classical crosses over the quantum disordered regimes through the so-called quantum critical region ͑Sachdev, 1999͒. In the T-h plane a V-shaped phase diagram emerges, characterized by the crossover temperature customarily deﬁned as TcrossЏ ͉␭−1 − ␭c−1͉. For T Ӷ Tcross the thermal de Broglie length is much smaller than the average spacing of excitations; therefore the correlation functions factorize in two contributions coming from quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations separately. The quantum critical region is characterized by T ӷ Tcross. Here we are in the ﬁrst regime and the correlation functions do not factorize. In this regime the interplay between quantum and thermal effects is the dominant phenomenon affecting the physical behavior of the system.
Thermal entanglement close to the critical point of
the quantum XY models was studied by Amico and Patané ͑2007͒. In analogy with the zero-temperature case they demonstrated that the entanglement sensitivity to
thermal and to quantum ﬂuctuations obeys universal T
0 scaling laws. The crossover to the quantum disordered and renormalized classical regimes in the entanglement has been analyzed by the derivatives of the concurrence ‫␭ץ‬C and ‫ץ‬TC. The thermal entanglement results to be very rigid when the quantum critical regime is accessed from the renormalized classical and quantum disordered regions of the phase diagram; such a “stiffness” is reﬂected in a maximum in ‫ץ‬TC at T ϳ Tcross. The maximum in the derivatives of the concurrence seems a general feature of the entanglement in the crossover regime. In this respect we mention also that the concurrence between two Kondo impurity spins discussed by Stauber and Guinea ͑2004, 2006b͒ experiences the largest variation in the crossover phenomenon.
Due to the vanishing of the gap at the quantum critical point, in the region T ӷ Tcross an arbitrarily small temperature is immediately effective in the system ͑see Fig. 17͒. From the analysis of the quantum mutual information ͓see Eq. ͑9͔͒ it emerges that the contribution of classical correlations is negligible in the crossover, thus providing indication that such a phenomenon is driven solely by the thermal entanglement. It is interesting to
study how the existence of the factorizing ﬁeld hf affects the thermal pairwise entanglement ͑vanishing at zero temperature͒. It is found that the two tangle ␶2 still vanishes in a region of the h-T plane, fanning out from just hf ͑white region in Fig. 18͒ ͑Amico et al., 2006͒. If entanglement is present it is shared between three or more parties.
It is further observed that, in contrast to the analysis of the ground state, at ﬁnite temperature we cannot characterize the two separate phases of parallel and antiparallel entanglement. In fact, the two types of en-

T = T* and T = TM are drawn as dashed and thick lines, respectively. Maxima below T* are found at TM = ␤Tcross with ␤ ϳ 0.290± 0.005 and are independent of ␥ and R; the crossover behavior is enclosed between two ﬂexes of ‫ץ‬T͓‫ץ‬aC͑R͔͒ at Tc1 Tc2; such values are ﬁxed to Tc1 = ͑0.170± 0.005͒Tcross and Tc2 = ͑0.442± 0.005͒Tcross and independent of ␥ and R.

tanglement ͑though well deﬁned also for mixed states͒ can swap by varying T and/or r. The exchange between parallel and antiparallel entanglement occurs in a nontrivial way that ultimately produces the reentrance of ␶2 seen in Fig. 18.
The common feature in all cases for which the existence of entanglement could be proven is that both high temperatures and high values of magnetic ﬁeld move the thermal states away from the region with nonzero entanglement. This is understandable because high values of magnetic ﬁeld tend to order all spins parallel to the ﬁeld which corresponds to an overall state being a product of the individual spin states. There is upper limit of

C. Thermal entanglement witnesses

At ﬁrst sight it may be surprising that thermodynami-

cal variables can witness entanglement since what is re-

quired to obtain them are the system’s eigenenergies,

and no eigenstate information is required. Since en-

tanglement resides in the fact that the state is insepa-

rable ͑and is not related to the value of its energy͒, it

would appear that the partition function is not enough

to characterize entanglement. This logic, although seem-

ingly simple, is not entirely correct. The reason is subtle

and lies in the fact that the whole Hamiltonian is used

for constructing the partition function, so in a round-

about way we do have information about the states as

well. Entanglement witnesses in spin systems have been

considered by Brukner and Vedral ͑2004͒; Tóth ͑2005͒;

Wu et al. ͑2005͒; Hide et al. ͑2007͒ ͑see also the next

section on multipartite entanglement͒.

We now illustrate how and why we can derive en-

tanglement witnesses for the partition function. Suppose

that the system is described by an antiferromagnetic

Heisenberg model. First, we have the following iden-

tity coming from the Hellman-Feynman theorem

This

means

that

the two point correlations function summed over all

nearest neighbors can be derived from the partition

function. This is also a quantity that can be accessed

experimentally as is usually performed in solid state ex-

periments. Most importantly, this average has in general

different values for separable and entangled states. It

can, therefore, serve as an entanglement witness as will

be seen shortly. The fact that will emerge is that, in order

to say if a state is entangled, we do not need to have the

analytically calculated form of the eigenstates in order

to tell if the resulting mixture is entangled. One price to

pay for this is that we will only be able to derive a suf-

ﬁcient condition for entanglement that is typical of en-

tanglement witnesses. Namely, we will be able to tell if

for some conditions the resulting thermal state is en-

tangled, but we will not be able to say with certainty that

the state is not entangled if these conditions are vio-

lated.

entanglement witness is physically equivalent to the ex-

change interaction energy or, equivalently, to the differ-

ence between the total ͑internal͒ energy U and the mag-

netic energy −hM. From the tracelessness of the Pauli

operators one can see that limT→ϱ U → 0. This means that the value of the internal energy as given by Eq. ͑64͒

should be deﬁned relative to the referent value of zero

energy in the limit of high temperatures. In order to

complete the proof we need to give an explicit example

of a state that violates Eq. ͑63͒ ͑or the corresponding

inequality for the XX model͒. This implies that Eq. ͑64͒

is indeed an entanglement witness and not just a bound

that is trivially satisﬁed by any quantum state.

As an example of such a state we take the ground

state of the antiferromagnetic isotropic XXX Heisen-

berg model with zero magnetic ﬁeld. The energy of this

state was found to be ͑Hulthén, 1938͒ ͉E0 / JN͉ = 0.443 25Ͼ 1 / 4. Furthermore, due to the symmetry of

the XXX Heisenberg Hamiltonian one has E0 / 3NJ = ͗SixSix+1͘0 = ͗SiySiy+1͘0 = ͗SizSiz+1͘0 = −1.773 / 12 for every i. This implies that ͑1 / N͉͚͒iN=1͑͗SixSix+1͘0 + ͗SiySiy+1͘0͉͒ = 0.295 Ͼ 1 / 4. Therefore Eq. ͑64͒ is an entanglement witness for

the solid state systems described by XXX or XX

Heisenberg interaction.

We now discuss various spin interaction models some

of which are exactly solvable and whose dependence of

internal energy U and magnetization M on temperature

T and magnetic ﬁeld h are known. This will help us to

determine the parameter regions of T and h where one

has entanglement in the solids.

We ﬁrst consider the XXX Heisenberg model with no

magnetic ﬁeld, in this case the magnetization vanishes

and the thermodynamical witness, Eq. ͑64͒, reduces to

͉U͉ Ͼ N͉J͉ / 4. It was shown that concurrence C͑1͒ is zero

at any temperature in the ferromagnetic case and that it

is

in

the

antiferro-

magnetic case ͑Wang and Zanardi, 2002͒. Thus C is non-

zero if and only if ͉U͉ / ͑NJ͒ Ͼ 1 / 4. This shows that the

thermodynamical entanglement witness can detect en-

tire bipartite entanglement as measured by concurrence.

Furthermore, the fact that the value of the entanglement

witness for the ground state is well above the limit of 1 / 4

suggests that entanglement could exist and be detected

by the thermodynamical witness at nonzero tempera-

tures. In the presence of a ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld the low
temperature partition function is given by Z
= e␤͑J+hz͒/4͑1 + e−␤hz/2N / ͱ2␲␤J͒. Using this we obtain ͉U
+ hzM͉ / ͑NJ͒ = 1 / 4 and thus no entanglement can be detected in agreement with Asoudeh and Karimipour ͑2004͒ and Pratt ͑2004͒.
The XX Heisenberg model with nonzero magnetic ﬁeld is the most interesting as it is exactly solvable, the partition function was found by Katsura ͑1962͒. We in-
troduce the dimensionless quantities b = hz / T and K = J / T ͓note a difference of a factor of 2 in the deﬁnitions of J and K with respect to Katsura ͑1962͔͒ and the func-
tion f͑K , b , ␻͒ = ͱ2K2 + 2K2 cos 2␻ − 4bK cos ␻ + C2 for
convenience. Then the internal energy is given by ͑Katsura, 1962͒

in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. We use Eqs. ͑65͒ and ͑66͒ to determine the parameter
regions of temperature T and magnetic ﬁeld hz for which entanglement exists in the solid state system. The critical
values of T and h below which entanglement can be
detected is of the order of J, which can be as high as 10 K ͑Hammar et al., 1999͒.
It should be stressed that the analysis based on the entanglement witness can be applied to any model for which we can successfully obtain the partition function. This feature is the main advantage of using the thermodynamic witnesses approach to detecting entanglement. This method for determining entanglement in solids within the models of Heisenberg interaction is useful in the cases where other methods fail due to incomplete knowledge of the system. This is the case when only the eigenvalues but not eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are known ͑which is the most usual case in solid state physics͒ and thus no measure of entanglement can be computed. Furthermore, in the cases where we lack the complete description of the systems one can approach the problem experimentally and determine the value of the thermodynamical entanglement witness by performing appropriate measurements. It is important to emphasize that any other thermodynamical function of state could be a suitable witness, such as the magnetic susceptibility or heat capacity ͑Wiesniak et al., 2005͒; see next section.
The temperature as well as other thermodynamical state variables have been shown to behave also as entanglement witnesses of spatial entanglement ͑Anders et al., 2006͒. This general feature was explicitly worked out in the case of a noninteracting bosonic gas. It was found that entanglement can exist at arbitrarily high temperatures, provided that one can probe smaller and smaller regions of space.

The methods outlined here are not only applicable to the models we considered. There are several interesting questions and possibilities for generalizations such as consideration of Hamiltonians with higher spins, twoand three-dimensional systems, non-nearest interactions, anisotropies, other thermodynamical properties ͑e.g., heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility͒, and so on. Similar analysis can be done for continuous thermal entanglement in a ﬁeld. It has been shown that for noninteracting bosons entanglement exists when their de Broglie thermal wavelength is smaller than their average separation a ͑Anders et al., 2006͒. The precise condition is kT Ͻ ប2 / 2ma2, where m is the mass of bosonic particles. We now introduce the following correspondence between spin coupling J and the continuous variables bosonic kinetic energy J = ប2 / 2ma2. This implies that we can think of the thermal de Broglie wavelength for spins
as ␭dB= aͱJ / T, where a is the spin separation. The con-
dition for entanglement that the wavelength is larger than the lattice spacing a now leads us to the condition that T Ͻ J which is exactly the result obtained from a more detailed analysis above.
D. Experimental results
The question of having macroscopic entanglement is not only fascinating in its own right but it also has a fundamental signiﬁcance as it pushes the realm of quantum physics well into the macroscopic world, thus opening the possibility to test quantum theory versus alternative theories well beyond the scales on which theirs predictions coincide. It also has important practical implications for implementation of quantum information processing. If the future quantum computer is to reach the stage of wide commercial application, it should share the same feature as the current ͑classical͒ information technology and be based on solid state systems. It will thus be important to derive the critical values of physical parameters ͑e.g., the high-temperature limit͒ above which one cannot harness quantum entanglement in solids as a resource for quantum information processing.
It was demonstrated experimentally that entanglement can affect macroscopic properties of solids, albeit at very low ͑critical͒ temperature ͑below 1 K͒ ͑Ghosh et al., 2003͒. This result opens a possibility that purely quantum correlations between microscopic constituents of the solid may be detected by only a small number of macroscopic thermodynamical properties.
Ghosh et al. made measurement on an insulating salt, LiHoF4. At low temperatures the susceptibility deviates from a simple Curie-type law. They found that the temperature dependence is well ﬁtted by a power law ␹ ϳ T−␣, with ␣ = 0.75. The key observation made by Ghosh et al. ͑2003͒ is that the experimental data at low temperatures cannot be explained by simply resorting to a classical approximation. By itself this might not be enough. It is remarkable, however, that these authors are able to put in close connection the power-law divergence of the susceptibility with the entanglement

present in the low-lying excited states; see Fig. 19. Vértesi and Bene studied the magnetic susceptibility
of NaV3O7 and used macroscopic entanglement witnesses as discussed in the previous section to estimate the critical temperature below which thermal entanglement is present. The experimental value of this temperature is 365 K approximately three times higher than the critical temperature corresponding to the vanishing of bipartite entanglement ͑Vertési and Bene, 2006͒. We also mention the recent experiment reporting on macroscopic magnetic measurements of the pyroborate MgMnB22O5 and warwickite MgTiOBO3 ͓Rappoport et al., 2007; see also Continentino ͑2006͔͒.
Earlier experimental data witnessing entanglement in bulk properties of solids have been reanalyzed by Brukner et al. ͑2006͒. They discussed the experimental results of neutron scattering measurement of CN ͑Xu et al., 2000͒ and showed that they provided a direct experimental demonstration of macroscopic entanglement in solids. The experimental characterization of the dynamic spin correlations for next neighboring sites enabled them to determine the concurrence and show the existence of entanglement at moderately high temperatures ͑as high as 5 K͒. In the same work they also showed that magnetic susceptibility at zero magnetic ﬁeld is a macroscopic thermodynamical entanglement witness for the class of solid states systems that can be modeled by a strongly alternating spin-1 / 2 antiferromagnet chain ͑Brukner et al., 2006͒. The measured values for magnetic susceptibility of CN ͑Berger et al., 1963͒ imply the presence of entanglement in the same temperature range ͑below 5 K͒.

An analysis of the experimental results of a magnetic susceptibility measurement of CN ͑Berger et al., 1963͒ showing that the values measured at low temperatures cannot be explained without entanglement being present was performed by Brukner et al. ͑2006͒. This was based on the general proof that magnetic susceptibility
of any strongly alternating antiferromagnetic spin-1 / 2 chain is a macroscopic thermodynamical entanglement witness. As discussed by Brukner et al. ͑2006͒ the magnetic susceptibility for separable states is bounded by

VIII. MULTIPARTITE ENTANGLEMENT
Most of the results reviewed in the previous section are for pairwise entanglement. Although much has been learned from the study of those quantities, the structure of entanglement in many-body systems is much richer and it is natural to expect that multipartite entanglement is present both in the ground state and at ﬁnite temperatures. Although multipartite entanglement in manybody systems is much less studied, some important results have been already obtained.
A number of groups showed that in certain limits the state of a spin chain can resemble that of known multipartite states. For small chains Wang ﬁrst noted that the ground state tends to have multipartite entanglement ͑Wang, 2002a͒. This analysis was further pursued in Ising and Heisenberg rings where the ground state has GHZ͑Stelmachovi~ and Bužek, 2004͒ and W-like ͑Bruß et al.,

a W state. At ﬁnite but low temperatures the density matrix is given approximately as ␳ = p͉0 ¯ 0͗͘0 ¯ 0͉ + ͑1 − p͉͒W͗͘W͉, where p is the Boltzmann factor and ͉0¯0͘ is the ferromagnetic ground state. For three qubits ␳ has been shown to contain tripartite entanglement by Bruß and Macchiavello ͑2003͒.
These examples show that several models naturally have multipartite entangled ground states. At the same time it also shows that it is important to quantify multipartite entanglement in many-body systems. Analysis in this direction is reviewed below.

A. Multipartite entanglement in spin systems
A ﬁrst way to estimate multipartite entanglement in a spin system is provided by the entanglement ratio ␶2 / ␶1 as the amount of two spin relative to global entanglement. For 1D XYZ models it was shown that a small value of such a ratio is generic in these systems with a cusp minimum at the quantum critical point ͑Roscilde et al., 2004͒. This is shown numerically for the XYZ chain in a ﬁeld ͑Fig. 21͒.
In order to quantify the multipartite entanglement, Wei et al. calculated the geometric measure of entanglement ͑Wei and Goldbart, 2003͒, see Sec. II.E, for the transverse XY chain ͑Wei et al., 2005͒. The calculation can be done by a clever use of symmetries: translational invariance and periodic boundary conditions. In this case, the set of all possible separable states can be described by a global rotation around the y axis of the fully polarized state. The maximization is thus reduced to only one variable.
As well as in the case of bipartite entanglement, the multipartite measure of Wei et al. is sensitive to the existence of QPTs. As a paradigmatic example these authors analyzed the phase diagram in the anisotropy-

FIG. 22. ͑Color online͒ The geometric entanglement measure Eq. ͑12͒ per site versus ␥ and hz for the XY model. There are three different phases: the ordered oscillatory phase for ␥2 + hz2 Ͻ 1 and ␥ 0, the ordered ferromagnetic phase between ͑␥2 + h͒z2 Ͼ 1 and h Ͻ 1, and the paramagnetic phase for hz Ͼ 1. There is a sharp rise in the entanglement across the quantum phase transition line ␭−1 = hz = 1. At ␥ = 0 lies the XX model, which belongs to a different universality class than the aniso-
tropic XY model. From Wei et al., 2005.

magnetic ﬁeld plane. Their results are shown in Fig. 22. As expected there is no divergence in the measure itself but in its derivative. The new aspect here is that different from the concurrence the multipartite entanglement measure in Eq. ͑12͒ can be expanded as a function of n-point correlators.
The geometric entanglement cannot discriminate between different n-particle entanglement classes. A comprehensive classiﬁcation in spin systems has been given by Gühne et al. ͑2005͒ via the concept of k-producibility ͑see Sec. II.E͒. The systems analyzed in detail are the one-dimensional XY and Heisenberg models. Different types of n-particle quantum correlated states lead to distinct bounds for the internal energy ͑or the ground state energy at T = 0͒. Violation of these bounds implies the presence of certain k-party producible entanglement in the system. As pointed out by Gühne et al. ͑2005͒, aiming at the thermodynamic limit of an inﬁnite number of spins, the notion of k-producibility is easier to handle than the n-separability ͑see Sec. II.E͒ as its deﬁnition is independent of the number of sites in the system.
A systematic approach for deriving energy bounds for states without certain forms of multipartite entanglement has been developed by Gühne and Toth ͑2006͒. The method allows one to investigate higher dimen-

sional and frustrated systems. As an example we report the results for the Heisenberg model. In d dimension, the energy bounds per bond for one-, two-, three-, and four-producible states are given in Table I. It is striking how relatively close the 2- and 3-producible bounds are in all cases. All bounds given above are found to be violated in the ground state. In the previous expression the superscripts refer to the dimensionality of the model and the subscripts to the k-party entanglement for which the bound is obtained. There is a factor of 1 / 4 of difference with respect to the original paper because of the different notation used in this review.
Corresponding to the energy scales ﬁxed by the bounds there are different temperature scales at which the various n-party entanglement types disappear. As one would expect, these crossover temperatures are monotonic in k, i.e., Tk ജ Tk+1. The example given in Fig. 23 shows how higher order multipartite entanglement progressively disappears as the temperature increases.

B. Global entanglement

Multipartite entanglement close to quantum phase

transitions was quantiﬁed by the global-entanglement

Egl measure of Meyer and Wallach ͑see Sec. II.E͒ by de Oliveira, Rigolin, and de Oliveira ͑2006͒; de Oliveira,

Rigolin, et al. ͑2006͒; and Somma et al. ͑2004͒. Together

with the Meyer-Wallach measure, de Oliveira et al. also

introduced a slight extension of it as

where ␳j,j+l is the reduced density matrix associated to sites j and j + l. Similarly one can consider three-body reduced density matrices and construct the corresponding global entanglement measure. According to de Oliveira et al. the above hierarchy provides a comprehensive description of entanglement in many-body systems. Explicit calculations for the one-dimensional Ising model ͑de Oliveira, Rigolin, and de Oliveira, 2006͒ showed that both Egl and Eg͑2l͒ are maximal at the critical

point ͑with EglϽ Eg͑2l͒ for any value of the coupling constant͒ suggesting that the quantum critical point is characterized by the presence of multipartite entanglement. As in the case of concurrence the nonanalyticity associated with the critical point is manifest in the derivative of the global entanglement measure. Extending an earlier approach developed by Wu et al. ͑2004͒, de Oliveira et al. also showed how the nonanalytic behavior of Eg͑nl ͒ is related to that of the ground state energy. Note that from Eq. ͑68͒ it is possible to deﬁne an entanglement length proportional to the correlation length ␰. This differs considerably from the one deﬁned by the localizable entanglement ͓see Eq. ͑55͔͒; the latter is always bounded from below by the correlation length and can even be divergent where ␰ is ﬁnite.
As discussed by Facchi et al. ͑2006, 2007͒ the analysis of the average purity might not be sufﬁcient and analysis of the purity distribution for different partitions could give additional information. Rather than measuring multipartite entanglement in terms of a single number, one characterizes it by using a whole function. One studies the distribution function of the purity ͑or other measures of entanglement͒ over all bipartitions of the system. If the distribution is sufﬁciently regular, its average and variance will constitute characteristic features of the global entanglement: the average will determine the “amount” of global entanglement in the system, while the variance will measure how such entanglement is distributed. A smaller variance will correspond to a larger insensitivity to the choice of the bipartition and, therefore, will be characteristic for different types of multipartite entanglement. Application of this technique to the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in a transverse ﬁeld shows that the distribution function is wellbehaved and its average and second moment are good indicators of the quantum phase transition ͑Costantini et al., 2007͒. This is in agreement with previously obtained results. At the onset of the QPT both the average and the standard deviation exhibit a peak that becomes more pronounced as the number of qubits is increased.
C. Generalized entanglement
A different route for studying the multipartite entanglement is paved by the general observable based entanglement ͑see Sec. II.E͒. It was ﬁrst pursued by Somma et al. for the LMG and the quantum XY model. In the realm of solid state systems an experimental protocol to measure many-fermion entanglement based on this concept has been proposed by Kindermann ͑2006͒. A connection which emerges the work of Somma et al. is the one between the generalized entanglement and quantum ﬂuctuations of the magnetization which are responsible for the quantum phase transition ͑Somma et al., 2004͒. Later, Montangero and Viola considered the dynamical behavior of generalized entanglement in disordered systems ͑Montangero and Viola, 2006͒. As remarked by Somma et al. ͑2004͒, it is important to choose

the appropriate subset of observables in order to see the

critical behavior in the entanglement.

In the case of the LMG model a natural choice for the

local observables was to consider the purity relative to

the spin-N / 2 representation of the angular momentum

PS = ͑4 / N2͓͒͗Sx͘2 + ͗Sy͘2 + ͗Sz͘2͔. Somma et al. also considered the purity relative to the single observable Sz: PSz = ͑4 / N2͓͒͗Sz͘2͔. With this last choice the relation be-

tween the multipartite entanglement and the order pa-

rameter becomes evident. The result is shown in Fig. 24.

Further interesting results emerge from the XY

model. By choosing the following subset of operators

expressed in terms of the spinless fermions of the

Jordan-Wigner
− ci†Јci͒ , ͱ2͑ci†ci −

transform u͑N͒ = 1 / 2͖͒ it is possible

span͕ci†ciЈ + ci†Јci , i͑ci†ciЈ to show that the asso-

ciated purity may be considered as a disorder parameter,

i.e., it is nonzero in the symmetric phase only. A trans-

parent way to express the purity in this case is to relate

it to the variance of the number fermion operator Nf = ͚ici†ci. The result is plotted in Fig. 25 for different values of the anisotropy parameter ␥. Two considerations

are in order at this stage. First, it is clear from the pre-

vious example that important properties of entangle-

ment appear when one moves away from the conven-

tional picture of partitioning in real space. Second, the

purity shows different from other measures as the con-

currence, direct indications of critical behavior ͑and not

only in the derivatives͒.

D. Renormalization group for quantum states
We continue our discussion on multipartite entanglement with recent work ͑Verstraete et al., 2006͒ where the method of renormalization group was applied to quantum states and not, as traditionally done, to the Hamiltonian. The renormalization group is based on a recursive transformation which leads to an effective description of the low-energy ͑long distance͒ physics of a given system where all effects of high energy modes are

included in a renormalization of certain coupling constants of the model Hamiltonian. A ﬂow study of these recursive equations, their ﬁxed point͑s͒, and the behavior of the ﬂow close to the ﬁxed points allows one to determine the critical behavior of the system under consideration. Contrary to the conventional renormalization group approach, the idea of Verstraete et al. is to analyze how the quantum states change under this coarse graining and to classify their ﬁxed points. Given a system characterized by N sites and a D-dimensional local Hilbert space. The steps of this real space renormalization procedure are the following.
͑i͒ Coarse graining, in which clusters of neighboring sites are merged into one site of a new lattice.
͑ii͒ Rescaling of the local variables associated to the new sites.
͑iii͒ Identiﬁcation of the states which are invariant under local unitary transformation ͑long distance behavior should not depend on the choice of the local basis͒.
͑iv͒ Rescale the distances in order to have a unit lattice constant.
In this way a representative of a given class of quantum states, invariant under local transformations, is transformed at each step. The irreversibility of the transformation is crucially related to step ͑iii͒ of the transformation as one loses track of the unitary transformation performed ͑which needs to be local over the cluster͒.
Verstraete et al. carried out explicitly the renormalization group transformation for matrix product states ͑MPS͒, see Eq. ͑29͒. The decimation step in which two neighboring sites, say i and i + 1, are merged together is performed by merging the corresponding matrices Api and Api+1 into A˜ ␣pi␤,pi+1 = ͚␥m=in1͑DM2 PS,D2͒A␣pi␥A␥p␤i+1. With a singular value decomposition of A˜ it is possible to ﬁnd the representative of the new state ͓see step ͑iii͔͒ and therefore to iterate the renormalization group map. In the

case DMPS= 2, Verstraete et al. provided a complete classiﬁcation of the ﬁxed point transformation which con-
tains product, GHZ, and domain wall states. A similar analysis in the case DMPSϾ 2 and/or in higher dimensional systems may turn out to be useful for the classiﬁ-
cation of multipartite entanglement in many-body sys-
tems.

E. Entanglement distribution for Gaussian states

It has been observed in Sec. II.G that the symmetry groups of admissible local transformations of Gaussian states and qubits are isomorphic. This suggests to look for further analogies with the qubit case or to search for deviations from it. A striking feature of qubit entanglement is the monogamy as far as entanglement distribution along chains of qubits is concerned ͑see Sec. II.B͒. For continuous variable entanglement such an inequality was originally analyzed analytically for fully symmetric Gaussian states and numerically for randomly chosen Gaussian states by Adesso and Illuminati ͑2005a͒. The general proof of monogamy has been obtained by Hiroshima et al. ͑2007͒. In this section we use the particular case of a symmetric state as a guideline to discuss the monogamy for Gaussian states. A more detailed discussion and the general proof can be found in the review by Adesso and Illuminati ͑2007͒.
A Gaussian state is called fully symmetric if and only if its covariance matrix is invariant with respect to permutations of the modes. Its covariance matrix can then be written as ͑Adesso et al., 2004a͒

where ␤ˆ and ␧ˆ are 2 ϫ 2 matrices. Both can be diagonalized by means of local symplectic transformations in
phase space, such that ␤ˆ = diag͕b , b͖ and ␧ˆ = diag͕␧1 , ␧2͖. This leads to a highly degenerate symplectic spectrum
where n − 1 doubly degenerate symplectic eigenvalues are equal to ␯ = ͑b − ␧1͒͑b − ␧2͒ and the remaining eigenvalue is ␯n = ͓b + ͑n − 1͒␧1͔͓b + ͑n − 1͒␧2͔. After a partial transposition, n − 2 symplectic eigenvalues ␯ remain un-
affected. The negativity is then determined solely by ␯˜ −, which is the smaller one of the remaining two affected eigenvalues ␯± ͑Adesso et al., 2004a͒. This is due to the fact that the uncertainty leads to a lower bound ប2 / 4 for the product ␯+␯−.

V1, the tangle is given by ␶1 = 2͑1 − det V1͒ / ͱdet V1. The
quantity which is analog to the pairwise tangle has been
identiﬁed as the square of the logarithmic negativity,

␶2͑␯˜ −͒ = ͓ln ␯˜ −͔2,

͑70͒

and has been termed contangle by Adesso and Illuminati ͑2005a͒. Identiﬁcation of the square negativity as

the continuous variable tangle is crucial for the demonstration of the monogamy inequality. Extensions of these measures to mixed states are given by the corresponding convex roofs ͑Uhlmann, 2000͒, where the average of the pure state measure of entanglement has to be minimized over all pure state decompositions of the density matrix. Restriction to decompositions purely out of Gaussian states gave rise to the notion of the Gaussian entanglement measures ͑Wolf et al., 2004͒ and the Gaussian entanglement of formation. It clearly establishes an upper bound for the entanglement of formation.
Negativity and Gaussian entanglement measures have been analyzed by Adesso and Illuminati ͑2005b͒ for twomode Gaussian states with particular focus on symmetric Gaussian states. One important result is that negativity and Gaussian measures lead to different ordering of Gaussian states with respect to their entanglement. For symmetric Gaussian states instead, both give the same ordering. This result must be handled with care, since it is not obvious what precisely the restriction to Gaussian decompositions entails for the ordering of states. Believing in the striking similarity to qubit systems, one might be tempted to conjecture that for symmetric Gaussian states a purely Gaussian optimal decomposition always existed.
There are two extremal classes of two-mode Gaussian states considered: for ﬁxed local and global purity, those states that maximize the negativity are termed Gaussian maximally entangled mixed states ͑GMEMS͒ introduced by Adesso et al. ͑2004b͒, whereas those states minimizing the negativity have been termed GLEMS, which are states whose covariance matrix has one symplectic eigenvalue equal to 1 ͑mixed states with partial minimal uncertainty͒. The symmetric two-mode Gaussian states have been singled out as those states containing minimal Gaussian entanglement at ﬁxed negativity ͑Adesso and Illuminati, 2005b͒.
The entanglement sharing inequality for Gaussian states assumes the same form as for qubits ␶1,i ജ ͚j i␶2,ij, where the indices are the numbers of the various distinguishable modes in a multimode Gaussian state. This inequality has been proven for multimode Gaussian states by Hiroshima et al. ͑2007͒. In the particular case of symmetric states ␶1,i ϵ ␶1,1 and ␶2,ij = ␶2,12 for all indices i , j.
As for qubit systems one can deﬁne a residual contangle by the difference ␶n ª ␶1,i − ͚jn i␶2,ij as a quantiﬁer of the multipartite entanglement present in a Gaussian state. In particular, the residual contangle is an entanglement monotone under Gaussian LOCC. An important difference, however, arises as compared to the residual tangle for qubits: not even for three modes is the residual tangle invariant under permutations of the modes
and its minimum with respect to the common mode i has to be taken. Even for symmetric Gaussian states, where this anomaly is absent, a promiscuous nature of continuous variable entanglement is encountered, in sharp contrast to the monogamy inherent to qubit entanglement ͑Coffman et al., 2000; Yu and Song, 2005; Osborne and

Amico et al.: Entanglement in many-body systems

Verstraete, 2006͒. The term promiscuous is an interpretation of the fact that the maximal residual contangle ␶3 in a symmetric Gaussian three-mode state without pairwise contangle ␶2 is smaller than the maximum possible residual contangle without this restriction. Having in mind the entanglement sharing inequality, this implies that the local contangle ␶1 is larger when ␶2 and ␶3 coexist. It is worth noting at this point that the peculiarity of Gaussian states is completely described by two-point correlation functions. Consequently, all types of multipartite entanglement are inextricably related in that the same type of correlations are responsible for either type of quantum correlation. This is not the case for nonGaussian states and in particular not for qubit systems or general higher-dimensional local Hilbert spaces.
IX. DYNAMICS OF ENTANGLEMENT
The interest in studying the properties of entanglement in a many-body system has been recently directed also to the understanding of its dynamical behavior. Entanglement dynamics has been studied from different perspectives. In a spirit similar to the study of propagation of excitations in condensed matter systems, several works analyzed the propagation of entanglement starting from a given initial state where the entanglement has been created in a given portion of the many-body system. One can imagine, for example, to initialize a spin chain such that all spins are pointing upwards except two neighboring spins which are entangled. Due to the exchange interaction the entanglement, initially localized on two neighboring sites of the chain, will spread. This propagation is ballistic in clean systems. A “sound velocity” for excitations results in a ﬁnite speed for the propagation of excitations. If some weak disorder is present one might expect diffusion. Entanglement localization and chaotic behavior can eventually also be observed. An alternative approach is to start with the ground state of a Hamiltonian H0 and let the Hamiltonian change in time. Most of the attention up to now has been devoted to the case of sudden quench, i.e., after the preparation the Hamiltonian suddenly changes to H1. Moreover, since we are mostly dealing with interacting systems, entanglement can be also generated or it can change its characteristics during the dynamical evolution.
Another important aspect of entanglement dynamics is the possibility to generate entangled states with given properties by taking advantage of interactions present in many-body systems. This is the natural generalization of the case where a Bell state can be obtained by letting two qubits interact for a ﬁxed time by means of an exchange coupling of XX symmetry. In the same spirit one can think to generate three-bit entangled GHZ or W states or multipartite entangled states by tailoring the appropriate exchange couplings in spin networks.

Hamiltonian amounts to a propagation of the single ﬂipped spin through the chain. The speed of propagation is set up by the interaction strengths. The information exchange or entanglement propagation over a distance of d lattice spacings takes time t ϳ បd / J. The external ﬁeld h does not enter into Eq. ͑73͒, since all components of the state are in the same sector where one spin has been ﬂipped and therefore it contributes only to an overall dynamical phase to the state evolution.
Having in mind the use of spin chains as quantum channels, the preparation scheme described above does not lead to faithful entanglement transfer. The most natural way to perform this task is to prepare the entangled state and then let only one of the qubits propagate along the spin chain ͓thereby following the protocol originally proposed by ͑Bose 2003͒ or its modiﬁed version ͑Christandl et al., 2004͒ to achieve perfect transfer with a modulated chain͔. A detailed analysis in this direction was recently performed by Hartmann et al. ͑2006͒. They considered initial maximally entangled states and used the chain to transfer the state of one of the two qubits, found a relation between a measurement of the entanglement ﬁdelity at the ﬁdelity of state transfer, and concluded that there are possibilities to have perfect entanglement transfer.
If the chain is initially prepared in ͉⌿±͑t = 0͒͘, given in Eq. ͑71͒, the entanglement propagates maintaining its original characteristics. This is not the case if, for example, the initial states of the two entangled sites is of
the type ͉⌽±͘ = ͑1 / ͱ2͉͒͑00͘ ± ͉11͒͘. These states are super-
positions of components belonging to different magnetization sectors. The entanglement propagates with the same velocity as before, however, under certain conditions, it turns out that the propagating quantum correlations change their character. After some time a singletlike entangled state propagates even if the initial state was not a singlet. A different set of initial states has also been considered. In Hamieh and Katsnelson ͑2005͒ the chain was initialized in a separable state by means of a set of projective measurement ͑in particular they consid-
ered all spins aligned in the z direction except one prepared in an eigenstate of Sx͒. The evolution can be described using the same approach as outlined above. The new ingredient now is the creation of entanglement during the dynamics. Hamieh and Katsnelson showed that oscillations of the entanglement wave have the same periodicity, but out of phase, with the oscillation of the ͑nonequilibrium͒ average magnetization. The distribution of entanglement in the chain has been analyzed after launching a single excitation from the central site of a XX chain by Fitzsimons and Twamley ͑2005͒ It was found that the second-order moment of the spatial extent of the concurrence grows much faster ͑with a rate increasing as t5/2͒ if some disorder is present in the central portion of the chain ͑in the ordered case the increase goes as t2͒.
Additional features emerge in the quantum XY with ␥ 0. In this case the magnetization is no longer a constant of motion ͑two spins can be ﬂipped simulta-

At short times t ഛ 1.8 the dynamical phase transition is a point of reentrance for the entanglement. At later times the state remains separable for values of the ﬁeld above the critical value.

neously͒. Calculations were done analytically ͑Amico et al., 2004͒ resorting to the exact set of out-of-equilibrium correlation functions ͑Amico and Osterloh, 2004͒. The most notable difference in the two-site entanglement studied is an entanglement production from the vacuum. This occurs uniformly along the chain and it superimposes to the associated entanglement wave discussed before. The velocity of propagation of the entanglement is almost independent of the anisotropy parameter ␥. What is strongly dependent on ␥ is the damping coefﬁcient of the entanglement wave. As the anisotropy approaches ␥ = 1, the Ising point, the wave is strongly damped and vanishes approximately after a few ϳJ−1. Furthermore, in the anisotropic case it is possible to observe nontrivial dynamics when the external magnetic ﬁeld is time dependent ͓Huang and Kais, 2005; Sen͑De͒ et al., 2005͔. In Sen͑De͒ et al. ͑2005͒ the system is initially prepared in the ground state; the evolution is analyzed after the magnetic ﬁeld is ͑suddenly͒ switched off. Sen͑De͒ et al. analyzed the two-site entanglement by means of the logarithmic negativity as shown in Fig. 27 and demonstrated the existence of a dynamical phase transition, not observable in the magnetization. As it can be seen in Fig. 27 at a ﬁxed time t the entanglement vanishes ͑and then grows again͒ for certain values of the initially applied magnetic ﬁeld. For t ഛ 1.8 the critical ﬁeld is almost independent on the time t and is h ϳ 0.8. A remarkably different situation occurs for t ഛ 1.8, here a dynamical phase transition occurs where the entanglement vanishes for any value of h ജ hc. For values of the initial ﬁeld in the region near the phase transitions, entanglement behaves nonmonotonically with respect to temperature of the initial equilibrium state.

Amico et al.: Entanglement in many-body systems

The two-site entanglement is nonergodic ͓Sen͑De͒ et al., 2004͔. The evolution of two-site entanglement of a
XY chain was studied after a sudden change of the external magnetic ﬁeld. The evolved state does not approach its equilibrium value. That is, entanglement by itself does not relax to its equilibrium value in the absence of further contact with reservoirs. Therefore entanglement in such systems cannot be described by equilibrium statistical mechanics.
The entanglement dynamics has been studied, to a large extent analytically, in the LMG model ͑Vidal, Palacios, and Aslangul, 2004; Latorre, Lütken, et al., 2005͒. They considered the dynamical evolution of entanglement by analyzing both the one-tangle ␶1͑t͒ and the concurrence C͑t͒ for cases in which the initial state is fully
polarized either in the z or in the x direction. Because of the model symmetries and since the initial state belongs
to the sector with maximal spin, S = N / 2, both quantities do not depend on the spins which are selected. This means that they can be expressed in terms of the average value of the total spin ͗S␣͘ and its correlation functions ͗S␣S␤͘ ͑␣ = x , y , z͒. An interesting feature of this model is that its level spacing is ﬁnite even in the thermodynamic limit. Contrary to expectations, however,
the Poincaré time is dependent on the number of spins N and this has important consequences on the entanglement dynamics.
When the spins are prepared in the state ͉0¯0͘ analytical results can be obtained in the limit of zero and very large magnetic ﬁeld. In the limit of zero external ﬁeld the tangle and the concurrence can be expressed as ␶1͑t͒ = 1 − c͑t͒2͑N−1͒ and C͑t͒ = ͑1 / 4͕͒c͑t͒͑N−2͒ − 1 + ͓c͑t͒͑N−2͒ − 1͔2 + ͓4c͑t͒͑N−2͒s͑t͒͑N−2͔͒21/2͖, with c͑t͒ = cos͑4Jt / N͒, s͑t͒ = sin͑4Jt / N͒, and show perfect anticorrelation in time. In the opposite limit of a strong applied ﬁeld it is possible to resort to a semiclassical approximation of the Heisen-
berg equation of motion ͑Law et al., 2001͒, S˙ x = 2hSy, S˙ y = −2hSx + ͑2J / N͓͒Sz , Sx͔+, S˙ y = −͑2J / N͓͒Sz , Sy͔+ by noting that, for N ӷ 1, the z component of the magnetization has negligible ﬂuctuations ͓Sz͑t͒ ϳ S = N / 2͔. Therefore the set of equations governing the dynamics of the system becomes linear and can be easily solved. The concurrence as a function of time for positive values

was also discussed in the context of spin-bosonlike models. Ciancio and Zanardi ͑2006͒ analyzed the negativity for a two-modes Jaynes-Cummings with particular emphasis on the entanglement between two bosonic modes mediated by the qubit. The relaxation dynamics of the entanglement, quantiﬁed through the concurrence, in the spin-boson model was discussed by Lim et al. ͑2006͒.
We ﬁnally mention a study where it was noted that the entanglement encoded in states caused by the splitting of the degeneracy determined by the transverse ﬁeld in
the quantum XY model is not preserved by an adiabatic perturbation. Separable states can become entangled af-

ter the ﬁeld is varied adiabatically, and vice versa ͑Cao et al., 2006͒.

2. Dynamics of the block entropy

The dynamical behavior of the block entropy was ﬁrst

considered by Calabrese and Cardy ͑2005͒ in the general

framework of conformal ﬁeld theory and via an exact

solution of the quantum Ising model. Later Dür et al.

considered Ising models with long range interaction and

De Chiara et al. ͑2005͒ performed numerical simulations

of the XXZ chain.

Calabrese and Cardy showed that a quench of the sys-

tem from a noncritical to a critical point leads the block

entropy ﬁrst to increase linearly in time and then to

saturate. For periodic boundary conditions and given a

block of dimensions ᐉ, the time at which the entropy

saturates is given by t* = ᐉ / ͑2v͒, where v is the spin wave

velocity:

ͭ ͮ t, t ഛ t*
Sᐉ͑t͒ ϳ ᐉ, t ജ t*.

͑74͒

Thus there is an arbitrary large entanglement entropy in the asymptotic state, contrary to the ground-state case where the entropy diverges only at critical point. An example of the block entropy time dependence for the
Ising and XXZ models is shown in Fig. 28. Calabrese and Cardy proposed a simple interpretation for this behavior in terms of quasiparticles excitations emitted
from the initial state at t = 0 and freely propagating with
velocity v. The argument goes as follows. The initial state has a high energy relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian which governs the subsequent time evolution, and therefore acts as a source of quasiparticle excitations. Particles emitted from different points are incoherent, but pairs of particles moving to the left or right from a given point are highly entangled ͑see Fig. 29͒. The idea is that a point xA in the region A will be entangled with a point xB in the region B if a pair of entangled particles emitted at an earlier time arrive si-
multaneously at xA and xB. In this picture the block entropy is proportional to the length of the interval where this occurs. Saturation is reached when the most distant quasiparticles ͑which started in the middle of the block͒ have already got entangled. In the presence of disorder the dynamical behavior is strikingly different. This picture applies in the more general context of dynamical correlation functions after a quench as discussed by Calabrese and Cardy ͑2006͒.
Possible evidence of localization in the block entropy has been discussed by De Chiara et al. ͑2005͒. The case of Ising models in zero magnetic ﬁeld with long range interaction of the dynamics was analyzed in the case of factorized initial states ͑Dür et al., 2005͒. The general picture is also conﬁrmed in this case although in the short time limit additional oscillations appear probably due to the various different phases related to the different couplings.
We ﬁnally mention that the entropy in the case of a ﬁnite time quench has been considered by Cherng and

3. Chaos and dynamics of entanglement
The evolution of entanglement is sensitive to the different properties of the spectrum in the transition to chaos as in the case of a quantum computer with imperfections. A small inaccuracy in the coupling constants induces errors in gating or a unwanted time evolution if the Hamiltonian cannot be switched exactly to zero. If the imperfection strength increases, new phenomena occur and above a certain threshold the core of the computer can even “melt” due to the setting in of chaotic behavior ͑Georgeot and Shepelyansky 2000; Benenti et al., 2001͒. In addition to understanding the behavior of the ﬁdelity as an indicator to measure the stability of the quantum memory ͓see Gorin et al. ͑2006͒ for a review͔, a more complete characterization has included the behavior of entanglement on approaching the transition to chaos either by considering dynamics of a disordered ͓Montangero and Viola, 2006; Montangero et al., 2006; Sen ͑De͒ et al., 2006͔ or time-dependent Ising model

In particular the disordered Ising model has been proposed ͑Georgeot and Shepelyansky, 2000͒ to describe the hardware of a quantum computer, in which system imperfections generate unwanted interqubit couplings and energy ﬂuctuations. Three different regimes appear depending on the variance of the ﬂuctuations of the exchange couplings. At the critical value ␦Jc the system crosses from the perturbative to the chaotic regime, while at the second point ␦JE the system goes into an ergodic state characterized by a Gaussian local density of states. All these dynamical regimes have been detected in the dynamics of entanglement by Montangero et al. ͑2003͒ and Montangero and Viola ͑2006͒.
We ﬁnally mention the interesting connections ͑Boness et al., 2006͒ found for the properties of the entanglement in a Heisenberg chain with pulsed magnetic ﬁeld with the localization behavior of the quantum kicked rotator.

B. Generation of entanglement

The Hamiltonians discussed so far can be also used to

generate particular entangled states. The simplest case

to consider is the XX model in the sector in which only

one spin is ﬂipped. The fact that the Hilbert space is

spanned by the basis set ͉ഞ͘ hints to the fact that

W-states can be generated. For short chains, N = 3 , 4,

number of qubits. The reason is related to the fact that

for generic terms the various frequencies appearing in

the dynamical evolution of the state are not commensu-

rate.

An interesting example of entangled state generation

is that of cluster states ͑Briegel and Raussendorf, 2001͒

which has been shown to be essential for one-way quan-

tum computation ͑Raussendorf and Briegel, 2001; Raus-

sendorf et al., 2003͒ ͓see Hein et al. ͑2006͒ for a review͔.

Remarkably, they can be generated by certain spin

Hamiltonians. In fact, the dynamical evolution of an

Ising model in zero magnetic ﬁeld, H = ͚i,jJij␴iz␴jz, is equivalent to a series of conditional phase shifts. In the

case of a regular lattice this Hamiltonian generates clus-

ter states which are readily generalized to graph states

for an Ising model deﬁned on a simple graph. It is easy

to realize that the evolution operator at time Jt = ␲ / 4 can

be

written

as

If

state

is

a product state with all spins pointing along the x direc-

tion, then at time Jt = ␲ / 4 the state is a graph state char-

acterized by a maximal bipartite entanglement and

maximal entanglement persistence. An example of a

cluster state generated by an Ising chain with nearest-

neighbor couplings, for N = 4, is given by ͉⌿͘cl= ͉0000͘ + ͉1100͘ + ͉0011͘ − ͉1111͘ ͑for N = 2 , 3 cluster states coin-

cide with Bell and GHZ states, respectively͒. The Ising

model is not the only case when graph states can be

created. Borhani and Loss ͑2005͒ showed how to gener-

ate them using the Heisenberg interaction while Clark et

al. ͑2005͒ considered the XX-model Hamiltonian.

An appropriate tailoring of the initial state or the spin

graph can lead to production of properly tailored en-

tangled states ͑Koniorczyk et al., 2005͒. In an XX model

in a star network it is possible to control the concurrence

between two spins by varying the initial state of the cen-

tral spin only. Such a spin mediates the interaction be-

tween the outer ones as discussed by Hutton and Bose

͑2004͒. The pairwise entanglement can be maximized by

choosing all outer spins down and the central spin up.

These dynamically generated states saturate the

Coffman-Kundu-Wootters ͑CKW͒ inequality, Eq. ͑8͒

͑Coffman et al., 2000͒ and hence have the maximal pos-

sible two-site entanglement. Koniorczyk et al. analyzed

the concurrence of assistance, i.e., the maximum amount

of entanglement which could be concentrated on two

qubits by means of assisted measurements on the rest of

the system. Depending on the initial system, the behav-

ior of the concurrence and concurrence of assistance can

be quite different.

C. Extraction of entanglement
The entanglement naturally contained in a many-body state can in principle be extracted and therefore used for quantum information processing. This means that such entanglement can be transferred to a pair of particles and subsequently used, in principle, for quantum computation or to test the violation of Bell’s inequalities. De Chiara et al. proposed a scheme of entanglement swap-

ping by scattering a pair of particles with a spin chain or an optical lattice ͑De Chiara et al., 2006͒. To this end one sends simultaneously a pair of probe particles toward the entangled spin chain in such a way that each probe interacts with a different spin. The entanglement between probes has been extracted from the spin chain and cannot exist without entanglement in the chain. This is a genuine nonlocal process between two probes as in the case of entanglement swapping. In practice the scattering interaction between probes and spins in the chain must be capable of ͑at least partially͒ swapping their state. This is the case of very common interactions like
the Heisenberg or the XY ones. The most natural way to extract entanglement from entangled electron spins in solids would be to scatter pairs of neutrons off the solid. Another possibility would be to use Hamiltonians of entangled spin chains or ladders that can be realized using trapped cold atoms ͑Duan et al., 2003; Garcia-Ripoll et al., 2003; Garcia-Ripoll and Cirac, 2004͒ and as probe particles one can use marker qubits ͑Calarco et al., 2004͒.

D. Time evolution of the entanglement in Gaussian states
The dynamics of Gaussian states was ﬁrst discussed by Plenio et al. ͑2004͒, where essentially two aspects have been highlighted: The creation of entanglement from an initially disentangled state and the propagation of an entangled state on top of a disentangled background, both induced by Hamiltonian dynamics.
The initially entangled two-mode state is characterized by the squeezing parameter r, which appears in the co-variance matrix as V␰␣,␰␣ = cosh r for all phase space variables of the zeroth and ﬁrst oscillator modes, whereas Vq0,q1 = Vp0,p1 = sinh r; in absence of further offdiagonal elements, all other diagonal elements are equal to 1. Two different types of nearest-neighbor couplings of the oscillator have been considered: ideal springs obeying Hooke’s law and the rotating wave approximation ͑RWA͒. In this approximation both the kinetic and potential energy terms assume the same form ͑Plenio et al., 2004͒. The RWA conserves the number of bosonic excitations in the system, whereas the ideal spring coupling does not. The initial entanglement is encoded in a zeroth oscillator, itself decoupled from the chain of oscillators, and one oscillator within the chain as described above. In this case, the Hamiltonian for the harmonic lattice ͓with an appropriate choice of the matrix U, see Eq. ͑34͔͒ reads

After discarding the terms aˆ aˆ and aˆ †aˆ †, in RWA, Eq. ͑75͒ can be written ͑up to a constant͒ as ͑Plenio et al., 2004͒

͑76͒

For both Eqs. ͑75͒ and ͑76͒ the time evolution of the

position and momentum operator can be evaluated ana-

lytically.

The initially entangled state of two oscillators—a de-

coupled and one harmonic oscillator within a periodic

chain—is released at time t = 0 into the background of

initially disentangled oscillators, all prepared in their

ground state. In regard to the pairwise entanglement we

observe that the nth and zeroth oscillators become en-

tangled after a ﬁnite time tc͑n͒, which is given by the velocity of sound of the underlying model Hamiltonian.

After this entanglement wave arrives, the nth oscillators’

entanglement exhibits damped oscillations with the

characteristic time scale of the model. For the model

͑75͒, the velocity of sound has been determined as v
= K1 / ͱ1 + 2K1. Within the RWA this velocity appears en-
hanced: vRWA= K1. The height ENf of the ﬁrst local maximum in the logarithmic negativity has been used to

deﬁne the transmission efﬁciency Teff for entanglement in the chain as Teff= ENf / ENi, where ENi is the logarithmic negativity initially prepared between the oscillators

zero and one.

In both models ENf is observed to saturate when cranking up r and hence the initial entanglement. As

expected, the saturation value is a decreasing function of

the distance n. The main difference is that for generic

coupling the saturation value depends on the coupling

strength K1 and the smaller it is, the stronger the coupling is. Within the RWA it is independent of the cou-

pling strength. Given the initial logarithmic negativity

ENi = −2r / ln 2, the transmission efﬁciency behaves differently. For the generic model it is zero for zero squeezing,

has a maximum at a ﬁnite squeezing rmax, and vanishes for r → ϱ. In sharp contrast, in RWA Teff is a monotoni-
cally decreasing function of r. Interestingly enough, for

the model in RWA, the oscillator frequencies and cou-

pling strengths can be optimized to have perfect trans-

mission from one end of an open chain of M sites to

the other end. This is achieved by

= −

KUj1+ͱ1,͑jn=−K11͒ͱ͑nn¯͑+M1−͒,

n͒, Uj,j= 1, where n¯ = M

−

and n. The

virtue ␻n =
same

1 o−fK1Uͱj,nj+n¯1
turns out

to be impossible for the generic model and M Ͼ 2. The

only possibility is to choose the couplings and frequen-

cies as in the RWA case in the limit of K1 → 0 ͑where the RWA is exact͒. In this way, the transmission efﬁciency

can be pushed arbitrarily close to perfect transmission

but with a transmission speed tending to zero. The trans-

mission of quantum information has been found to be

robust against noise in K1 for both models ͑Plenio et al., 2004͒.

Another effect occurring in the generic model is en-

tanglement creation from a disentangled state, which is

not an eigenstate. This can be realized by an abrupt

change of the coupling strength. As in the spin case ͑see

Sec. IX.A͒ no entanglement creation can be generated within the RWA. In an open chain the oscillators at the end points become entangled after half the time a signal needs to travel through the entire chain. This indicates that this initial pairwise entanglement is mediated from the center of the chain. Actually this is the ﬁrst signal that can possibly arrive when essentially pairwise entanglement is created or contributes to the eventual pairwise entanglement of the boundary oscillators. Raising a ﬁnite temperature for a thermal state, the arrival time is slightly enhanced and the signal is subject to damping. However, this effect turned out to be much more sensitive to noise in the coupling strength than the propagation of quantum information ͑Plenio et al., 2004͒.
X. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
During the last years it became evident that quantum information offers powerful instruments to grasp the properties of complex many-body systems. This is the reason why this area of research is undergoing an impressive expansion. In this review we touched only one particular aspect of this activity, namely the properties of entanglement in many-body systems.
As mentioned in the Introduction, there are several important aspects which, for space limitations, were ignored. In this respect we should certainly mention the increasing interest towards the optimization of numerical simulations of quantum systems. There were already a number of breakthroughs ͑see also the Introduction͒ that, for example, lead to the development of the timedependent DMRG. The design of variational methods to study the ground state and ﬁnite temperature properties of many-body Hamiltonians has been exploited in numerous work. We mentioned in the Introduction the large body of activity on quantum state transfer in spin chains. Here the knowledge of low-lying excitations of the chain ͑spin waves͒ has helped in ﬁnding new quantum protocols. More is expected to come in the future.
It is tempting, although difﬁcult, to try to envisage the possible evolution of this line of research. The study of the topological entanglement entropy is an important aspect that will be investigated in the future. Adiabatic quantum computation and one-way quantum computation will beneﬁt from the study of entanglement in complex systems. The study of the topological entanglement may also have remarkable spin off to understand many puzzling phenomena in condensed matter physics among which high-Tc superconductors and heavy fermions are of paramount importance ͑Coleman and Schoﬁeld, 2005͒. Furthermore, analysis of new measures for multipartite entanglement may provide the additional insight necessary for understanding the role of entanglement in such complex phenomena, which might also reveal valuable information, e.g., on how to simulate these systems efﬁciently on a computer.
Many interesting results have been already obtained, but the overlap between quantum information and many-body physics is not yet fully unveiled. There is a

number of open questions which provide a fertile ground for a ﬁeld of lively exciting research.
