ABSTRACT: Rechargeable lithium metal batteries are considered the “Holy Grail” of energy storage systems. Unfortunately, uncontrollable dendritic lithium growth inherent in these batteries (upon repeated charge/discharge cycling) has prevented their practical application over the past 40 years. We show a novel mechanism that can fundamentally alter dendrite formation. At low concentrations, selected cations (such as cesium or rubidium ions) exhibit an eﬀective reduction potential below the standard reduction potential of lithium ions. During lithium deposition, these additive cations form a positively charged electrostatic shield around the initial growth tip of the protuberances without reduction and deposition of the additives. This forces further deposition of lithium to adjacent regions of the anode and eliminates dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries. This strategy may also prevent dendrite growth in lithium-ion batteries as well as other metal batteries and transform the surface uniformity of coatings deposited in many general electrodeposition processes.

■ INTRODUCTION
Lithium (Li) metal has an extremely high theoretical speciﬁc capacity (3860 mAh g−1), low density (0.59 g cm−3), and the lowest negative electrochemical potential (−3.040 V vs
standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)); thus rechargeable Li metal batteries have been called the “Holy Grail” of energy
storage systems and have been investigated extensively during the last 40 years.1−5 The Li metal anode has also been widely used in the investigation of “next generation” rechargeable batteries, such as Li-sulfur batteries6,7 and Li-air batteries.8,9
However, two major problems, Li dendrite growth and low Coulombic eﬃciency during repeated charging and discharging, hinder commercial application of Li metal-based cells.5,6,10,11 Although the Coulombic eﬃciency problem can be compensated by using excess Li metal, without signiﬁcantly compromising the energy density of the batteries,2 Li dendrite
growth during long-term cycling often leads to short circuits
and sometimes even catastrophic failure. In the last 40 years, Li dendrite formation has been widely observed,5,10−14 analyzed,15−17 and simulated.18−20 Most approaches to dendrite
prevention focus on improving the stability and uniformity of
the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer by adding SEI formation additives.11,12,20−29 However, the additives used in these studies are consumed as part of the SEI ﬁlms so they are ineﬀective in suppressing Li dendrite during long-term

operation. As indicated by Aurbach,11 it is very diﬃcult to achieve suﬃcient passivation with Li electrodes and liquid solutions. The approach to form alloys with Li metal during deposition process has also been reported, which is achieved by adding inorganic compounds or second salts into the electrolytes.30−33 However, due to the consumption of such metal cation additives by forming alloys during Li deposition, the suppression to Li dendrite formation is not sustainable. As an alternative, various mechanical barriers have been proposed to block dendrite growth.18,34,35 Most of these approaches rely on a strong mechanical barrier (SEI ﬁlm or separator) to suppress the Li dendrite growth but do not change the fundamental, self-ampliﬁcation behavior of the dendrite growth. A general solution to the dendrite growth problem will not only enable a series of Li metal-based energy storage systems, but also beneﬁt general electrodeposition processes widely used in industry.
We propose and demonstrate a novel mechanism, which can fundamentally alter dendrite formation in electrochemically deposited lithium ﬁlms. Fundamental principles behind this mechanism will be analyzed. Various characterization and modeling tools have been used to analyze the morphology of

the deposited lithium ﬁlms and simulate their formation
process. The details of these analysis and long-term test results
of Li metal batteries will be reported in this work.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials and Li Deposition. LiPF6, propylene carbonate (PC), and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) were purchased from Novolyte in
battery grade. KPF6 (99.9%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. CsI (99.999%), RbI (99.9%), and AgPF6 (98%) were ordered from SigmaAldrich. CsPF6 and RbPF6 were synthesized by mixing stoichiometric amounts of AgPF6 and the related iodide salt in PC solution inside a glovebox (MBraun) ﬁlled with puriﬁed argon where the oxygen and moisture content was less than 1 ppm, followed by ﬁltration of the formed AgI from the solution using 0.45 μm syringe ﬁlters. LiPF6 was then added into the CsPF6−PC or RbPF6−PC solutions to get the electrolytes.
Li was deposited on copper (Cu) foil substrates (10 mm × 10 mm) in diﬀerent electrolyte solutions at the desired current densities inside the argon-ﬁlled glovebox using a Solartron electrochemical interface
(SI 1287). After deposition, the electrode was washed with DMC to
remove the residual electrolyte and dried in the antechamber of the
glovebox under vacuum prior to characterization and analyses. Characterization. The surface morphologies of the deposited
lithium (Li) electrodes were measured by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL 5900 scanning electron microscope
at a working distance of 12 mm and an accelerating voltage of 20 keV.
Meanwhile, the surface element components were determined by means of energy dispersive X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometer (EDX)
(JEOL 2010). To avoid air contamination, the Li electrode samples
were transferred in the Sample-Saver Storage Container (South Bay Technology, Inc., U.S.) ﬁlled with puriﬁed argon and loaded into the
SEM machine in a glovebag purged with pure argon.
The compositions of the SEI layers formed on the surfaces of deposited Li ﬁlms were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). XPS measurements of the Li samples were performed with a
Physical Electronics Quantera scanning X-ray microprobe with a focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (1486.7 eV) source for excitation
and a spherical section analyzer. The samples were mounted onto the
standard sample holder inside a nitrogen recirculated glovebox operated at <0.2 ppm O2 and a dew point of −80 °C.
The composition of each element in the deposited ﬁlms was
determined by inductively coupled plasma/atomic emission spectrom-
etry (ICP/AES, Optima 7300DV, Perkin-Elmer) techniques after
appropriate dilution. Three emission lines were chosen for each
element as a cross-check for spectral interference. The calibration
standards were matrix-matched in water. Battery Performance Test. To prepare the Li electrodes for
morphology study after long-term cycling with diﬀerent electrolytes, Li|Li4Ti5O12 coin cells of CR2032 type were used. The Li4Ti5O12 electrode was prepared by coating a slurry of Li4Ti5O12, Super P conductive carbon, and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF) (8:1:1 by
weight) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) onto a copper foil, evaporating the NMP solvent, and drying at about 80 °C under vacuum overnight. The cells were assembled inside the argon-ﬁlled glovebox with a Li4Ti5O12 electrode, a glass ﬁber separator (500 μm thick, Whatman GF-B), a Li foil (0.75 mm thick), and 200 μL of
electrolyte. They then were charged (Li deposition) and discharged
(Li dissolution) between 2.5 and 1.0 V on an Arbin battery testing
system (BT2000). After 100 cycles, Li anodes were taken out of the
cells and washed with anhydrous dimethyl carbonate DMC for SEM
observations. Modeling and Simulations. To simulate Li deposition process in
electrolytes with PC solvent and diﬀerent salts (either LiPF6 or LiPF6/ CsPF6 mixture), a mesoscopic model was developed. In this model, ions were considered as spheres with the radii equal to the
corresponding ionic radii. The positive and negative ions interact
with each other via Coulomb force, excluded volume, and ion
correlation interactions evaluated analytically within the classical Density Functional Theory approach.37,38 Li ions that came in direct

contact with the electrode surface were considered deposited on the electrode, and therefore changed the shape of the electrode surface. This, in turn, led to the change in the electrostatic potential from the electrode. To account for this eﬀect, Laplace equation with the boundary conditions corresponding to the new shape of the electrode was solved. The equilibrium distribution of ions was then evaluated in the electrostatic ﬁeld of the modiﬁed electrode. Simulations were repeated for 24 steps of Li deposition and performed at 298 K.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Self-Healing Electrostatic Shield (SHES) Mechanism. We propose a self-healing electrostatic shield (SHES) mechanism that can fundamentally change the Li deposition morphology. It leads to a “self-healing” as opposed to “selfampliﬁcation” of the initial protuberant tips that unavoidably occur during the Li deposition process. This mechanism depends on an electrolyte additive cation that has an eﬀective reduction potential lower than that of Li ion.
Figure 1 illustrates how the SHES mechanism can self-heal Li growth tips. During the initial stage of deposition, both Li ions

(Li+) and the cations of the non-Li additive (M+) are adsorbed on the Li substrate surface (Figure 1a) under an applied voltage (Va) slightly lower than the Li reduction potential (ELi/Li+) but higher than the additive reduction potential (EM/M+); that is, ELi/Li+ > Va > EM/M+, Li will be deposited on the substrate and unavoidably form some protuberant tips due to various ﬂuctuations in the system (Figure 1b). It is well-known that a sharp edge or protrusion on the electrode exhibits a stronger electrical ﬁeld, so more Li will be preferentially deposited around the tips rather than on smooth regions of the anode. In a conventional electrolyte, ampliﬁcation of this behavior will form Li dendrites as reported previously.10 However, the adsorbed additive cations (M+) with a reduction potential lower

than Va (Figure 1c) will not electroplate on the tip. Instead, they will accumulate in the vicinity of the tip to form an
electrostatic shield (Figure 1d). This positively charged shield will repel incoming Li+ from the protrusion forcing further Li+
deposition to adjacent regions of the anode (Figure 1e) until a
smooth deposition layer is formed (Figure 1f). The process
repeats with formation of additional growth tips. This selfhealing mechanism can eﬀectively disrupt the conventional dendrite ampliﬁcation mechanism and lead to the deposition of a smooth Li ﬁlm.
The SHES mechanism depends on an additive cation (M+) that exhibits an eﬀective reduction potential Ered less than that of Li+. According to the Nernst equation:

= 1). When the concentration of cations of cesium (Cs+) or rubidium (Rb+) is less than 0.05 M in the electrolyte, their eﬀective reduction potentials (see the shaded cells in Table 1) are lower than that of Li+ at 1.0 M concentration (−3.040 V). As a result, in a mixed electrolyte where the additive (Cs+ or Rb+) concentration is much lower than the Li+ concentration,
these additives should not be deposited at the Li deposition
potential and do not form thin layers of Li alloys at the
electrode surface. In contrast, the inorganic additives (including Mg2+, Al3+, Zn2+, Ga3+, In3+, and Sn2+) used in the previous studies30,31 do not have an eﬀective reduction potential lower than that of Li+ even though the concentrations of these additives are much lower than those of Li+ (see Table S1 in the
Supporting Information). Therefore, the proposed SHES

mechanism cannot be applied to the conventional inorganic additives. Instead, as indicated by Matsuda et al.,31 these
inorganic ions form thin layers of Li alloys at the electrode surface during cathodic deposition of Li, and the resulting ﬁlms
suppress the dendritic deposition of Li. These additive metal
ions will be consumed during each deposition, and their eﬀectiveness will fade soon with increasing cycles.
In addition to a low concentration (cx) of the additive, an activity coeﬃcient (γx) of the additives lower than those of the Li+ would also reduce the chemical activity of the cations and further lead to an eﬀective reduction potential lower than that of Li+. In addition, a cation that has a much lower solvation number than those of Li+ in the given solvent will be highly eﬃcient to form the required electrostatic shield.
Dendrite-Free Li Films Deposited with SHES Addi-
tives. The proposed SHES mechanism has been successfully veriﬁed experimentally. The eﬀect of CsPF6 concentration in the electrolyte on the prevention of Li dendrite formation and
growth was then investigated. 1 M LiPF6 in PC was used as the control electrolyte. The maximum concentration of CsPF6 in the control electrolyte is approximately 0.055 M as determined from ICP/AES analysis; therefore, the eﬀect of Cs+ concentration on the ﬁnal morphologies of deposited Li ﬁlms was tested up to 0.05 M. SEM images of the deposited Li ﬁlms
on copper substrates are shown in Figure 2. Conventional Li dendritic formation is clearly observed in the Li ﬁlm deposited
in the control electrolyte without the CsPF6 additive (Figure 2a). For the Li ﬁlms deposited in electrolytes containing the Cs+ additive, ﬁlm topography decreases with increasing Cs+ concentration. Even at very low Cs+ concentrations (0.001 and
0.005 M), dendrite formation is substantially decreased (Figure 2b and c, respectively). Further increase in the Cs+
concentration to 0.01 and 0.05 M results in a very distinctive
improvement in anode surface quality with complete
elimination of dendrite formation (Figure 2d and e). As the SHES mechanism predicts, Cs+ cations can eﬀectively prevent Li dendrite growth. More speciﬁcally, the Li deposition ﬁlm resulting from the 0.05 M Cs+ electrolyte becomes mirror-like
to the naked eye. These results indicate that, to form an eﬀective electrostatic shield that prevents Li dendrite growth, the additive cations not only need to have an eﬀective reduction potential very close to that of Li+ in the given electrolyte, but also need to have suﬃciently high concentration to form the
electrostatic shield. Therefore, a concentration of 0.05 M CsPF6 in the control electrolyte was used in subsequent experiments. In addition to Cs+, Rb+ was also eﬀective in preventing Li dendrite growth as the SHES mechanism predicts. A very ﬁne
surface morphology without dendrite formation has been
observed for 0.05 M RbPF6 in the electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6/PC (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
Further testing showed the SHES mechanism can also be
used to eliminate pre-existing dendrites formed on electrodes. A highly dendritic Li ﬁlm (see Figure 3a) was intentionally
deposited on a copper substrate in a control electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in PC for 1 h, then transferred into a Cs+-containing electrolyte (0.05 M CsPF6 in 1 M LiPF6/PC), and deposition continued for an additional 14 h. Unlike the dendritic and mossy ﬁlm deposited in the control electrolyte for the same length of time (see Figure 2a), a smooth Li ﬁlm was obtained as
shown in Figure 3b. The open spaces shown in Figure 3a have been ﬁlled by dense Li deposition, and all of the original
needle-like dendritic whiskers have been transformed into
much smaller spherical particles, which are also eliminated

upon further Li deposition. We observed that all ﬁlms deposited using SHES additives consisted of many small

spherical particles. This is in strong contrast with the needle-
like dendrites grown from a conventional electrolyte and clearly
validates that the SHES mechanism has fundamentally changed
the dynamic behavior of Li deposition. In addition to the static SEM images of the deposited ﬁlms,
two distinguished lithium growth patterns were also directly
observed and recorded by video camera attached to a
microscope (see method 2.1 and Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information). Movies S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information
were taken during lithium deposition processes without and with 0.05 M Cs+ additive in the control electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in PC), respectively. The deposition lasts for 5 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2. For the lithium ﬁlm deposited without
the additive, conventional dendritic growth is clearly observed. In contrast, when the lithium ﬁlm was deposited in the electrolyte with 0.05 M Cs+, the deposited lithium ﬁlm exhibits
a densely packed structure. These dramatic changes demon-
strate that the SHES mechanism fundamentally changes the dynamics of lithium ﬁlm growth from a self-ampliﬁcation/
disordered process to a self-healing/ordered process. Sustainable Operation of SHES Mechanism. A critical
feature of the SHES mechanism is that the adsorbed additive
cations not be reduced nor incorporated into the Li surface during deposition. This feature is markedly diﬀerent from previous approaches3,28,32,33 where additives are reduced during the deposition process and “sacriﬁced or consumed” as part of the SEI ﬁlm or an alloy to suppress Li dendrite growth.28,31,36
As a result, the additive concentration in the electrolyte will
decrease with an increasing number of charge/discharge cycles, and the eﬀectiveness quickly degrades. In contrast, the cations
used in the SHES mechanism form an electrostatic shield or “cloud” when dendritic tips initiate, which dissipates once the
applied voltage is removed, thus eliminating loss of the additive upon repeated cycling. To verify this prediction, Li ﬁlms
(containing a SEI surface layer) deposited in electrolytes containing 0.05 M Cs+, and 0.05 M Rb+ additives, were
analyzed by XPS, EDX, and ICP/AES . Within the instrument

detection limits, the test results show no evidence of Cs or Rb in the deposited Li ﬁlms (including the SEI surface layers) (see Figures S2 and S3 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information for XPS, EDX, and ICP/AES analysis results, respectively).
The SHES eﬀect was also examined in rechargeable Li metal batteries. Coin cells of the Li|Li4Ti5O12 battery system were assembled using the electrolytes with and without 0.05 M Cs+ additive. Figure 4 compares the morphologies of Li metal

anodes after 100 charge/discharge cycles. The Li electrode in the cell without additive (see Figure 4a) exhibits clear dendritic growth behavior, but no dendritic Li was observed in the cell with additives (see Figure 4b). These cells demonstrated excellent long-term cycling stability (only 4% capacity fade in 660 cycles when charged/discharged at 1 C rate) as shown in Figure 5. Charge/discharge voltage proﬁles of the cell are shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information.
It should be noted that the main purpose of the above longterm cycling test is to prove the absence of battery short associated with Li dendrite growth, which is always encountered during cycling of conventional Li metal batteries when a conventional electrolyte is used. The high Coulombic eﬃciency (99.86%) shown in Figure 5 is associated with Li| Li4Ti5O12 cell, which contain excess amount of Li metal anode. To further evaluate the Columbic eﬃciency of Li deposition, a method proposed by Aurbach et al.39 has been used (see section 2.2 in the Supporting Information for the details of the measurement). The average Coulombic eﬃciency of Li deposition was found to be 76.5% in 1.0 M LiPF6/PC

electrolyte and 76.6% in the electrolyte with addition of 0.05 M CsPF6. The low Coulombic eﬃciency of Li deposition in PCbased electrolytes is mainly due to the poor SEI layer formed
on Li metal surface from the decomposition of PC solvent,
which cannot prevent further reactions between Li metal and
electrolyte components. We also investigated the deposition of Li ﬁlm in several other conventional electrolyte solvents. It is
found that cyclic carbonate solvents (ethylene carbonate, PC, vinylene carbonate, vinyl ethylene carbonate, ﬂuoroethylene
carbonate) lead to smoother and more uniform lithium
deposition than do linear carbonate solvents (dimethyl
carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate). To utilize lithium metal
as an anode in practical rechargeable Li metal batteries, a good
combination of electrolyte solvent, salt, and additives still needs to be identiﬁed so both high Coulombic eﬃciency and
dendrite-free morphology of Li deposition can be realized. Simulation of Li Deposition Based on SHES Mecha-
nism. To further investigate the proposed SHES mechanism,
computational modeling was conducted to simulate Li
deposition from the electrolyte containing 1 M LiPF6 in PC as the main salt and 0.05 M CsPF6 as the additive as described in the Experimental Section. The simulations reveal a sharp
increase in the electrostatic potential at the Li deposition site
(see Figure S4a in the Supporting Information). This leads to
redistribution of cations and anions in the electrolyte solution and at the electrode surface. Li+ and Cs+ accumulate in the high
potential region around a protrusion on the Li metal electrode. Li+ comes in close vicinity to the protrusion and deposits, while Cs+ adsorbs in areas of high opposite charge on the electrode surface, forming a diﬀuse double layer and partially screening the electrostatic potential of the protrusion. This eﬀect is a
direct consequence of stronger electrostatic correlation, or dispersion, interactions between Cs+ ions. Strong dispersion interactions between Cs+ ions induce preferential accumulation of Cs+ at the sites with higher potentials and lead to the
formation of a dense screening layer. Simulations were repeated for 24 steps. The initial Cs+ to Li+
ratio is 1:17 at the surface as opposed to 1:20 in the bulk (see
Figure S4b in the Supporting Information). Because Li deposition decreases its local eﬀective concentration, this
ratio decreases with the growth of the protrusion until it
reaches 1:14, at which point dendrite growth at this site stops due to strong electrostatic screening of the site by Cs+. Moreover, Cs+-induced shielding of Li+ from the protrusion

leads to preferential Li deposition adjacent to the protuberance rather than at the tip, even during initial stages of Li deposition. This results in the growth of islands on the electrode surface in the presence of Cs+ rather than needle-like dendrites, which are energetically favorable in the control electrolyte.
When lithium was deposited in an electrolyte containing 1 M LiPF6 in PC, dendrite growth starts as a narrow pyramid and becomes a two-atom wide column after 24 deposition steps (see movie S3 in the Supporting Information). Li deposition on top of the protrusion is driven by its high electric potential, which induces Li+ accumulation at the tip of the protrusion. In contrast, when lithium was deposited in an electrolyte containing 1 M LiPF6 and 0.05 M CsPF6 additive in PC, weaker electrostatic correlation repulsion between Cs+ ions as compared to that between Li+ ions leads to preferential accumulation of Cs+ in the vicinity of the protrusions causing the electrostatic screening of the high-potential site. Therefore, Li is deposited adjacent to the protrusion, rather than on top of it. This results in a lateral layer-by-layer growth after 24 deposition steps (see movie S4 in the Supporting Information). Snapshots of the simulated Li deposition process without, and with, Cs+ additive after 24 deposition steps are shown in Figure 6a and b, respectively. The protrusion grown in the presence of Cs+ has a blunted, dome shape, while in the control electrolyte, needle-like dendrite growth is observed.

■ CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have demonstrated that the SHES mechanism fundamentally changes the morphology of the deposited Li from needlelike dendrites to mirror-like ﬁlms, or ﬁlms that consist of merged, ﬁne spherical particles. Further, these additives are not consumed during Li deposition and remain eﬀective after longterm cycling of the batteries. The proposed SHES mechanism is fundamentally diﬀerent from previous approaches used to suppress dendritic growth based on (i) mechanical suppression or (ii) additives that are consumed during cycling, but do not eliminate the self-ampliﬁcation growth behavior of the dendrites. This method is not only eﬀective in preventing dendrite growth in Li metal batteries, but preliminary results on Li-ion cells show promise in suppression of metal plating at high overcharge. This approach may also prevent dendritic growth in other rechargeable metal batteries (such as Na-ion, Mg-ion, Zn-air, etc.) and have transformational impact on the surface quality of ﬁlms derived from many electrodeposition processes. Furthermore, the fundamental scientiﬁc principles

that transform a chaotic/dendritic growth pattern to an ordered/spheroidal growth pattern may also explain other naturally occurring phenomena and provide possible guidelines to control heterogeneous nucleation and growth in other ﬁelds.
At last, we need to indicate that, although the SHES mechanism has addressed the dendritic morphology problem encountered during Li deposition, Coulombic eﬃciency of Li deposition in the electrolytes used in this work is still relatively low. A good combination of electrolyte solvent, salt, and additives still needs to be identiﬁed to obtain both dendrite-free morphology and high Coulombic eﬃciency of metal deposition at the same time, which is required for long-term cycling operation of lithium and other metal anode in electrochemical devices.
