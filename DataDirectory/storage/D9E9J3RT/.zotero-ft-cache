Introduction

Lithium (Li) metal is an ideal anode material for rechargeable batteries due to its extremely high theoretical speciﬁc capacity (3860 mAh g−1), the lowest negative electrochemical potential (−3.040 V versus standard hydrogen electrode), and low density (0.534 g cm−3); thus rechargeable Li metal batteries have been investigated
extensively during the last 40 years (Whittingham 2012; Aurbach and Cohen 1996; Xu et al. 2014). Unfortunately, rechargeable batteries based on Li metal anode have
not yet been commercialized. There are two main barriers to the development of Li
metal batteries. One is the growth of Li dendrites during repeated charge/discharge processes, and the other is the low Coulombic efﬁciency (CE) of these processes. These two barriers lead to two critical problems for Li metal anode: internal short circuits caused by dendrites—a safety hazard—and short cycle life of the battery due to reactions between Li metal and electrolyte, consumption of electrolyte,
formation of inactive Li, and continuous increase of cell impedance. Although low CE can be partially compensated by an excess amount of Li—for example, an excess amount of 300 % of Li was a common solution in the early development of Li metal batteries—the dendrite growth-related battery failure, sometimes dramatic failure that led to ﬁre and other hazards, and the emergence of Li-ion batteries have largely diminished industry’s efforts on the development of rechargeable Li metal batteries since the early 1990s. Figure 1.1a, b show the schematic diagram of a
typical Li-ion battery and a Li metal battery, respectively. In Li-ion batteries,
graphite has been widely used as the anode material because Li ions can be intercalated into its layered structure so dendrite growth can be largely prevented. In
Li metal batteries, the cathode shown in Fig. 1.1b can be replaced by sulfur (for a Li–S battery) or air electrode (for a Li-air battery). Figure 1.1c shows the typical morphology of a Li dendrite and the major problems associated with dendrites and
low CE of the Li deposition/stripping processes. With the urgent need for the “next generation” rechargeable batteries, such as
Li–S batteries (Bruce et al. 2012; Ji et al. 2009), Li-air batteries (Girishkumar et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2011), as well as rechargeable Li metal batteries that use other Li

intercalation or Li conversion compounds as the cathode, the use of Li metal anodes has attracted signiﬁcant interests in recent years. Over the last 40 years, Li dendrite formation has been widely analyzed (Aurbach and Cohen 1996; Chianelli 1976; Aurbach et al. 2002; Gireaud et al. 2006; Chandrashekar et al. 2012) and simulated (Monroe and Newman 2005; Tang et al. 2009; Yamaki 1998). Most approaches to dendrite prevention focus on improving the stability and uniformity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on Li surface by adjusting electrolyte components and optimizing SEI formation additives (Aurbach et al. 2002; Gireaud et al. 2006; Ota et al. 2004; Shiraishi et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2007). However, because metallic Li is thermodynamically unstable with organic solvents [as indicated by Aurbach et al. (2002)], it is very difﬁcult to achieve sufﬁcient passivation with a Li electrode in liquid solutions. As an alternative, various mechanical barriers, either ex situ coated polymer layers or inorganic solid-state blocking layers with high shear modulus, have been proposed to block dendrite penetration (Monroe and Newman 2005; Armand et al. 1981; Li et al. 2002; Balsara et al. 2008, 2009; Visco et al. 2004). These approaches rely on a strong mechanical barrier to prevent Li dendrite penetration through separator, but do not change the fundamental, self-amplifying behavior of the dendrite growth. In other words, these methods do not prevent Li dendrites from growing during long-term cycling, or barely improve the CE of Li deposition/stripping, thus they are not suitable for practical rechargeable Li batteries.
Although some factors that can suppress Li dendrite growth may also lead to high CE of Li cycling, in many experimental studies, they are not always directly correlated with each other. Overall, high CE is a more fundamental criterion required for stable cycling of a Li metal anode and the related Li metal batteries. To have a high CE, side reactions between native or freshly deposited Li and electrolyte have to be minimized. These side reactions are proportional to the chemical and electrochemical activity of native Li when it is in direct contact with the surrounding electrolyte. They are also proportional to the surface area of deposited Li. Therefore, a high CE of Li cycling is usually a direct result of low reactivity between freshly deposited Li and electrolyte as well as a low surface area of the deposited Li. On the one hand, a dendritic Li deposition always has a high surface

area. This means that the high CE of Li deposition/stripping is always related to a low surface area Li deposition and a suppressed Li dendrite growth. A stable CE value during long-term cycling also means that an SEI layer formed during Li deposition is relatively stable and very minimal formation of new SEI layers occurs during each cycle. On the other hand, some electrolytes can lead to dendrite-free Li deposition, but exhibit a CE of only less than 80 % (Qian et al. 2015; Ding et al. 2013). This phenomenon often is related to a highly aligned nanoarray of Li structure that has no Li extrusion but still exhibits a high surface area, and freshly deposited Li is highly reactive with the surrounding electrolyte during the cycling process. Therefore, the enhancement of CE is a more fundamental factor controlling long-term, stable cycling of a Li metal anode.
In Chap. 2 of this book, we will ﬁrst review various instruments/tools that are critical for the characterization of Li dendrite growth/stripping processes and analysis on the composition of the surface ﬁlms formed during Li deposition, then we will review the general models of the dendrite growth processes. The effect of the SEI layer on the modeling of Li dendrite growth will also be discussed, which has often been neglected in the literature. In Chap. 3, various factors that affect CE of Li cycling and dendrite growth will be discussed, together with an emphasis on the enhancement of CE. This is partially due to the fact that almost all literature articles report the CE and Li deposition morphology together and a separate description will lead to signiﬁcant duplications. Chapter 4 of the book will discuss the speciﬁc application of Li metal anodes in several key rechargeable Li metal batteries, including Li-air batteries, Li–S batteries, and Li metal batteries using other Li intercalation and Li conversion compounds as cathodes. Finally, a perspective on the future development and application of Li metal batteries will be discussed in Chap. 5.

Chapter 2
Characterization and Modeling of Lithium Dendrite Growth

Dendrites are a common occurrence when electrodepositing metals. Although the term “dendrite” is prevalent throughout the scientiﬁc literature when referencing Li deposition, such structures are atypical (i.e., in general, the plated Li morphology does not consist of regular branched, tree-like structures). Instead, Li tends to plate from solution as particles/nodules or whiskers/needles/ﬁlaments, which can aggregate into more complex constructs. Due to its ubiquitous usage for Li electrochemistry, however, the term “dendrite” will be used throughout the text in this book to refer to the latter structures. It is also notable that the literature that addresses the theory of Li electrodeposition has focused largely on the numerous determinant factors that inﬂuence classical dendritic metal plating, but the evolution of the plated Li structural characteristics is in actuality dictated to a great extent by the concurrent reactions between the reactive Li and electrolyte components (i.e., SEI formation).

2.1 Characterization of Lithium Dendrite Growth

As discussed in Chap. 1, the Li dendrite growth during the Li deposition process is a critical issue for the battery safety. Extensive efforts have been made to characterize and analyze the formation and growth processes of Li dendrites in order to reveal the mechanisms of dendrite formation and growth processes and then ﬁnd the approaches to suppress or prevent the dendrite formation. In the last four decades, many different characterization methods have been used to study Li electrodes and the dendrite formation, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Aurbach et al. 1998; Dollé et al. 2002), optical microscopy (Howlett et al. 2003; Nishikawa et al. 2010; Arakawa et al. 1993), atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Aurbach and Cohen 1997), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Liu et al. 2011; Ghassemi et al. 2011), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Chang et al. 2015), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Morigaki 2002; Aurbach et al. 1987, 1995,

1997; Kanamura et al. 1997), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Ota et al. 2004a; Aurbach et al. 1993; Kanamura et al. 1995b). Both morphology and chemical composition of the deposited Li metal ﬁlms have been extensively investigated. The main approaches used in the characterization of electrochemically deposited Li metal ﬁlms are brieﬂy introduced in this chapter.

2.1.1 Characterization of Surface Morphologies
2.1.1.1 SEM
Among various observation methods, SEM is the most common and useful technique to examine Li electrode surface morphologies. Morphology study focuses on variation of the Li surface and formation of Li dendrites. Since the 1970s, this method has been used to study Li ﬁlm growth (Dey 1976) both ex situ and in situ during dendrite growing/stripping processes (Ding et al. 2013, 2014; Zhamu et al. 2012; Ryou et al. 2012; Stark et al. 2011; Aurbach et al. 1989, 1990a, 1994b; Besenhard et al. 1987; Kanamura et al. 1995a; Yamaki et al. 1998; Shiraishi et al. 1999; Ota et al. 2004a; Gireaud et al. 2006; López et al. 2009; Nazri and Muller 1985b; Yoshimatsu et al. 1988; Choi et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2006; Yoon et al. 2008; Li et al. 2014a; Bieker et al. 2015). With its high resolution images, SEM is a powerful technique to analyze the surface change of Li metal during the deposition and stripping cycles. The effects of solvents (Aurbach et al. 1990a, b; Besenhard et al. 1987; Ota et al. 2004a; Bieker et al. 2015; Naoi et al. 1999), salts (Aurbach et al. 1994; Kanamura et al. 1995a; Yang et al. 2008), additives, (Shiraishi et al. 1999; Fujieda et al. 1994; Osaka et al. 1997b; Ota et al. 2004b; Lee et al. 2007), and other treatments (Stark et al. 2011; Thompson et al. 2011; Stark et al. 2013) have been directly discovered using SEM images. With the help of SEM observations, the correlation between the surface chemistry and morphology of Li electrodes was built (Aurbach et al. 1994), and the morphological transitions on Li metal anodes during cycling were examined (López et al. 2009). In the ex situ SEM studies, the Li samples have been transferred into the SEM instrument chamber in an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction of Li metal with ambient air as described by Kohl and coworkers (Stark et al. 2011). In the in situ SEM observation of Li dendrite formation, Orsini et al. (1998, 1999) ﬁrst reported using in situ SEM to observe the cross section of plastic rechargeable Li batteries using solid polymer electrolytes. They observed the accumulation of mossy Li and growth of dendritic Li at the Li/polymer electrolyte (Fig. 2.1), which was the origin of rapid interface deterioration and capacity fading.
Neudecker et al. (2000) used in situ SEM to observe variation in the behavior of the anode current collector and the overlayer during Li deposition and stripping in an in situ built solid-sate thin-ﬁlm battery. The cross-sectional SEM image of the battery is shown in Fig. 2.2a. During the initial charge of the battery at 4.2 V, Li was plated between the anode current collector (i.e., Cu) and the solid-state

electrolyte (i.e., lithium phosphorous oxynitride or LiPON), and lifted the Cu/LiPON overlayer but did not signiﬁcantly penetrate the Cu ﬁlm (Fig. 2.2b). During discharge to 3.0 V, the plated Li was stripped from the Cu substrate but the inactive Li prevented the exposed edge of the Cu/LiPON overlayer from completely settling onto the LiPON electrolyte again (Fig. 2.2c). Recently, Sagane et al. (2013) also reported use of in situ SEM to observe Li plating and stripping reactions at the LiPON/Cu interface. They found that nucleation reactions are the rate-determining step during the Li plating process, while the Li+ cation diffusivity governs the stripping process.
Nagao et al. (2013) also used in situ SEM to study the Li deposition and dissolution mechanism in a bulk-type solid-state cell with a Li2S-P2S5 solid-state electrolyte (SSE). They reported that at a deposition current density over

1 mA cm−2, the local Li deposition triggered large cracks, resulting in a decrease in the reversibility of Li deposition and dissolution. On the other hand, at a low current density of 0.01 mA cm−2, Li deposition was homogeneous thus greatly reducing the occurrence of unfavorable cracks, which enables reversible deposition and dissolution. These results suggest that homogeneous Li deposition on the surface of the SSE and suppression of the growth of Li metal along the grain boundaries inside the SSE are the keys to achieve the repetitive Li deposition and stripping without deterioration of the SSE. Clearly, SEM (either ex situ or in situ) is a very useful technique to investigate morphology variations of Li electrodes during deposition and stripping in open cells (Li et al. 2014a). However, because of the ultrahigh vacuum condition in SEM tests, most in situ SEM investigations of Li deposition/stripping processes are performed on batteries using solid polymer or inorganic SSE. It is still difﬁcult to conduct an in situ observation of Li formation and growth in conventional liquid electrolytes, which is more relevant to most of practical applications.

2.1.1.2 Optical Microscopy
Optical microscopy is another way to observe the Li dendrites and it has been widely used as an in situ method to observe and record the Li dendrite growing/stripping processes under working conditions close to those of practical applications (Osaka et al. 1997a). Although the resolution of optical microscopy is not as high as that of SEM, it still could easily and instantaneously distinguish the surface change and dendrite formation. It is an intuitional observation on Li electrodes and very helpful to understand a continuous dendrite growing/stripping process. With digital recording devices, the dendrite formation process can be recorded as a video. Therefore, the optical microscopy technique has been widely used to analyze Li electrodes in situ. However, a special optical cell is needed for in situ optical study of Li dendritic growth. Usually, such a cell is homemade as described by Brissot et al. (1998). The optical cell could work as an airtight electrochemical cell, and the Li electrode surface could be observed by optical microscopy. In the in situ observation, optical microscopy is more often used to study the cross section of a Li electrode to observe the dendrite growth perpendicular to the surface of the Li electrode (Stark et al. 2013; Brissot et al. 1998, 1999b; Sano et al. 2011; Howlett et al. 2003; Hernandez-Maya et al. 2015). Figure 2.3 shows typical dendrites formed at different current densities during in situ optical microscopy study. At low current density (0.2 mA cm−2), needle-like and particle-like dendrites are observed, while at higher current densities ( ! 0.7 mA cm−2), dendrites have a tree-like or bush-like shape. Figure 2.4 shows the evolution of Li dendrites observed in the inter-electrode space while the cell is being polarized (at 0.05 mA cm−2). The needle-like dendrite grows on the negative electrode and ﬁnally contacts the positive electrode, causing short circuit of the cell.

2.1.1.3 AFM
AFM is another useful technique to investigate Li electrode morphology. The resolution of AFM is much better than that of optical microscopy. At the same time, AFM can give a three-dimensional (3D) morphology image that is difﬁcult to get

from SEM or optical microscopy. In 1996, Aurbach and Cohen ﬁrst used AFM to study the Li deposition processes in nonaqueous electrolyte systems (Aurbach and Cohen 1996). In that work, the basic electrochemical cell was modiﬁed to hold the highly sensitive electrodes and electrolyte solution and to isolate them from atmospheric contaminants. They found that the AFM scanning is not destructive and does not change the morphology on the surface. After that, more work (Morigaki and Ohta 1998; Aurbach et al. 1999; Cohen et al. 2000; Morigaki 2002; Mogi et al. 2002a, b, c) using in situ AFM was conducted. With the special 3D morphology of AFM images, the swelling and shrinking of Li surfaces during Li deposition and stripping processes have been discovered (Morigaki 2002). Figure 2.5 shows AFM images of a Li surface ﬁlm deposited in a 0.5 M LiAsF6/ propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte, where (a) a bump after Li deposition and (b) shrinkage after consecutive Li stripping are clearly seen (Morigaki 2002). Moreover, investigation by AFM has revealed that the structure of the Li surface consists of grain boundaries, ridge lines, and ﬂat areas (Morigaki and Ohta 1998), which cannot be proven by other morphology test methods including SEM and optical microscopy. Based on these ﬁndings, the breakdown and reparation of the SEI ﬁlms on Li electrodes during Li deposition/stripping cycles have been proposed (Fig. 2.6) and probed (Aurbach and Cohen 1996; Cohen et al. 2000).
Several modiﬁed AFM methods have also been used in the characterization of Li ﬁlm deposition. Shiraishi et al. reported using in situ ﬂuid tapping-mode AFM (TMAFM) coupled with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance to investigate the electrochemical stripping behavior of Li metal in nonaqueous electrolytes containing a small amount of HF (Shiraishi and Kanamura 1998), and also using TMAFM with surface potential microscopy (SPoM) to study the surface condition of the electrodeposited Li on a Ni substrate (Shiraishi et al. 2001). Recently, Zhang et al. (2014) used amplitude-modulated electrostatic force microscopy (AM-EFM) (a special type of AFM) to study the surfaces of deposited Li ﬁlms. The Li ﬁlms

were electrodeposited for 15 h on Cu foils in electrolytes of 1 M LiPF6-PC without and with 0.05 M CsPF6 additive. Li dendrites were formed in the control electrolyte (i.e., without Cs+ additive) and a smooth Li ﬁlm was obtained in the Cs+ containing electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 2.7, the EFM images recorded at a probe voltage of −1 V for the Li ﬁlm formed in the control electrolyte exhibit wide color variations or a strong contrast, which indicates a large ﬂuctuation and nonuniform distribution of electric ﬁeld across the detected Li surface. In comparison, the EFM image for the Li ﬁlm formed in the Cs+-containing electrolyte shows narrow color variations or relatively small contrast, indicating a uniform distribution of the electric ﬁeld across the Li surface and is consistent with a smooth Li ﬁlm.
2.1.1.4 TEM
Due to the success of the application of optical microscopy in the observation of morphologies of deposited Li ﬁlms in microscale, another electron microscopy, i.e., in situ TEM, was recently used to observe in real time the formation of Li ﬁbers or Li dendrite growth at nanoscale (Liu et al. 2011; Ghassemi et al. 2011). Huang and coworkers ﬁrst reported the direct observation of Li ﬁber growth on different nanowire anodes (such as silicon or tin oxide) during in situ charging of nanoscale Li-ion batteries inside a TEM (Huang et al. 2010). Li ﬁbers of up to 35 µm long

The EFM images show the distribution of electric ﬁeld across the Li surface. The wide color variations in the EFM images obtained in the control electrolyte indicate a nonuniform distribution, while the narrow color variations exhibited in the images obtained in Cs+-containing electrolyte indicate a more uniform distribution of electric ﬁeld across the detected Li surface.

grew on nanowire tips along the nanowire axis in an ionic liquid (IL)-based electrolyte. After that, Yassar and coworkers also used this in situ TEM technology to study the growth of Li dendrites (Ghassemi et al. 2011). They reported clear observation of nucleation of Li+ cations at the anode/electrolyte interface and then growth of Li ﬁbers or Li dendrites on the anode surface in a nanoscale Li-ion battery (Fig. 2.8). In situ TEM is a very promising method to observe and study Li dendrite growth in situ during the continuous charging/discharging processes of a battery, especially at the nanoscale.
Although in situ TEM images have been used to reveal the formation and growth of Li dendrites during the continuous charging/discharging processes of a battery, an IL

electrolyte or an SSE has to be used in most in situ TEM studies because the high vapor pressure of a practical liquid electrolyte is not compatible with the high vacuum required by a conventional TEM system. It is well known that an SEI layer formed on the surface of a Li ﬁlm or dendrite is critical for Li deposition/stripping. However, the SEI formed in IL or SSE is greatly different from those formed in the conventional electrolytes used in Li metal batteries. Therefore, the interaction between Li dendrites and a practical liquid electrolyte still cannot be observed in these in situ TEM studies. Very recently, with the development of liquid cells for in situ TEM techniques, a true operando TEM investigation on Li dendrite growth has been performed in electrochemical cells with conventional liquid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries (Gu et al. 2013; Mehdi et al. 2014, 2015; Sacci et al. 2014). Sacci et al. (2014) reported the direct visualization of an initial dendritic SEI formation prior to Li deposition, and this dendritic morphology remained on the surface after Li dissolution during the in situ electrochemical TEM study, which used 1.2 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/ dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (3:7 by wt) as electrolyte. Mehdi et al. (2015) used in situ electrochemical scanning TEM (STEM) to study the initial stages of SEI formation and Li dendrite evolution at the anode/electrolyte interface during Li deposition/stripping processes in 1 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte. The high-angle annular dark ﬁeld (HAADF) STEM images of the anode/electrolyte interface during the ﬁrst three charge-discharge cycles of this operando Li battery are shown in Fig. 2.9. The deposition and stripping of Li is clearly observed. Some electrochemically inactive or “dead” Li residues around the electrode after Li stripping for all the three cycles are present, which are no longer attached to the Pt electrode.
Presently, the liquid cell TEM gives relatively lower resolution images than the open cell (i.e., vacuum conditioned) TEM does due to the limitation of cell thickness required to hold liquid electrolyte. Therefore, future improvement is required on the liquid cell fabrication (including electrodes with different alloying performance and control of the thickness) along with use of faster imaging methods. Such improvements should enable the clear observations of the initial stages of different mechanisms to be quantiﬁed on the nanometer to atomic scale. When

The formation of the SEI layer (ring of contrast around the electrode), alloy formation due to Li+ ion insertion, and the presence of “dead Li” detached from the electrode can all be seen in the images at the end of the cycle, thereby demonstrating the degree of irreversibility associated with this process.

coupled with different electrolyte compositions (i.e., solvents, salts, and additives), the improved liquid cell TEM technology may provide critical insights into the complex interfacial reactions for future Li-based and other next-generation energy storage systems.
2.1.1.5 NMR
NMR is a powerful tool for detecting chemical bonds or atomic surroundings. Recently, Bhattacharyya and Grey et al. proposed using the difference between NMR signal intensities of bulk and porous Li to identify the Li dendrite growth (Bhattacharyya et al. 2010). They have successfully used this method as an in situ tool to quantitatively observe the formation of Li dendrites in different electrolytes. Chandrashekar et al. (2012) reported using 7Li magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to detect in situ the variation of Li electrode morphologies during charge and discharge processes of a symmetric Li metal cell. The 7Li NMR spectra of the Li metal resonance before (pristine) and after applying a current (charged) indicated that the area of the spectrum in the charged state was 2.3 times larger than that in the pristine state. This increase could be attributed to the formation of

dendritic, mossy, and other microstructural metallic Li during charging. The two-dimensional 7Li MRI images before and after the cell charging are depicted in Figs. 2.10a, b, where the cumulative signals were projected along the z direction which is perpendicular to the substrate. The MRI image of the charged battery revealed the negative electrode had a signiﬁcant increase in signal of almost double, while the positive electrode showed a decrease in signal of about 23 % after charging. It indicated the location and change of microstructural Li morphology, which is consistent with ﬁndings from SEM images (Figs. 2.10c, d). Recently, Arai et al. (2015) used in situ solid-state 7Li NMR to observe Li metal deposition during overcharge in Li-ion batteries. Hu et al. also used in situ NMR and computational modeling to investigate the role of Cs+ additive (Hu et al. 2016). These works indicate that NMR not only can detect the morphology variation during the Li metal deposition process, but also can reveal the possible composition of SEI layers formed on the surfaces of Li ﬁlms during the electrode plating process. By combining NMR and other characterization techniques, a more comprehensive understanding of the electrode plated Li ﬁlms can be obtained.

2.1.2 Characterization Methods for Surface Chemistry

2.1.2.1 FTIR
The characterization methods discussed in the previous sections mainly provide information on the morphology variations of Li depositions. Several other methods have been used to analyze the chemical compositions of the surface ﬁlms formed on the surface of deposited Li. The chemical composition of the Li surface ﬁlm is strongly related to the electrolyte components. In turn, the SEI ﬁlm formed on the surface of a Li deposition strongly affects the Li morphology and cycling performance of a Li metal battery (Aurbach et al. 1994). In this aspect, FTIR and XPS are widely used in this ﬁeld to analyze the Li surface chemistry; FTIR is more suitable for detecting the organic components, while XPS gives more information about the inorganic components.
Since the 1980s, FTIR has been widely used to analyze the Li surface as a nondestructive method (Morigaki 2002; Aurbach et al. 1987, 1995, 1997; Kanamura et al. 1997). In the early years, FTIR was used as an ex situ method (Aurbach et al. 1987), but it was later developed as an in situ technique to analyze Li ﬁlms during electrochemical processes (Morigaki 2002; Kanamura et al. 1997). FTIR has been used to investigate the inﬂuences of electrolyte solvents, salts, additives, and other contaminants on the Li surface. From the locations and strengths of the peaks in FTIR spectra, different chemical bonds or components on the Li electrode surface could be identiﬁed. An example is shown in Fig. 2.11 which shows FTIR spectra of Li electrodes prepared and stored for three days in EC-DMC solutions of 1 M LiAsF6, LiPF6, or LiBF4 as indicated. A spectrum of a Li electrode prepared and stored in DMC containing 0.1 M CH3OH is also presented for comparison (Aurbach et al. 1997).

2.1.2.2 XPS
It should be noted that although the FTIR technique is very useful to identify the surface components, it is limited in that it detects only the IR-active species and it cannot give the relative importance of each surface component and composition that affect the Li deposition morphology and battery performance. Therefore, other surface characterization methods and technologies besides FTIR are needed to get more detailed surface chemistry data on Li anodes. As mentioned above, XPS is another very useful tool to analyze the surface chemistry of Li electrodes; in particular, it gives more information about the elemental or inorganic components— data that FTIR cannot detect. Normally, as indicated from XPS and FTIR data by Aurbach et al. (1987), the major species in a Li surface ﬁlm include Li2O, LiOH, LiF, Li2CO3, lithium alkylcarbonate (RCOOLi), and hydrocarbon. Recently,

Wenzel et al. (2015) used the in situ XPS technique to study the stability of an SSE in contact with Li metal. The key concept was to use the internal Ar ion sputter gun in a standard lab-scale photoelectron spectrometer to deposit thin metal ﬁlms (e.g., Li) on the sample surface and to study the reactions between metal and SSE by photoelectron spectroscopy directly after deposition (Fig. 2.12). This approach could give information on interfacial reactions and the interfacial kinetics, especially for the interface between the alkali metal and solid electrolyte in solid-state batteries.
With XPS analysis, the effects of different electrolyte solvents (Ota et al. 2004a; Aurbach et al. 1993; Kanamura et al. 1995b), lithium salts (Kanamura et al. 1995a; Fujieda et al. 1994), and additives (Shiraishi et al. 1999; Odziemkowski et al. 1992) on the Li surface chemistry have been investigated. Based on these data, especially with the vacuum etching technology of the XPS technique, not only the components but also the structural composition evolution of the SEI ﬁlm can be revealed by XPS analysis (Ding et al. 2014; Kanamura et al. 1995a; Shiraishi et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2014; Aurbach et al. 1993; Qian et al. 2015a, b).

2.1.3 Other Characterization Techniques
In addition to the methods discussed in the above sections, several other methods, including Raman spectroscopy (Raman) (Kominato et al. 1997), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) (Ota et al. 2004a; Morigaki and Ohta 1998; Aurbach et al. 1993), and NMR (Kominato et al. 1997) have been used to analyze the surface chemistry of electroplated Li ﬁlms. So far, attempts to use Raman spectroscopy to identify the surface ﬁlms on the Li metal/electrolyte interphase have not been very successful. Only a few papers reported the Raman studies (Howlett et al. 2003; Rey et al. 1998a, b; Naudin et al. 2003). For example, Irish et al. used a Raman microprobe to study both in situ and ex situ the surface ﬁlms formed on Li metal in contact with electrolytes of LiAsF6/tetrahydrofuran (THF) and LiAsF6/2MeTHF (Odziemkowski et al. 1992). The reaction products detected were mainly polytetrahydrofuran, some arsenolite (As2O3), and arsenious oxyﬂuorides F2As-O-AsF2. Raman technology might be expected to yield results similar to those of FTIR spectroscopy, but this technology is more complicated to use than FTIR (Odziemkowski et al. 1992). In addition, as indicated by Naudin et al. (2003), local heating of the samples under laser irradiation is unavoidable in Raman tests. The carbonate species on Li surface could be transformed into lithium acetylides of Li2C2 type, which gives a vibration peak of CC at about 1845 cm−1, thus giving a

faulty result to the interpretation. Therefore, the destructive effect of Raman laser beam on Li surfaces limits its use in the analysis of Li surface ﬁlms.
Aurbach et al. (1993) used AES to measure the Li surface after the Li was immersed in an electrolyte of 0.2 M LiAsF6/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) for 15 min followed by pure DME rinsing. They found that the AES spectra were similar to those seen with XPS. Carbon and oxygen were detected at the Li surface. With sputtering, the intensity of the carbon Auger peak decreased while the oxygen peak increased when compared to their initial peaks. It was suggested that the surface ﬁlms of Li treated in DME consisted of two layers, the upper layer being an alkoxide ﬁlm (probably LiOCH3) and the layer close to Li being a mixture of Li2O and LiOH. Kominato et al. (1997) also used AES to detect the surface compounds of Li after it was immersed in three electrolytes of EC/DMC with LiPF6, LiClO4, or LiTFSI. Except for LiF found in the Li surface ﬁlm from the LiPF6-based electrolyte, all major components in the three Li surfaces were Li–O components indicating LiOH, Li2O, or other lithium oxide compounds. Morigaki and Ohta used scanning AES to analyze the Li surface in 1 M LiClO4/PC solution also used AES to detect the surface compounds of Li after it was immersed in three electrolytes of EC/DMC with LiPF6, LiClO4, or LiTFSI. Except for LiF found in the Li surface ﬁlm from the LiPF6-based electrolyte, all major components in the three Li surfaces were Li–O components indicating LiOH, Li2O, or other lithium oxide compounds. Morigaki and Ohta (1998) used scanning AES to analyze the Li surface in 1 M LiClO4/PC solution. Li2CO3, Li2O, and LiOH were localized on the ridge lines and the grain boundaries of the Li surface. AES technology can provide some useful information about the Li surface components, but it is very close to that obtained from XPS analysis. In addition, the AES equipment is more difﬁcult to access than XPS equipment, so AES analysis has been used less frequently in Li metal investigations.
NMR has also been used to study the Li surface chemistry. Ota et al. (2004a, c) used NMR technology (1H, 13C and 2D spectra) to analyze the surface components of deposited Li by dissolving the surface ﬁlm in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 and then recording the NMR spectra of the organic species in the DMSO-d6 solution. They found that the organic surface layer on Li metal included lithium ethoxide, lithium ethylene dicarbonate, PEO, and lithium ethylene containing an oxyethylene unit. This is an indirect method to analyze the Li surface focusing on the dissolvable organic species. The obvious limitation of this technique is the inability to analyze the insoluble inorganic compounds formed on Li surfaces.
Nazri and Muller used secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to study the surface layer formed on electrochemically deposited Li on copper in a 1 M LiClO4PC electrolyte (Nazri and Muller 1985b). The obtained SIMS spectrum was complex and was difﬁcult to interpret. Basically, the low mass range showed the fragments of PC, the salt, and water, while the high mass range indicated the presence of a polymeric material based on PC, a partially chlorinated hydrocarbon polymer, and their lithium adducts. The authors also applied the in situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) technique to the analysis of the formed Li surface ﬁlms (Nazri

and Muller 1985a, b, c). The presence of Li2CO3, Li2O, and polymer compounds was also detected.
Temperature-programmed decomposition mass spectroscopy (TPD-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technology were also used by several groups to analyze the surface components of Li electrodes (Matsuda et al. 1995). Kominato et al. (Morigaki and Ohta 1998; Kominato et al. 1997) reported that the gases generated from Li ﬁlms pretreated in EC-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) based electrolytes were mainly CH4, H2O, CO, CH3OH, CO2, and ethylene oxide. N2 was also detected if LiTFSI was used as the electrolyte salt. The GC-MS detected the same gas components. This indicated that the detected gases were generated from the organic Li compounds that were the reaction products of Li and solvents (EC and DMC) and included lithium ethylene dicarbonate and lithium methylcarbonate. Ota et al. (2004a, c) also used GC-MS to investigate the Li surface compounds generated in EC/THF electrolytes. C2H4, CO2, and C2H6 were detected and were mainly from the reductive components of EC. During TPD-MS and GC-MS measurements, the Li electrodes with the detected surface ﬁlms need to be heated to give off the gases to be tested. The data from these MS measurements could provide more information on the Li surface ﬁlm chemistry and support the results of other ﬁlm measurements, such as FTIR and XPS.
Ota et al. (2004a, c) used ion chromatography (IC) to quantitatively analyze the Li surface ﬁlms. The Li ﬁlms were ﬁrst dissolved in high-purity water and then tested by an IC instrument. By analyzing the contents of F−, CO32−, and Li+ ions, quantitative information about the Li surface ﬁlms could be obtained. They found that the Li surface ﬁlm in EC-based electrolytes consisted mainly of lithium alkyl carbonate, and LiF content in the ﬁlms formed in an electrolyte containing lithium imide salt was lower than those formed in the electrolytes containing LiPF6 salt.
The in situ scanning vibrating electrode technique has also been used to map the surface electric ﬁeld of Li electrodes (Matsuda et al. 1995; Ishikawa et al. 1997). The surface electric ﬁeld on a Li electrode is based on its morphology and composition uniformity. So this technology reﬂects not only the surface morphology, but also the chemical composition uniformity of the Li surface. However, because the scanning step of this technology is not small enough, the deﬁnition obtained using this technology is not satisfactory.
In a recent effort, Harry et al. (2014, 2015) used synchrotron hard x-ray microtomography to investigate the failure caused by dendrite growth in high-energy density, rechargeable batteries with Li metal anodes. When a symmetric Li|polymer electrolyte|Li cell was cycled at 90 °C, they found that the bulk of the dendritic structure lay within the electrode, underneath the polymer/electrode interface, during the early stage of dendrite development. Furthermore, they observed crystalline impurities, present in the uncycled Li anodes, at the base of the subsurface dendritic structures. The portion of the dendrite protruding into the electrolyte increases on cycling until it spans the electrolyte thickness, causing a short circuit. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it seems that preventing dendrite formation in polymer electrolytes depends on inhibiting the formation of subsurface structures in the Li electrode. These results demonstrate that x-ray

microtomography is another powerful tool to provide a clear failure mechanism in Li metal batteries.
In summary, characterization of morphologies and surface components of electroplated Li anodes is a complicated task. SEM and FTIR/XPS are the most common methods used to investigate the surface morphology and chemistry, respectively, of the electrodeposited Li ﬁlms. Many other methods discussed in this chapter also provide valuable information on Li ﬁlms. However, no single technique is enough to provide comprehensive understanding of the studied Li ﬁlms, especially for the surface reaction products or SEI layer formed on a Li ﬁlm. Therefore, a combination of multiple characterization and analysis methods is required to have a good understanding of the properties of electrodeposited Li ﬁlms.

2.2 Effect of SEI Layer on Lithium Dendrite Growth
Various models proposed in the literature have provided important guidance on the nucleation and growth of metal dendrites, especially for metals that do not react with electrolyte in a signiﬁcant way. However, Li is thermodynamically unstable with any organic solvent and the two react instantaneously to form an SEI. This SEI layer will continuously break down and regrow during Li deposition/stripping processes and is critical to the real growth pattern of reactive metals such as Li. Unfortunately, most models in the literature do not consider the impact of the SEI on the Li dendrite growth mechanisms. Recently, Cheng et al. (Cheng et al. 2015) reviewed the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are discussed. An extensive experimental study by Steiger et al. utilizing in situ light microscopy and ex situ SEM analysis concluded, however, that growth of the whisker/needle-like structures (often termed “dendrites”) occurs as follows (Steiger et al. 2014b, 2015; Steiger 2015):
• Li needle growth is generally initiated at either the substrate surface or from faceted particles of Li.
• Typically, the needles grow in length, but not in breadth. • Growth often does not actually occur at the tip, but rather behind an inactive
deposit located at the tip (possibly a particle of metal oxide, LiF or other SEI components) (Figs. 2.13, 2.14) (Steiger et al. 2014a). • Li+ cation transport through a thin SEI layer results in the overall needle growth which occurs—as just noted—at the needle tip (i.e., deposit-Li interface), at the base (i.e., substrate-Li interface), and at defects resulting in kinks in the needles. • Extensive shaking/twisting motions transpire during the needle growth process (Steiger et al. 2014a; Brissot et al. 1998; Nishikawa et al. 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012; Nishida et al. 2013; Yamaki et al. 1998)—a characteristic that is readily explained by the differing growth zones (kinks and interfaces) in Steiger’s model.

All steps proceed by Li insertion into the growing structure. Reproduced with permission —Copyright 2014, Elsevier (Steiger et al. 2014a)
A number of these points were also previously emphasized in publications by Yamaki et al. (1998) and Nishikawa et al. (2011). Note that Steiger’s model— which explains the observed Li kinked whisker/needle-like growth patterns quite well—diverges signiﬁcantly from previous models that have emphasized dendrite formation due to the depletion of Li+ cations near the electrode surface, ﬁeld enhancement at the needle (“dendrite”) tips, the strong inﬂuence of concentration gradients, and stresses that induce needle motion. Figure 2.15 shows SEM images of Li deposits on a stainless steel (SS) electrode after different times during which the electrode was polarized to −150 mV (versus Li/Li+) in 1 M LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolyte and 1 M N1114TFSI-LiTFSI (IL-based) electrolytes (Stark et al. 2013).

When the Li deposition rate is slow, the Li nuclei formed initially will merge together as shown in Fig. 2.15a. When the needles grow fast relative to the nucleation points, then tangled ﬁbrous aggregates of the kinked needles tend to result (Fig. 2.15b).
Very different Li deposition is sometimes observed that is referred to as nondendritic—i.e., the Li has a particulate/nodular structure, which may be fused into

24

2 Characterization and Modeling of Lithium Dendrite Growth

aggregated lumps or instead simply clustered together. This then requires a growth model that diverges from the linear needle model noted above. The Li deposition morphology is governed by Li+ cation mobility, Li0 (adatom) transport on the Li surface, and perhaps to some extent Li0 self-diffusion within the bulk of the Li. Most of the focus in many mathematical models developed is on the former (i.e., Li+ cation mobility within the electrolyte). Jäckle and Groß found that Li0 atom self-diffusion has relatively high barriers on the most energetically favorable surfaces of the Li body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal and also has a lower tendency (than Mg, for example) to adopt high-coordination conﬁgurations (Jäckle and Groß 2014). This reduces the driving force for surface reconstruction from needle-like to nodular shapes. Higher temperatures—with the corresponding increase in Li0 adatom mobility—would therefore be expected to favor more nodular Li structures (Aryanfar et al. 2015) and this will be shown below to indeed be the case. Another important consideration, however, is the Li+ cation transport rate through the SEI to the Li growth surface. As noted above, the kinked needle growth may be dictated by favorable insertion of Li0 adatoms at the tip (often below an inactive particle), the base and at defects resulting in one-dimensional growth. These may be locations where the resistance is lowest to Li+ cation transport through the SEI or alternatively locations which have the lowest interfacial energy and thus serve as a sink for the adatoms. Transport, however, will be more favorable throughout the entire SEI layer at higher temperature and/or for a more conductive/thinner SEI. Thus, temperature and electrolyte composition strongly impact the Li deposition morphology (Nishikawa et al. 2011).
It will be shown below that such growth actually begins as needles which then thicken into nodules—that is, the one-dimensional, linear elongation which creates the needles transitions at some point to three-dimensional growth at the needle tips and defects or alternatively thickening of the entire needle segment(s) (Steiger et al. 2014b; Steiger 2015; Arakawa et al. 1993; Nishikawa et al. 2011, 2012). A highly aligned Li growth pattern was observed when a robust and uniform SEI layer formed on the surface of the substrate as reported recently by Qian et al. (2015a), i.e., the one-dimensional, linear elongation that creates the needles transitions at some point to three-dimensional growth.
The trace amount of HF derived from the decomposition reaction of LiPF6 with H2O is electrochemically reduced during the initial Li deposition process to form a uniform and dense LiF-rich SEI layer on the surface of the substrate. This SEI layer is robust and leads to a uniform distribution of the electric ﬁeld on the substrate surface. In case of low rate deposition, the merged Li particles will favor growth into linear arrays of closely packed nanorods, since neighboring nanorods constrain the formation of the kinked defects, thereby enabling uniform and dendrite-free Li deposition. The surface and cross-section images of the as-deposited, dendrite-free Li ﬁlms exhibit a self-aligned and highly compact Li nanorod structure as shown in Fig. 2.16, which is consistent with a vivid blue color due to structural coloration. Similar surface morphology was also observed before by several other groups (Stark et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014; Qian et al. 2015a).

2.2.1 “Dead” Lithium
In an early publication in 1974, the effect of aging on the cycling CE of electrodeposited Li was examined using a 1 M LiClO4-PC electrolyte (Selim and Bro 1974). It was noted that the Li was mossy in appearance and that the CE (i.e., stripping/deposition charge ratio) decreased much more rapidly with increasing age of the deposit than did the Li metal content of the deposit (as determined chemically by reacting the Li with water and monitoring the amount of evolved gas generated). For example, after 40 h the CE approached zero, while the chemical analysis indicated that 80 % of the deposited Li remained (but could not be stripped from the electrode). This electrochemically unrecoverable Li has come to be known as “dead” Li (Yoshimatsu et al. 1988; Arakawa et al. 1993; Steiger et al. 2014b). Steiger et al. proposed a mechanism for this that illustrates how the “dead” Li may remain in physical, but not electrical contact with the electrode surface (Fig. 2.17) (Steiger et al. 2014b). This explains why after stripping the electroactive Li from a

previous electrodeposition, new needle-like Li deposits often tend to grow on the electrode surface instead of on the previous (residual) material on the electrode surface (Brissot et al. 1998). This continues until the entire surface of the electrode is covered by the needles and their SEI residue. Thus, the interphasial layer on the surface of the Li may actually grow/accumulate predominantly at the working electrode surface rather than at the interphasial layer/electrolyte interface.
It has been reported from in situ visualization studies for both liquid and polymer electrolytes that dendrites are often not evident during the ﬁrst few cycles at higher current densities (for which the CE is often relatively high), but then dendrites form and grow in subsequent cycles (often resulting in a continuous decline in the CE with continued cycling) (Dampier and Brummer 1977; Brissot et al. 1998, 1999b). This may be explained by the growth of short new needle-like deposits on the electrode surface during the ﬁrst few cycles until the electrode is covered in its entirety by the SEI residue and “dead” Li. Then, breakaway Li dendritic structures form while Li deposits on the electrode escape in the following cycles through defects in this resistive layer, culminating in the exposure of protruding kinked needles for which Li0 adatom addition is more facile, thus resulting in rapid growth of such dendrites.

2.2.2 Interphasial Layer and Formation of Mossy Lithium

For Li-ion batteries in which graphite is used as the anode, the SEI is generally a thin layer of reaction products formed from the degradation of the graphite (near the electrolyte interface), Li, solvent molecules, anions and/or other electrolyte components. Comparable SEI layers may form on the Li metal surface as noted in the discussion above on the needle growth mechanism. But rather than passivating the electrode from further reactions with the electrolyte, the dead Li forms an interphasial porous degradation layer (often termed “mossy” Li) that is much more substantive than the relatively thin SEI layer formed on the graphite surface. Upon cycling, there is thus a transition from a ﬂat, smooth morphology to a rugged structure with a surface interphasial layer that continues to grow in thickness upon cycling (Figs. 2.18, 2.19) (Naoi et al. 1996; Orsini et al. 1998, 1999; López et al. 2009, 2012; Chang et al. 2015; Lv et al. 2015). In comparison, more mossy Li is formed at low current density and more dendrite is formed at high-current density (Orsini et al. 1999). The increased resistance results in increased polarization (i.e., higher absolute voltages for plating/stripping) (Fig. 2.20) and the “dead” Li may mask portions of the electrode (i.e., reduce the active surface area available for

deposition), thus increasing the effective current density which, as will be shown below, often results in more rapid Li consumption and possibly increased dendritic Li growth. This depletion of the electrolyte and electroactive Li due to degradation

reactions, as well as the increased interfacial resistance from the porous interphasial layer, has been delineated as a principal cause of cell performance degradation and failure (Fig. 2.21) (Lv et al. 2015), although dendritic short circuiting may occur in some instances (López et al. 2009, 2012; Orsini et al. 1998, 1999; Yoshimatsu et al. 1988). Thus, the large voltage spikes in Fig. 2.20 originate from the highly resistive interphase rather than from short circuiting (which would result in a very low potential between the electrodes). Importantly, for full batteries, the loss of electrolyte (and the corresponding signiﬁcant impedance increase) may ultimately be the key factor for the deterioration of the cell capacity rather than formation of the interphasial layer (Aurbach et al. 2000).
2.3 Modeling of Lithium Dendrite Growth
Signiﬁcant work has been done to simulate and predict the growth pattern of Li dendrite growth in the last half-century. When an electrochemical cell containing an electrolyte with a Li salt is sufﬁciently polarized, Li+ cations near the negative electrode are reduced to Li metal and—depending upon the applied current density and the electrolyte’s transport properties—the Li+ cation concentration decreases resulting in anion migration toward the positive electrode until equilibrium is reached. The newly formed Li metal may deposit as a relatively compact layer or in a variety of other morphologies which are often described as dendritic. A recent review of models for dendrite initiation/propagation described three classiﬁcations (Li et al. 2014b):

1. Surface Tension Model—This model ﬁnds that electrodeposition is more rapid on projections rather than planar surfaces because spherical rather than linear diffusion dominates the mass transport of the active species. A larger spherical diffusion ﬂux results in a narrowing of the growing dendrite tip; thus surface forces and mass transport dominate the kinetics governing dendrite growth (Monroe and Newman 2003, 2004, 2005; Barton and Bockris 1962; Diggle et al. 1969).
2. Brownian Statistical Simulation Model—This model focuses on the competition between ion transport and reductive deposition. When deposition probability is

31

low, Li+ cation transport dominates and the ions penetrate close to the substrate resulting in a dense plating morphology with a low tendency for dendrite formation. This is contrasted with the case of high-deposition probability (relative to the cation transport), which increases the rate of deposition at the tip of projecting growth structures thus increasing the tendency for dendrite formation (Mayers et al. 2012; Voss and Tomkiewicz 1985; Magan et al. 2003). 3. Chazalviel Electromigration-Limited Model—This model for dendrite growth is often cited: at a time s called the Sand time, the Li+ cation concentration drops to zero at the negative electrode with high currents, causing the potential to diverge; this results in an instability at the interface from inhomogeneities in the distribution of the surface potential, which creates a localized electric ﬁeld that leads to dendrite growth. The dendrite initiation time thus corresponds to the buildup of the space charge and the dendrite propagation velocity is tied to the transport of the anions (Brissot et al. 1998; Chazalviel 1990).
In addition to these, several new models have recently been proposed to describe Li plating/growth (Akolkar 2013, 2014; Chen et al. 2015; Cogswell 2015; Tang et al. 2009; Aryanfar et al. 2014). More details on a few of these important models of dendrite growth will be discussed in this section.

2.3.1 General Models
In the ﬁeld of electrodeposition, metal “dendrites” are a common phenomenon. At a given electrodeposition condition, many metals, such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and tin (Sn), were reported to exhibit ramiﬁed morphologies (Chazalviel 1990). Fractal deposits including needle-like, snowﬂake-like, tree-like, bush-like, moss-like, and whisker-like structures are all referred to as dendrites in this review. Extensive work has been done on the dendrite formation mechanism during electrodeposition of Zn and Cu. Various strategies have been unitized to suppress dendrite growth in these processes (Sawada et al. 1986; Diggle et al. 1969). The reported methods to suppress Zn dendrites include special separators, alternating current or pulsed charging, and additives in the electrolytes. The last methods can be further divided into three categories: electrode structural modiﬁers, metallic additives, and organic additives (Lan et al. 2007). Several factors such as Zn concentration, complexing agents, anions, and additives may modify the texture and morphology of Zn electrodeposited coatings (Mendoza-Huízar et al. 2009). Recently, Aaboubi et al. (2011) investigated the effect of tartaric acid on Zn electrodeposition from a sulfate plating bath by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), stationary polarization curves, XRD, and SEM imagery. The study shows that it is possible to obtain homogeneous, compact, and dendrite-free Zn deposits from sulfate solutions containing tartaric acid. Miyazaki et al. (2012)

2 Characterization and Modeling of Lithium Dendrite Growth

also reported suppression of dendrite formation in metallic Zn deposition using zinc oxide electrodes modiﬁed with an anion-exchange ionomer (AEI). These improvements are explained by selective ion permeation through the AEI ﬁlms. These approaches on Zn dendrite suppression and the techniques used in the investigation of Zn dendrite suppression and the technics used in the investigation of Zn dendrite growth are very useful for the investigation and prevention of Li dendrite growth.
Although most electrodepositions are a one-time-only process, in a rechargeable Li metal battery, Li metal needs to be plated on or stripped from substrates repeatedly during charge/discharge processes. As a result, Li dendrites will accumulate on the anode and ﬁnally lead to many serious problems (see Fig. 1.1) that hamper the practical application of rechargeable Li metal batteries. Therefore, a good understanding of the mechanism of Li dendrite formation and growth is critical to mitigate or further eliminate Li dendrites.
Many groups have simulated the Li dendrite formation and growth process, and proposed several meaningful and fundamental models in the last forty years. In order to simplify the simulation conditions, most models were based on a binary electrolyte with a Li salt and polymer; for example, LiClO4 or LiN(SO2CF3)2 (LiTFSI) in polyethylene oxide (PEO). In the open circuit condition, the electrolyte is in a steady state without an ionic concentration gradient; under polarization, the Li+ and anion will diverge and transfer to the negative and positive electrode, respectively. Li+ will obtain an electron and plate on the negative electrode. The speed of Li deposition or consumption of Li+ depends on the applied current density. Although the depletion of Li+ can be macroscopically compensated by the supply of Li+ from the positive electrode, the microscopic ionic distribution near the negative electrode dramatically affects the deposit’s morphology. Therefore, a basic model to simulate Li dendrite starts from the calculation of the concentration gradient in the Li symmetric cell under polarization. Brissot and Chazalviel et al. described the concentration gradient in a cell with a small inter-electrode distance using the following equation (Rosso et al. 2006; Brissot et al. 1999b):

eDðla þ lLiþ Þ

ð2:1Þ

where J is the effective electrode current density, D is the ambipolar diffusion coefﬁcient, e is the electronic charge, and la and lLi+ are the anionic and Li+ mobilities. From Eq. (2.1), two different conditions for a symmetrical Li/PEO/Li cell can be anticipated, with the inter-electrode distance L and initial Li salt concentration Co:
(a) If dC/dx < 2Co/L, the ionic concentration evolves to a steady state where the concentration gradient is constant and varies almost linearly from Ca ¼ Co À DCa at the negative electrode to CLiþ ¼ Co þ DCLiþ at the positive electrode, where

where ta and tLi+ represent the anionic and Li+ transference number, respectively. Chazalviel indicated that the anionic and Li+ concentrations
exhibit different behaviors at the Sand time, leading to an excess of positive
charge at the negative electrode. This behavior will result in a local space charge, form a large electric ﬁeld, and lead to nucleation and growth of Li dendrite. The results of their simulations and experiments conﬁrmed the concentration gradient and the occurrence of dendrites very close to Sand’s time (Brissot et al. 1998, 1999a). Chazalviel (1990) also predicted that the
dendrite will grow at the velocity of

Monroe and Newman developed the general model describing dendrite growth under galvanostatic conditions applicable to liquid electrolytes (Monroe and Newman 2003). They adopted the Barton and Bockris method (Barton and Bockris 1962) with the addition of thermodynamic reference points and the fact that concentration and potential are not constant during the course of dendrite growth. They calculated the concentration and potential distribution in the cell at different time intervals. It was demonstrated that the dendrite growth rate increases across the electrolyte and depends greatly on the applied current density; this will be discussed in more detail in the following section.
Rosso et al. reported a systematic study on the evolution of Li dendrites in LiTFSI-PEO electrolyte involving theoretical calculations as well as experimental data (Rosso et al. 2006). They demonstrated that even though the formation of dendrites has little effect on overall impedance, it signiﬁcantly decreases interfacial impedance. Based on the impedance data, the value of resistance due to the dendrites could be calculated. In addition, it was observed that dendrites can burn out like a fuse; that is, when the ﬁrst dendrite reaches the opposite electrode it shorts the circuit and the current density passing through this single dendrite becomes high enough to melt it. Thus, the ﬁnal short circuit occurs only when the major front of dendrites eventually reaches the opposite electrode.

2 Characterization and Modeling of Lithium Dendrite Growth

Although the formation of contiguous and conducting Li dendrites in batteries is often called “dendritic growth,” there are actually several modes of formation and growth: dendrites, whiskers, and “others.” The true dendrite grows from a Li metal surface in a nonaqueous electrolyte by adding material to its tip. The nutrient source is the Li in the electrolyte. Classical models of dendrite growth gave solutions in the form of the tip radius times its velocity, which has the units of diffusivity. Recent electrochemical continuum models (Rosso et al. 2001) and experiments (Bhattacharyya et al. 2010) for Li batteries have found that the dendrite growth is controlled by the tip surface energy, always accelerates across the cell under all conditions, and can be partially mitigated by lowering the limiting current or increasing the cell thickness. The latter two conditions limit the performance of the battery. A second type of growth has been simulated in some Li battery experiments. If the nutrient supply is drawn from the Li metal sheet, growth occurs at the base of a “whisker.” Yamaki (1998) analyzed the stress-assisted whisker growth through cracks in a protective layer (i.e., the separator) on the surface of the Li anode.

2.3.2 Effect of Current Density

It is well known that the effective current density during Li deposition/stripping has a signiﬁcant impact on the dendrite formation and growth. Generally, low current
density results in relatively stable cycling, and conversely, high current density
accelerates the degradation process of rechargeable Li metal batteries. The equation of Sand’s time indicates that the dendrite initiation time is proportional to J−2,
which indicates that high current density greatly accelerates the formation of Li dendrites. It is worth noting that there are some results showing s * J−1.25 rather than s * J−2 dependence, as reported by (Liu et al. 2010). They attributed this deviation to the local ﬂuctuations of current density. Moreover, the ionic liquid
(IL) used in their work acted as a supporting electrolyte. In fact, this is a ternary electrolyte rather than a binary one as assumed by Chazalviel’s model. In the model
developed by Monroe and Newman (2003) using liquid electrolyte, tip growth rate (mtip) can be expressed as

vtip

¼

JnV F

ð2:6Þ

where Jn is the effective current density normal to the dendrite (hemispherical) tip, V is the molar volume of Li and F is Faraday’s constant. This equation suggests that the dendrite growth rate is proportional to Jn. Based on Eq. (2.3) and (2.6), the dendrite initiation time could be delayed and the dendrite growth rate could be
slowed down if the effective current density could be decreased. By applying a
smaller current density, a smoother surface and improved cycling life have been

obtained (Kanamura et al. 1996; Aurbach et al. 2000; Zinigrad et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2000; Crowther and West 2008; Gireaud et al. 2006).
According to Chazalviel’s model, an applied current density leads to an ion concentration gradient—high-current density results in near-zero ion concentration at the negative electrode and the formation of Li dendrites at Sand’s time, low current density leads to a minimal and stable ion concentration gradient so no Li dendrites form in this condition. The crossover between the two regimes is the limiting current density

JÃ ¼ 2eCoD=taL

ð2:7Þ

where L is the inter-electrode distance, ta is the anionic transport number. When the current density is low or the inter-electrode distance L is small, there is in principle no Sand behavior and the concentration variation should be small. However, experimental results clearly indicate there are still Li dendrites, just not as serious as those at high-current density. Rosso et al. (2001) and Teyssot et al. (2005) attributed the formation of dendrites to local nonuniformity of the Li/electrolyte interface, which leads to a large concentration variance even in the depleted zone close to the conditions of Chazalviel’s model. Brissot et al. (1998) conﬁrmed this experimentally in a Li| LiTFSI-PEO|Li cell although individual dendrites could deviate from the predicted growth rate. It was demonstrated that at high current densities (when Li deposition becomes diffusion controlled), the onset of dendrite formation matched Sand’s time (zero ion concentration). However, dendrites started to grow earlier with cycling, apparently because of the created defects. At low current densities (i.e., when concentration variations were low), dendrites were also observed in the form of elongated metal ﬁlaments (higher aspect ratio), which could be a result of local inhomogeneity. Growth velocities followed Chazalviel’s model (Chazalviel 1990) in both cases. It was later shown by Rosso et al. (2001) that the time of dendrite appearance at low current densities is also proportional to the power of current density even though Sand’s behavior was not expected. It was proposed that the speciﬁc properties of LiTFSI-PEO electrolyte cause destabilization of the concentration distribution along the electrode surface. A direct relation between dendritic growth and concentration gradient was clearly demonstrated by employing three independent techniques to measure ion concentrations in the vicinity of dendrites (Brissot et al. 1999a).
In addition to the value of current density, the charging styles, galvanostat, or pulse also signiﬁcantly affects Li dendrite formation and growth. Recent work by Miller and coauthors reported that pulsed charging can effectively suppress Li dendrite formation by as much as 96 %. They proposed a coarse-grained lattice model to explain the mechanism of pulsed charging and revealed that dendrite formation arose from a competition between the time scales of Li+ diffusion and reduction at the anode, with lower overpotential and shorter electrode pulse durations shifting this competition in favor of lower dendrite formation probability (Mayers et al. 2012).

2 Characterization and Modeling of Lithium Dendrite Growth

2.3.3 Importance of Interfacial Elastic Strength

Monroe and Newman (2005) further employed linear elasticity theory to develop a kinetic model describing how mechanical properties of polymer electrolytes (shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio) affect roughness on the Li interface. The interface was subjected to a regime of small-amplitude two-dimensional (2D) perturbations. Analytic solutions with speciﬁc boundary conditions allowed computing deformation proﬁles. Compressive stress, deformation stress, and surface tension at the elastic Li interface were calculated as a next step. Incorporation of these parameters into the model gave a prediction of the distribution of exchange current density along the electrode surface. Finally, it was possible to verify that the mechanical properties of the polymer electrolyte stopped ampliﬁcation of the dendrite growth. It turned out that dendrite suppression can be achieved when the shear modulus of the electrolyte is about twice that of the Li anode (*109 Pa); that is, at least three orders of magnitude higher than that of the studied PEO.
As in many other ﬁelds, all of the models discussed above have their limitations. For example, the dendrite growth velocity proposed by Monroe and Newman (2003) (Eq. (2.6)) was derived from the growth of a single dendrite without considering the interaction between neighboring dendrites. It was also stated that the Chazalviel theory (Chazalviel 1990) has limited application in real batteries because it applies at currents higher than the limiting current. However, Rosso et al. (2001) and Teyssot et al. (2005) concluded that the Chazalviel model can be extended to low currents due to the nanoscale inhomogeneity in concentration, at least in the case of PEO-based electrolytes. Even though these models still include many simpliﬁcations and limitations, they have established a solid foundation for the nucleation and growth mechanisms of dendrites. More importantly, as we will discuss later in this book, several general predications of these models have been used successfully to identify new approaches to suppress dendrite growth, especially during Li metal deposition; for example, using an anode with large surface area to reduce the effective current density, developing a single ion conductor to enhance Li+ transference number, developing an electrolyte with strong shear modulus, and adding supporting electrolyte. These approaches will be discussed in detail in Chap. 3.

Chapter 3
High Coulombic Efﬁciency of Lithium Plating/Stripping and Lithium Dendrite Prevention

As described in Chaps. 1 and 2, the Li plating morphology and the CE—both of which are critical for the safety characteristics and cyclability of a Li metal battery —are intricately linked with one another. Almost all the factors that lead to signiﬁcant dendritic growth also lead to a lower CE and vice versa. This is because the needle-like (“dendritic”) growth results in a greater amount of Li metal surface exposure to the electrolyte. This freshly formed Li metal surface is thermodynamically unstable against the electrolyte solvent molecules, ions, additives, and impurities with which it quickly reacts to form degradation products which may or may not fully passivate the Li surface from further reactions. This continuously consumes both the electrolyte and Li and thus leads to a lower CE. To have a high CE, the side reactions must be minimized. The proclivity for these to occur is proportional to the chemical and electrochemical activity of native Li with the neighboring electrolyte, as well as to the surface area of the deposited Li. Therefore, a high Li cycling CE may be achieved by the use of less reactive electrolyte components, a reduction in the exposed Li surface and the rapid passivation of this surface. The strong correlation between the Li plating/striping (or Li cycling) CE and Li morphology suggests that these should be discussed in tandem in Chap. 3 when considering the impact of differing Li cycling environments and conditions. Special cases of dendrite-free Li plating of highly aligned nanorod structures, but with a low CE (related to the high surface area of the Li nanorods) will also be discussed (Qian et al. 2015a; Ding et al. 2013b).

3.1 Coulombic Efﬁciency of Lithium Plating/Stripping
The scientiﬁc literature associated with Li plating/stripping frequently discusses the efﬁciency of this process, but the methods used to determine the CE vary and often result in signiﬁcantly different values. The CE is often variable with cycling

conditions (current density, temperature) and may change considerably upon extended cycling or aging. Thus, reporting a speciﬁc value of the CE for a given electrolyte can be highly misleading without providing details of testing conditions.
Method 1 Using this method, the Li cycling CE is deﬁned by Aurbach (1999):

CE ¼ QS QD

ð3:1Þ

where QS and QD are the charges for Li stripping (dissolution) and plating (deposition) determined for each cycle, respectively. This method is often used when depositing Li on inert electrodes such as nickel (Ni), Cu, and tungsten (W).
Method 2 This method applies an initial known amount of deposition charge (QT) to plate Li metal on the working electrode (often Ni or Cu). Alternatively, if Li metal is used as the electrode, QT is determined from the electrode thickness and density. A fraction of this charge, i.e., the cycling charge (QD), is cycled across the cell for the stripping and subsequent plating with the overpotential for the process monitored during the cycling. When the overvoltage signiﬁcantly increases (indicating depletion of all of the deposited Li or an increased impedance due to a highly resistive interphase), the test is completed. The CE from this method can therefore be determined by (Aurbach 1999)

where N is the total number of cycles for the cell (Appetecchi et al. 1998, 1999). In
practice, it may take a long time to exhaust all Li (QT) deposited in the initial cycle. Therefore, a simpliﬁed formula for average CE in n cycles (n < N) has been used:

The factor of two accounts for the two steps in each cycle in which the Li is reduced at one electrode and oxidized at the other. This effectively doubles the losses with respect to a battery in which the Li is only oxidized during the discharge and reduced during the charge (Appetecchi and Passerini 2002). This equation is derived from the single-step-efﬁciency equation:

CE ¼ ðQD À QLÞ Â 100 % QD

ð3:5Þ

where QL is the charge for the lost Li in each step (if QL = 0, the CE = 100 %). With Li electrode, however, QL can only be determined by cycling the cell until all of the charge for the Li is lost, i.e., QT = 2nQL for a Li||Li cell (at which point the overpotential increases rapidly). By substituting this into Eq. (3.5), the CEavg Eq. (3.4) can be derived.

The FOMLi is thus [the total accumulated cell capacity]/[theoretical Li capacity or Li turnover number]. This value facilitates the recognition of differences in Li cyclability since an increase in the CE from 0.98 to 0.99 corresponds to an increase in the FOM from 50 to 100 which signiﬁes a doubling of the cell cycle life (Arakawa et al. 1999).

3.2 Electrolyte and In Situ Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase
The components of electrolytes used for Li+ cation transport vary widely (Marcinek et al. 2015). Although ionic conductivity is most often used as a prime factor for electrolyte optimization since it is one of the determinants for the overall cell resistance and thus the power capability of a cell (Dudley et al. 1991), this property is of little utility for determining the stability of a given electrolyte with Li metal (Tobishima et al. 1995). The consequence of this is that the Li plating characteristics (i.e., morphology, reactivity, etc.) and their relationship to the plating/stripping current density are generally not directly correlated with variations in the electrolyte conductivity. Conditions that favor a high cycling CE include the following:

48

1. uniform (compact) Li deposition which minimizes the surface area of the plated Li exposed to the electrolyte,
2. the formation of a stable passivation layer which protects the Li from further reactions with electrolyte components—if such a layer is elastic, then it can stretch and contract as necessary to conform to changes in the Li volume and may aid in the redeposition of Li underneath such a layer thus reducing the exposure of fresh Li to the electrolyte (Aurbach 1999).
In particular, the deposition morphology is a function of the electrolyte solvent (s), salt(s), salt concentration, current density, temperature, and other factors. The SEI layer formed is often strongly inﬂuenced by contaminants or additives, even at the ppm level. Comparisons between the various studies reported in the literature must take this into consideration. In addition, in contrast with graphite anodes in which the passivating layer is supported on the graphite surface, the surface layers that form on electrodeposited Li may be, and usually are, disrupted when the Li is stripped away during cell discharge (for nodular deposits) or lack electrical contact with the current source (for needle-like deposits, which generate dead Li) (Fig. 2.17).
Although passivation ﬁlms are known to form on the Li anode surface in batteries such as Li||SOCl2 primary cells, the role of this layer for Li stabilization was emphasized by Dey (1977) and (Peled 1979, 1983; Peled et al. 1997) who dubbed it a “solid electrolyte interphase” (SEI). The contributing components to the SEI and the effect that this has on Li plating/stripping will be discussed below. Note, however, that the study of the composition of the SEI layer is complicated by many factors, including the continuous evolution of the SEI during cycling/storage, changes that may occur from rinsing the surface (prior to ex situ characterization) or due to high vacuum conditions and transformations of the components due to Ar+ sputtering during XPS depth analysis (Verma et al. 2010; Edström et al. 2006; Ota et al. 2004c). Thus, some caution should be exercised when interpreting the results reported in the diverse studies available in the literature.
Typically, as-received Li metal has surface coatings consisting principally of Li2O (in contact with the Li) and an outer coating of LiOH and Li2CO3 (Hong et al. 2004; Kanamura et al. 1992, 1994b, 1995b, d, 1997; Shiraishi et al. 1995). Once the Li contacts the electrolyte, these native layers are transformed by both chemical and electrochemical reactions with the electrolyte components. The SEI ﬁlms formed on Li in contact with an electrolyte are typically multi-layered with the species becoming more inorganic in nature (i.e., more fully reduced) the closer they are to the Li surface (Schechter et al. 1999). Over time, the interphasial layer may continue to grow in thickness due to continuous reactions, but the SEI composition may also be continuously transformed (Aurbach et al. 1994a, 1995b). Impurities such as dissolved gases (e.g., O2, CO2), H2O, or others are often the most reactive constituents of the electrolyte and, as such, these reactions may dominate the characteristics of the as-formed SEI layers. For solvents that are relatively reactive (e.g., esters and carbonates), solvent degradation is the next most important factor

3.2 Electrolyte and In Situ Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase

in determining the composition of the SEI. If the electrolytes instead have solvents that are more stable to reduction (e.g., ethers), then anion degradation may be very inﬂuential in the SEI’s composition (Aurbach et al. 1994b).

3.2.1 Inﬂuence of Solvents
Molecular orbital (MO) theory allows for an approximate estimation of the oxidative and reductive stability of a molecule or ion. A higher level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy indicates that the species is a stronger electron donor and thus more susceptible to oxidation, while a lower level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy indicates a stronger electron acceptor, which is more readily reduced. The theory allows for an approximate estimation of the oxidative and reductive stability of a molecule or ion. Figure 3.1 indicates that according to MO theory ether solvents are signiﬁcantly more stable to reduction than ester and carbonate solvents, but the ethers also tend to have a lower oxidative stability than carbonates (Wang et al. 1999). Note, however, that the stability of the solvents to oxidation and reduction is considerably different when they coordinate a cation (e.g., the formation of a coordinate bond involves electron

donation, which makes the solvent less/more susceptible to donating/accepting an electron to/from an electrode). For example, it has been demonstrated that the oxidative stability of glymes is greatly increased for highly concentrated electrolytes in which all of the solvent molecules are coordinated (Pappenfus et al. 2004; Yoshida et al. 2011). A corresponding decrease in reductive stability upon coordination is also expected (Aurbach and Gottlieb 1989).
Aurbach et al. (1997) used FTIR spectra (Fig. 2.11) to analyze the composition of SEI layers formed on Li electrodes prepared and stored for three days in EC-DMC solutions of 1 M LiAsF6, LiPF6 and LiBF4. They have deduced and listed the possible components on the Li surface and their corresponding peaks in FTIR spectra (Aurbach et al. 1990a, 1994b, 1995c). Some possible chemical reactions on the Li surface have also been proposed as shown in Scheme 3.1) (Aurbach et al. 1990a, 1997).

3.2.1.1 Esters

Esters (Fig. 3.2) are attractive electrolyte solvents due to their high oxidative stability and the very high conductivity of ester-based electrolytes, especially at low temperature. In addition to Li+ cation solvation via the ester carbonyl oxygen, when methyl formate (MF) is used, anion solvation via hydrogen bonding to the MF formyl proton also occurs which further reduces ionic association interactions (Plichta et al. 1987; Venkatasetty 1975; Tobishima et al. 1990).
Rauh and Brummer reported that slow gas evolution occurs when Li is contacted with MF or methyl acetate (MA) and a white solid appears on the surface of the Li, whereas n-butyl formate (BF) was inert under the same conditions. LiAsF6 addition improved the Li stability at elevated temperature, and the amount of gas evolution from Li immersed in LiAsF6-ester electrolytes (heated up to 74 °C) indicated that the stability increased in the order MF > MA > ethyl acetate (EA) (Rauh and Brummer 1977b; Dampier and Brummer 1977). In general, the reactivity with Li increased with increasing alkyl chain length (methyl to butyl) and on transitioning from formates to acetates to propionates (Herr 1990). Tobishima et al., however, instead found that a 1.5 M LiAsF6-MA electrolyte had a higher Li cycling CE than a 1.5 M LiAsF6-MF electrolyte—which is also the case for the electrolytes with mixtures of these solvents and EC (Tobishima et al. 1989, 1990, 1995). The reason for this disagreement is unclear. Electrolytes with MA corrode Li to a much greater extent than those with PC, possibly due to the higher solubility of the reaction products resulting in the continuous exposure of Li to the solvent (Rauh and Brummer 1977b). It was found, however, that electrolytes in which MF or MA is mixed with a carbonate solvent such as DMC, DEC, or EC tend to have an improved CE (Tobishima et al. 1990; Plichta et al. 1989; Tachikawa 1993).
Herr (1990) indicated that esters may exist in both a stable keto form, as well as a reactive enol form. The enol form may readily be reduced by Li. Since MF does not

form an enol, it cannot undergo such a reaction. Thus, MF is relatively stable to Li —in contrast to MA (Table 3.1.) (Herr 1990). Rauh (1975) indicated, however, that degradation may instead occur in a similar manner to the well-known reduction of carbonyl compounds by alkali metals. It is noteworthy that MF is susceptible to hydrolysis from trace amounts of H2O (in both acidic and basic solutions) (Marlier et al. 2005), forming formic acid, which can then be dehydrated to form H2O and CO; the H2O from this then reacts with additional MF. Residual acidic LiAsF5OH in LiAsF6 is believed to have catalyzed this reaction for MA-based electrolytes in early studies. The use of highly puriﬁed LiAsF6 signiﬁcantly decreased this reaction (Herr 1990). Hydrolysis can also occur in LiBF4-MF electrolytes, but it was suggested that the LiF present with the LiBF4 prevents the subsequent dehydration of the formic acid (Herr 1990). Thus, electrolytes with both LiAsF6 and LiBF4 in MF are more stable to Li than those without the latter salt as indicated by improved cycling performance and by an increase in the time (from 1 to 10 months on storage of Li in the electrolyte at 74 °C) before a detectable amount of gas generation was identiﬁed (Herr 1990; Plichta et al. 1989; Honeywell 1975; Ebner and Lin 1987). Instead of degrading to H2O and CO, the formic acid may also directly react with the Li since spectroscopic evaluations of the SEI indicate that the major MF reduction product is Li formate (Table 3.1) (Aurbach and Chusid (Youngman) 1993; Ein-Eli and Aurbach 1996).
Cyclic esters, such as gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), have a high ﬂash point and low vapor pressure which reduces the ﬂammability of electrolytes with such solvents (Hess et al. 2015). The use of 1 M LiX-GBL electrolytes (with LiAsF6, LiClO4, LiBF4, or LiCF3SO3) resulted in a relatively low Li cycling CE and the SEI formed in these electrolytes did not effectively passivate Li foil from continuous reactions on storage (Sazhin et al. 1994). This may be due to the relatively high solubility of the GBL reaction products (Aurbach and Gottlieb 1989; Aurbach et al. 1991a; Rendek et al. 2003; Aurbach 1989a, b). Kanamura et al. (1995d) noted that when Li foil was immersed in a 1 M LiBF4-GBL electrolyte for 3 days, the electrode resistance initially decreased, but then increased steadily with time and the resulting SEI consisted predominantly of LiF with only a small amount of organic compounds present. The SEI formed on Li foil with GBL electrolytes with LiAsF6, LiPF6, or LiClO4 also contained little to no organic components (Kanamura et al. 1995b). This may again be due to the high solubility of the organic salts produced from GBL degradation (Table 3.1).

3.2.1.2 Alkyl Carbonates
As is the case for esters, alkyl carbonates (Fig. 3.2) are not overly stable to Li reduction (Fig. 3.1). Cyclic carbonates (e.g., EC and PC) are either reduced to Li2CO3 and ethylene (or propylene) or the carbonyl group is instead reduced to form a radical anion which then further reacts to form organic salts and polymers

(Gachot et al. 2008; Herr 1990; Nazri and Muller 1985a; Aurbach et al. 1987; Aurbach and Gottlieb 1989; Ota et al. 2004c; Wang et al. 2001). EC therefore is thus reduced principally to lithium ethylene dicarbonate (CH2OCO2Li)2 and lithium ethoxide (CH3CH2OLi), as well as other degradation products such as (CH2CH2OCO2Li)2, LiO(CH2)2CO2(CH2)2OCO2Li, Li(CH2)2OCO2Li, and Li2CO3 (Wang et al. 2001). PC undergoes similar reactions. PC (and EC) can also be nucleophilically attacked by OH− from the native ﬁlm (LiOH) or generated by the reaction of Li with trace H2O yielding lithium alkyl carbonate(s) (e.g., ROCO2Li) and Li2CO3 (Table 3.1) (Aurbach 1999).
Kanamura et al. noted that when Li foil was immersed in a 1 M LiBF4-PC electrolyte for 3 days, the electrode resistance initially decreased, but then increased steadily with time, and the resulting SEI consisted predominantly of LiF with only a small amount of organic compounds present—as with GBL electrolytes—but the impedance was an order of magnitude higher than those for the comparable GBL electrolytes (Kanamura et al. 1995b). Koike et al. also found that a 1 M LiClO4-PC electrolyte continuously reacted with the deposited Li, indicating that the SEI layer did not effectively passivate the Li (Koike et al. 1997; Nishikawa et al. 2010; Qian et al. 2015b; Ding et al. 2013a). Ding et al. (2013a) scrutinized the CE and morphology of Li deposited on Cu from 1 M LiPF6-carbonate electrolytes (with PC, EC, DMC, and EMC). The deposits from cyclic carbonates (PC and EC) were clusters of thick, tangled needles, whereas those for the acyclic carbonates (DMC and EMC) were more ﬁbrous and only partially covered the Cu substrate (Fig. 3.3). The surface layer of the SEI ﬁlms from the PC and EC electrolytes were composed principally of LiF and Li2CO3, with more of the former for the PC electrolyte and more of the latter for the EC electrolyte. PC appears to be more reactive with the LiPF6 salt since this electrolyte became discolored on storage, whereas the others did not. More organic compounds/salts that were less effective at passivating the Li surface were formed in the acyclic carbonates. The average Li cycling CE values for the 1 M LiPF6-carbonate electrolytes were the following: PC (77 %), EC (95 %), DMC (24 %), and EMC (7 %) (Ding et al. 2013a).
Other studies have also shown that electrolytes with DMC generally result in a superior CE and surface passivation relative to those with DEC (or EMC) (Ding et al. 2013a; Tachikawa 1993). This despite the fact that lithium alkyl carbonate and lithium alkoxide reduction products are formed for all of these acyclic solvents (Table 3.1). Aurbach et al. (1987) noted that Li metal dissolves completely when immersed in pure DEC due to a lack of passivation, resulting in a brownish solution. Tachikawa (1993) also noted a brown discoloration of the solution during Li deposition (on a Ag electrode) using a 1 M LiClO4-DEC electrolyte. Aurbach et al. (1987) reported that the main reaction products were lithium alkyl carbonates and lithium alkoxides (Table 3.1) with no detectable Li2CO3 evident. This suggests that the partially reduced alkyl carbonate undergoes radical reactions rather than a second electron transfer which would yield the fully reduced species (i.e., Li2CO3) (Gachot et al. 2008). This differs from the cyclic carbonates which do tend to form

Li2CO3, perhaps due to the greater stability of the intermediate radical for these cyclic solvents relative to that for DEC. The poor passivation and discoloration originate because the DEC reduction products—CH3CH2OLi and CH3CH2OCO2Li —are soluble in DEC solutions (Schechter et al. 1999; Ding et al. 2013a; Tachikawa 1993).

3.2.1.3 Ethers

Ethers (Fig. 3.2) tend to be much more stable to reduction than esters and carbonates (Fig. 3.1) (Aurbach and Gottlieb 1989). Thus, the use of ethers as electrolyte solvents usually results in the highest CE when plating/stripping Li. Early work focused on diethyl ether Et2O, THF, and 2MeTHF (Koch et al. 1982; Abraham et al. 1982). Kanamura et al. noted that when Li foil was immersed in a 1 M LiBF4-THF electrolyte for 3 days, the electrode resistance variation with time differed markedly from that for electrolytes with GBL and PC. The resistance remained relatively low for approximately 36 h and then grew rapidly to a value comparable to that for the PC electrolyte. The resulting SEI consisted of both LiF and a relatively large amount of organic compounds. It was suggested that the HF present initially reacted with the native ﬁlm to form LiF and the THF percolated through the native surface layer to the Li and reacted to form organic products (Kanamura et al. 1995d). LiAsF6-2MeTHF electrolytes, however, result in a signiﬁcantly higher Li cycling CE than do comparable LiAsF6-THF electrolytes, as well as those with Et2O (Goldman et al. 1980; Abraham and Goldman 1983; Abraham et al. 1982, 1986). It has been proposed that ring-opening reactions are signiﬁcantly slower with 2MeTHF and this accounts for the improved cycling with this solvent (Goldman et al. 1980; Koch 1979).
Glymes behave somewhat differently from the cyclic ethers. Aurbach et al. proposed a mechanism for DME reduction in which a radical anion is formed which is stabilized by a Li+ cation which decomposes to CH3OLi and a methoxy ethyl radical. This then undergoes a second electron transfer producing an additional CH3OLi and ethylene (Table 3.1) (Aurbach et al. 1988, 1993). Unfortunately, when used as single solvents for electrolytes with varying Li salts, glymes often result in crystalline solvates with high melting temperatures—except for electrolytes with dilute salt concentrations (Henderson 2006). There are thus few studies of Li plating/stripping in electrolytes with glyme solvents alone.
1,3-dioxolane (DOL) was found to be particularly useful as an electrolyte solvent. Dominey et al. reported that LiClO4-DOL electrolytes resulted in smooth Li deposits with a very high Li cycling CE (Dominey and Goldman 1990; Shen et al. 1991; Dominey et al. 1991). Electrolytes with high purity were found to form SEI layers consisting of both alkoxides (e.g., CH3CH2OCH2OLi) and LiCl (Aurbach et al. 1990b). LiClO4-DOL electrolytes, however, were found to detonate due to an uncontrolled reaction as the electrolyte rapidly polymerized generating excessive heat (Newman et al. 1980). Replacement of the salt with LiAsF6 and the use of additives such as 2mehtylfuran (2MF) and KOH—which scavenge the trace amounts of acidic species that polymerize DOL—resulted in a dramatic improvement in the cyclability of Li/TiS2 cells Dominey and Goldman (1990; Goldman et al. 1989). Tributyl amine (Bu3N) was also found to be a highly effective stabilizer to limit/prevent the chemical polymerization of the DOL for LiAsF6-DOL electrolytes (Gofer et al. 1992). This formulation of electrolyte components resulted in nodular Li deposition with an exceptionally high Li cycling CE (Gofer et al. 1992;

Zaban et al. 1996; Dan et al. 1997; Aurbach and Moshkovich 1998; Zinigrad et al. 2004; Aurbach 1999; Aurbach et al. 2002b; Mengeritsky et al. 1996a).

3.2.1.4 Mixed Solvents
Interestingly, mixing two or more solvents is found, in some instances, to result in an improved Li cycling CE relative to comparable single solvent electrolytes. For example, this is the case for MF and acyclic carbonate (Table 3.1) (Salomon 1989; Tachikawa 1993; Plichta et al. 1989) and the addition of DMC or DEC to MF-based electrolytes was found to improve the cycling efﬁciency of Li||LiCoO2 cells (Plichta et al. 1989). Single solvent electrolyte studies with EC have not been extensively studied due to this solvent’s high melting temperature, but it has been widely used as a co-solvent. The combination of EC and other solvents increases the Li cycling CE, often quite signiﬁcantly relative to the values for the single solvent electrolytes (including ethers), to average values >90 % (Fig. 3.4) (Tobishima et al. 1989, 1990). The Li surface chemistry of EC-DMC and EC-DEC mixtures is dominated by EC reduction, but this is more signiﬁcant for Li passivation for the mixtures with DMC because the solvent reduction products are less soluble in DMC than in DEC (Schechter et al. 1999). In particular, Wang et al. found that electrolytes with EC, cyclic ethers, and lithium bis(perﬂuoroethylsulfonyl)imide (LiBETI) resulted in a good cycling performance, high thermal stability, high conductivity, and the homogeneous deposition of nodular Li with a relatively high CE (>90 %) (Wang et al. 1999, 2000; Xianming et al. 2001; Ota et al. 2004a). After 50 plating/stripping cycles, the interphasial layer was much thinner for the electrolyte with the cyclic ether (tetrahydropyranyl, THP) than for DME, carbonates (DMC and PC), and an ester (GBL) (Fig. 3.5), which accounts for the signiﬁcant variances in the Li cycling performance with these electrolytes (Fig. 3.6) (Ota et al. 2004a). A detailed analysis of the SEI concluded that the outer layer consisted of ROCO2Li (typical for EC), polymers, and LiF, while the inner layers contained Li2O and carbide species with C–Li bonds (Ota et al. 2004c). The polymers were determined to be lithium

passivates the surface (than occurs for EC mixtures with glymes, carbonates, and esters), thus explaining the higher CE and reduced interfacial layer thickness.
3.2.2 Inﬂuence of Lithium Salts
Kanamura et al. (1995b) found that immersion of Li foil electrodes in 1 M LiX-GBL (with LiX is LiAsF6, LiPF6, LiClO4, or LiBF4) electrolytes resulted in only limited reactions of the native ﬁlm with the LiAsF6 and LiClO4 electrolytes with major SEI species being LiOH and Li2CO3 and minor species of LiF (or LiCl) in the outer layer and Li2O in the inner layer. For the LiBF4 electrolyte, the SEI outer layer consisted principally of LiF with LiOH and Li2CO3 present as minor species and LiF and Li2O as major and minor components, respectively, of the inner layer indicating the greater reactivity of the BF4− anion. The SEI ﬁlm formed in the LiPF6 electrolyte, however, was thinner and more compact than that for the other electrolytes, but the resistance of this ﬁlm was also much higher (with rapid reactions occurring just after immersion) (Kanamura et al. 1994b, 1995b). Koike et al. (1997) also reported that a 1 M LiPF6-GBL electrolyte formed a thin, compact ﬁlm on a Ni electrode during Li deposition. Kanamura et al. noted that the outer SEI layer resulting from the LiPF6 electrolyte consisted principally of LiF with organic compounds, LiOH and Li2CO3 present as minor species, while the inner layer was composed of LiF and Li2O. After 3 days of storage in the electrolytes, Li was plated onto the Li foil electrodes. This resulted in tangled dendritic needles for the LiAsF6, LiClO4, and LiBF4 electrolytes, but the electrolyte with LiPF6 seems to instead have formed a compact array of needles (Kanamura et al. 1994b, 1995b). This difference in behavior may perhaps be explained by the H2O content in the electrolyte (reported as <100 ppm), since this amount of water is known to strongly

inﬂuence HF formation and Li deposition morphology for a 1 M LiPF6-PC electrolyte (Qian et al. 2015a).
Ding et al. (2013a) reported substantial differences in the Li morphology when plating from 1 M LiX-PC electrolytes. The average Li cycling CE values for the 1 M LiX-PC electrolytes were as follows:

LiAsF6ð95 %Þ $ LiBOBð93 %Þ [ LiDFOBð86 %Þ [ LiPF6ð77 %Þ [ LiCF3SO3ð73 %Þ $ LiClO4ð72 %Þ $ LiTFSIð72 %Þ $ LiBF4ð72 %Þ $ LiIð69 %Þ

Interestingly, the morphology reported for the lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB) electrolyte was highly ﬁbrous, but resulted in a high CE, whereas the Li morphology for the electrolytes with the other salts resembled entangled thick
needles or nodules, especially for the electrolytes that gave the highest CE values
(Fig. 3.7) (Ding et al. 2013a). Aurbach has noted that a relatively high Li cycling CE is achievable, even for a ﬁbrous Li deposition morphology, if the SEI contains a signiﬁcant amount of Li2CO3 (Aurbach et al. 1992). This was attributed to the fact that the ﬁbrous Li deposit formed with a Li2CO3 coating adhered very well to the

electrode surface, in contrast to ﬁbrous deposits formed in other electrolytes that lack Li2CO3 in the SEI layer. Although Li2CO3 might be expected to be a product from the reaction of the oxalate from the BOB− anion, an XPS analysis found that Li2CO3 was absent. Alkyl oxalate and borate species may therefore instead account for the relatively high CE for the LiBOB electrolyte (Ding et al. 2013a).
For PC electrolytes with varying Li salts, Zaban and Aurbach (1995) differentiated between reactive salts (LiBF4, LiPF6, LiCF3SO3, and LiTFSI) and nonreactive salts (LiBr, LiClO4, and LiAsF6). When the nonreactive salts were used, the Li-electrolyte interface was stable upon storage, whereas the interfacial resistance continuously increased upon storage for electrolytes with reactive salts and was strongly dependent upon salt concentration. Geronov et al. (1982), however, reported that the Li-electrolyte resistance for 0.5 M LiX-PC electrolytes did increase over time, but to a much lesser extent for the electrolyte with LiAsF6 than for the one with LiClO4. Kanamura et al. (1997) also found that the SEI formed on Li immersed in a 1 M LiClO4-DEC electrolyte became thick and was composed of a mixture of LiOH, Li2CO3, alkyl carbonates, alkoxides, and Li2O, whereas immersion of Li in a 1 M LiPF6-DEC electrolyte resulted in a compact SEI composed mostly of an inner layer of Li2O and an outer layer of LiF (Figs. 3.8 and 3.9).
Wang et al. (1999) noted that for 1 M LiX-EC/THF (1/1) electrolytes, the Li cycling CE increased in the order as follows:

LiTFSI % LiBETI [ LiClO4 [ LiBF4 [ LiPF6
These authors found that the SEI formed during the plating/stripping from the LiPF6 electrolyte contained a signiﬁcant amount of LiF and residual Li was present after the stripping step, whereas very little LiF was present for the LiTFSI electrolyte and no residual Li was found after the stripping step. These authors also reported an improved CE for LiTFSI- and LiBETI-based electrolytes relative to LiPF6-based electrolytes with EC/DME and EC/DEC mixed solvents (Wang et al. 2000a). Zaban et al. (1996) examined the resistance of the Li-electrolyte interface upon storage in 1 M LiX-EC/DEC (3/1) electrolytes. Notably, the resistance of the interface was an order of magnitude higher for the electrolytes with LiPF6 and LiBF4 relative to those with LiAsF6 and LiClO4 (Figs. 3.10 and 3.11).
Tobishima et al. (1995) found that the CE for 1 M LiX-EC/2MeTHF (1:1) electrolytes increased in the following order:

LiAsF6 [ LiClO4 [ LiBF4 [ LiSbF6 [ LiCF3SO3 [ LiPF6
Herr (1990) reported that the CE for 1 M LiX-MF electrolytes increased in the following order:

The electrolyte salt thus plays a prominent role in the Li cycling performance. The strong disparity in behavior noted for LiAsF6 and LiPF6, despite their structural similarities, may be due to the substantial differences in the reductive stability of the anions. A study of THF and sulfolane electrolytes with LiAsF6 and LiPF6 found that AsF6− tend to be reduced to AsF3 as follows:
AsFÀ6 þ 2eÀ $ AsF3 þ 3FÀ
FÀ þ Li þ $ LiF
The LiF is insoluble in the electrolyte and thus remains on the electrode surface (i.e., becomes part of the SEI). In contrast, the PF6− anion is not readily reduced, but this anion does disproportionate as follows:
PFÀ6 $ PF5 þ FÀ

The PF5 can then initiate the polymerization of cyclic ethers, while the F− forms LiF (Nanjundiah et al. 1988). However, unlike the SEI formed with LiPF6-based electrolytes which contain little phosphorus, those produced from LiAsF6-based electrolyte contain arsenic and arsenic compounds (Aurbach et al. 2002a; Zaban et al. 1996):
AsFÀ6 þ 2Li ! 2LiF þ AsF3
AsF3 þ xLi ! LixAsF3Àx þ xLiF
These arsenic compounds are believed to contribute to the favorable SEI characteristics that result in greatly improved Li cycling performance for LiAsF6 electrolytes relative to comparable electrolytes with other Li salts.

A diverse range of additives have been added to electrolytes—either intentionally or accidentally as contaminants—which are often the most reactive components of the electrolyte and thus dominate the initial SEI formation even when present only
in trace amounts. The most commonly studied contaminants are H2O and O2, while CO2 has received intense focus as an additive.

3.2.3.1 H2O and HF
H2O is a frequent electrolyte contaminant. As such, many studies have been devoted to scrutinizing its inﬂuence on the Li plating morphology and cycling behavior. Small amounts of H2O are often found to improve the Li cycling CE, but an excess amount of H2O instead degrades the Li cycling CE (Malik et al. 1990; Rauh and Brummer 1977b; Aurbach and Granot 1997; Qian et al. 2015a; Selim and Bro 1974; Rauh and Brummer 1977a; Togasaki et al. 2014; Arakawa et al. 1999). When H2O is present in carbonate-based electrolytes, its reaction suppresses the solvent and anion reduction reactions due to the formation of Li2CO3 (Schechter et al. 1999; Aurbach et al. 1995b; Zaban et al. 1996; Nazri and Muller 1985c):
2ROCO2Li þ H2O ! 2ROH þ CO2 þ Li2CO3
The alcohol produced is likely to be soluble in the electrolyte. The dissolved CO2 may react with Li2O or LiOH to form Li2CO3, or alternatively with a lithium alkoxide to form a lithium alkylcarbonate species. The Li2CO3 is insoluble in aprotic solvents and thus becomes part of the SEI layer. In ether-based electrolytes, however, H2O does not react with the alkoxides formed, but it does solvate these surface species which facilitates the diffusion of the H2O to the Li surface to form LiOH and Li2O accompanied by H2 generation (Zaban et al. 1996; Nazri and Muller 1985c; Malik et al. 1990):
2H2O þ 2Li ! 2LiOH þ H2
2LiOH þ 2Li ! 2Li2O þ H2
Therefore, small amounts of H2O tend to increase the Li cycling CE for PC-based electrolytes, but decreases the CE for ether-based electrolytes (Aurbach et al. 1989).
Although the ClO4− anion is relatively stable to hydrolysis, this is not the case for PF6− and BF4− (Kanamura et al. 1995b, d; Qian et al. 2015a):
MFÀn þ H2O ! FÀ þ 2HF þ MOFnÀ3 ðM ¼ P or BÞ

The F− can then react with a Li+ cation to form LiF, while the HF can react with several other compounds present in electrolyte or SEI layer according to the following reactions:

LiOH þ HF ! LiF þ H2O Li2O þ 2HF ! 2LiF þ H2O 2Li þ 2HF ! 2LiF þ H2 ROCO2Li þ HF ! LiF þ ROCO2H Li2CO3 þ HF ! LiF þ LiHCO3 LiHCO3 þ HF ! LiF þ H2CO3

The ROCO2H and H2CO3 are likely to be soluble in the electrolyte. Thus, electrolytes with LiPF6, especially when a small amount of H2O is present, often have a compact SEI layer consisting predominantly of LiF with relatively little organic species present. It is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that reactions with the solvent are largely prevented (although this may occur if the surface passivation is effective) since the products of such solvent reactions may continuously react with HF to form soluble species (which may then inﬂuence the cathode reactions). This LiF-dominant SEI layer on Li metal results in the uniform formation of Li nuclei underneath this inorganic layer which then may grow into an aligned array of Li nanorods (which is covered by an SEI layer consisting of LiF and perhaps some Li2O) (Fig. 2.16) with a ﬂat, mirror-like surface that results in a blue texture-coloring (Qian et al. 2015a).
Kanamura and Takehara reported that the direct addition of HF (e.g., to a 1 M LiClO4-PC electrolyte) resulted in Li (plated on Ni) with a smooth, uniform deposition morphology that also had a blue color (Kanamura et al. 1994a; Takehara 1997). This is due to the formation of a thin surface coating of LiF (Kanamura et al. 1994a, 1995a, 1996, 2000; Takehara 1997; Shiraishi et al. 1997; Lee et al. 2005). The same results were obtained with electrolytes having different carbonate solvents and Li salts (Shiraishi et al. 1997). These authors indicated that the Li had a hemispherical form, but an examination of the SEM images suggests that this corresponds to the rounded tops of aligned arrays of Li nanorods (Kanamura et al. 1994a, 1995a; Shiraishi et al. 1997, 1999a; Yoon et al. 2008), as was noted above. Despite this favorable Li deposition morphology, the Li cycling CE in the 1 M LiClO4-PC electrolyte with added HF was rather low (<90 %) (Kanamura et al. 2000; Shiraishi and Kanamura 1998; Shiraishi et al. 1999a; Yoon et al. 2008). This low efﬁciency may be attributed to a coating on the surface of each of the nanorods growing outward. After stripping the Li, a thick residual ﬁlm remained on the electrode. This negatively impacted the subsequent depositions due to the accumulation of this interphasial layer (Shiraishi et al. 1999b; Yoon et al. 2008).

3.2.3.2 O2 and N2
The addition of dissolved O2 tended to improve the Li cycling efﬁciency (Malik et al. 1990; Koch and Young 1978). In aprotic electrolytes, the reduction of O2 (above 1.8 V vs. Li/Li+—Fig. 3.12) results in a metastable superoxide ion or a peroxide (Pletcher et al. 1994; Aurbach et al. 1991b; Aurbach 1989a)

O2 þ Li ! LiO2
O2 þ 2Li ! Li2O2
According to the recent Li-air battery studies, LiO2 is reactive to carbonate solvents to Li2CO3 and lithium alkylcarbonate, while it is relatively stable in ethers and has certain solubility. These oxides should be highly insoluble in carbonate and ether solvents.
The reactivity of dissolved N2 toward Li at low potential was studied in N2saturated 2MeTHF solutions (Malik et al. 1990). The reactivity to form Li3N was rather low suggesting that N2 is probably not reactive enough to compete with other solution components for the SEI formation. Only modest improvements to the CE were noted for an N2-saturated 1 M LiAsF6-THF electrolyte (Koch and Young 1978). Another study in which Li was exposed to dried air (i.e., a dry room), however, determined that the surface coating consisted of both Li2CO3 and Li3N which improved the Li cycling CE relative to Li stored in Ar (Momma et al. 2011). Exposing Li directly to N2 gas also produced a Li3N layer which, when cycled in a 1 M LiPF6-EC/DMC (1/1) electrolyte, resulted in stable cycling performance, suggesting that the Li3N layer was durable, but the Li cycling CE was low (<90 %) for this electrolyte (Wu et al. 2011).

3.2.3.3 CO2 and SO2
Brummer et al. noted in 1977 that the addition of SO2 improved the Li cycling CE of electrolytes (Rauh and Brummer 1977a, b; Dampier and Brummer 1977). This additive, however, did not effectively passivate the Li surface and its toxicity has limited its use. The use of CO2, however, has been extensively studied as an additive. This reacts with surface species to form Li2CO3 which becomes a major surface species which, in turn, often greatly improves the Li cycling CE (Ein-Eli and Aurbach 1996; Aurbach and Chusid (Youngman) 1993; Ein Ely and Aurbach 1992; Malik et al. 1990; Osaka et al. 1997b, c; Besenhard et al. 1993; Fujieda et al. 1994; Momma et al. 1995; Gan and Takeuchi 1996). Li2CO3 is one of the most effective Li passivating species for preventing Li corrosion and the formation of dead Li (Besenhard and Eichinger 1976). Although the Li deposition morphology remains that of kinked needles, these adhere well to the electrode surface thus preventing the loss of electrical contact (Aurbach et al. 1992). Note, however, that this plating/stripping behavior will still result in the continuous buildup of an interphasial layer due to the residue from the needle-like SEI layers once the Li is stripped and then re-plated since the Li does not redeposit in the empty needle husks. In addition, excessive amounts of CO2 can degrade the CE, especially for LiAsF6-ether electrolytes, which tend to generate a stable SEI layer, resulting in a very high Li cycling CE (Malik et al. 1990; Koch and Young 1978). Of note, Aurbach et al. (1992) found that the use of Al2O3 as a drying agent for EC or PC produced CO2 and thus storage of such electrolytes over Al2O3 will increase the Li cycling CE considerably.

3.2.3.4 Other Additives
Numerous other additives have been utilized. These include nitrous oxides (e.g., N2O and CH3NO2) (Dampier and Brummer 1977; Rauh and Brummer 1977a, b; Uchiyama et al. 1987; Besenhard et al. 1993), trialkylamines (Aurbach et al. 2002a; Dan et al. 1997; Gofer et al. 1992; Herlem et al. 1996), aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, toluene, and furans/thiophenes (especially 2MF) (see Fig. 3.12) (Abraham 1985; Morita et al. 1992; Geronov et al. 1989; Goldman et al. 1989; Halpert et al. 1994; Malik et al. 1990; Matsuda 1993; Abraham et al. 1984; Dominey and Goldman 1990; Ishikawa et al. 1994; Matsuda and Morita 1989; Matsuda and Sekiya 1999; Surampudi et al. 1993; Wu et al. 2013; Saito et al. 1997; Choi et al. 2007a; Peled et al. 1989; Choi et al. 2008; Lane et al. 2010a), and reactive carbonates (ﬂuoroethylene carbonate, FEC and vinylene carbonate, VC) (Song et al. 2013a; Mogi et al. 2002c; Roberts et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Ota et al. 2004b, d). FEC, VC, and vinylethylene carbonate (VEC) (see Fig. 3.12) have also been used as single solvents for 1 M LiPF6-carbonate electrolytes which resulted in substantial differences in the Li morphology (Fig. 3.13) and comparable CE values of 97–98 % (compare with Fig. 3.3) (Ding et al. 2013a).

Salts have also been used as additives. These include salts with active cations such as multivalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, In3+, Bi3+, Al3+, Ga3+, Sn4+)
(Matsuda 1993; Aurbach et al. 2002b; Yoon et al. 2008), which are believed to
form intermetallic alloy phases with Li at the electrode surface, as well as salts with active monovalent cations such as Na+ (Gorodyskii et al. 1989; Bale 1989c; Stark et al. 2011, 2013). It is interesting to note that the phase diagram for Li–Na indicates that solid solutions are formed for all compositions that remain solid up until 92 °C, whereas the phase diagram for Li–Cs shows that these elements have almost complete immiscibility with each other in both the solid and liquid states and
that Cs melts at 28 °C (Bale 1989b, c). Lithium halides (i.e., LiF, LiBr, and LiI)

72

3 High Coulombic Efﬁciency of Lithium Plating/Stripping …

have also been used as additives (Lu et al. 2014, 2015; Ishikawa et al. 1994; Besenhard 1977). Both LiF and LiBr have a low to negligible solubility in aprotic electrolytes, but LiI has an appreciable solubility. It was suggested, however, that the I− anion absorbs on the Li surface. These halide salts cannot be further reduced, and so their presence on the Li surface may hinder or prevent reaction of the Li with other electrolyte components. Li salts with reactive anions (LiBOB, LiDFOB, and LiNO3) have also been used (Xiong et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015; Zhang 2013a), as have salts that combine these features (MgI2, AlI3, and SnI2) (Ishikawa et al. 1994; Matsuda et al. 1995; Ishikawa et al. 1997, 1999b, 2003, 2005).

3.2.4 Inﬂuence of Ionic Liquids
Many ionic liquids (ILs) with tetraalkylammonium (e.g., NR+RRR, PY1+R, and PI1+R) and tetraphosphonium (PR+RRR) cations have very high electrochemical stability windows. For example, for the N1116TFSI IL (with trimethylhexylammonium cations), this is in excess of 5 V (0–5 V vs. Li/Li+) when cycled with electrodes such as Pt, Al, or glassy carbon (Zheng et al. 2005). Notably, however, the electrochemical stability is strongly dependent on the electrode material as oxidation/reduction reactions were evident within this voltage range when Ni, Cu, and acetylene black were used instead (Zheng et al. 2005). Typically, the reductive stability of an IL is determined by the identity of the organic cation. ILs with 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium (e.g., IM102+) cations exhibit poor reductive stability due to the high reactivity of the C-2 proton on the cation’s ring (Best et al. 2010; Matsumoto et al. 2006; Sano et al. 2013). It thus follows that ILs with 1-alkyl-2,3-dimethylimidazium (e.g., IM113+) cations are more stable to reduction (although the C-4 and C-5 protons are still somewhat acidic), while tetraalkylammonium and tetraalkylphosphonium cations are the most stable (Best et al. 2010; Matsumoto et al. 2006; Seki et al. 2006b).
In general, neat tetraalkylammonium-based ILs display a reductive current in its cyclic voltammetry curve just prior to the potential at which Li plating initiates. This would suggest that these ILs are unsuitable for this application (Bhatt et al. 2010), but when a Li salt (e.g., LiBF4, LiPF6, and LiTFSI) is dissolved in an IL (with either FSI− or TFSI− anions), a substantial extension of the cathodic stability limit occurs which enables the highly reversible plating/stripping of Li metal (Best et al. 2010; Matsumoto et al. 2006). The stabilization effects for the different Li salts were found to be comparable, irrespective of the Li salt used (Girard et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2014a; Best et al. 2010). The inﬂuence of temperature on electrochemical stability is often neglected. Few available studies explore this, but one study found that as the temperature increased, the reductive stability potential range of the electrolyte contracted resulting in the overlap of the Li plating process with electrolyte degradation and thus signiﬁcant IL decomposition occurred at * 80 °C (Best et al. 2010).

3.2 Electrolyte and In Situ Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase

Howlett et al. (2004) reported that a Li cycling CE > 99 % could be achieved on a Cu electrode using a 0.5 M LiTFSI-IL electrolyte with the PY14TFSI IL up to a current density of 1.5 mA cm−2, but these measurements used an excess of initially plated Li, so the value per cycle may actually be somewhat lower. At higher current densities, kinked needle-like Li deposits formed. Nishida et al. (2013) explored the Li deposition morphology on a Ni electrode in LiTFSI-IL electrolytes with the PY1 (1O1)TFSI IL. These authors also studied the effect of LiTFSI salt concentration (Fig. 3.14). For the electrolytes with a LiTFSI concentration <1 M, aggregated dendrite clusters formed, but for more concentrated electrolytes, longer kinked needle-like deposits were evident.
A range of studies have been reported for Li anodes with electrolytes having ILs consisting of tetralkylammonium or tetraalkylphosphonium cations and either TFSI− or FSI− anions mixed with Li salts (LiTFSI, LiFSI, LiAsF6, LiPF6, LiBF4) (Sakaebe and Matsumoto 2003; Howlett et al. 2004; Seki et al. 2005, 2006a, 2008; Matsumoto et al. 2006; Fernicola et al. 2007; Vega et al. 2009; Wibowo et al. 2009; Best et al. 2010; Bhatt et al. 2010; Lane et al. 2010b; Sano et al. 2011a, b, 2012, 2013, 2014 Basile et al. 2013; Goodman and Kohl 2014; Liu et al. 2014a; Furuya et al. 2015; Girard et al. 2015). Since no solvent is present in these electrolytes, the anion plays a prominent role in the SEI formation. For example, for Li stored in a LiFSI-IL electrolyte with PY13FSI, the passivation layer contained LiF, Li2O,

LiOH, and FSI− decomposition products (Budi et al. 2012). A similar complex mixer of species was proposed for the degradation of the TFSI− anion (Howlett et al. 2004). But a signiﬁcant difference was noted when the cell was cycled as the SEI then did not contain the species present in the native Li SEI layer (i.e., Li2O, LiOH, and Li2CO3), but instead had signiﬁcant quantities of species associated with the cation (Howlett et al. 2006).
During the cycling of Li||Li symmetric cells with IL-based electrolytes, voltage instabilities were frequently noted (Basile et al. 2013; Best et al. 2010; Bhatt et al. 2010, 2012; Lane et al. 2010b). This was initially attributed to a “welding” mechanism for Li dendrites (Fig. 3.15) (Lane et al. 2010b), but later it was proposed that a Li electrode surface reorganization was instead occurring (Basile et al. 2013). This latter explanation is very plausible since a similar SEI layer disruption was proposed for the reduction in the polarization for Li plating/stripping with polymer electrolytes (Appetecchi and Passerini 2002). Unlike for a polymer electrolyte where the formation of a resistive interface is rather slow due to the lack of mobility of the electrolyte, for an IL-based electrolyte—especially one with reactive

FSI− anions or other electrolyte components—as the interphasial layer is disrupted, reactions with the exposed Li accelerate, resulting in an increase in the polarization. This buildup and disruption readily explains the chaotic polarization voltage variations during cycling.

3.2.5 Importance of Electrolyte Concentration
In recent years, use of highly concentrated electrolyte has proved to be a very efﬁcient approach to suppress Li dendrite growth and enhance the CE of Li cycling. As the salt concentration increases, there is less free (uncoordinated) solvent present in the electrolyte. Thus, the SEI composition may be more reﬂective of the anion’s reductive properties. However, in highly concentrated electrolytes there is not enough solvent available to fully coordinate the Li+ cations. Thus, cations are coordinated to solvent molecules and anions, with the anions typically coordinated to multiple Li+ cations, giving a network-like electrolyte solution structure. Just as coordinated solvent molecules are more susceptible to reduction, so too are coordinated anions.
Early work in this ﬁeld was focused on the use of concentrated electrolyte to stabilize graphite electrodes used in Li-ion batteries. Recently, it has also been used in Li metal batteries with excellent results. Because graphite has a reduction potential very close to that of a Li metal anode, general characteristics of the concentrated electrolyte used with graphite are similar to those used for Li metal anodes. Therefore, it is very useful to understand the general properties of concentrated electrolytes when they are used with graphite.
McKinnon and Dahn demonstrated in 1985 that co-intercalation of PC into layered materials intercalated with Li can be reduced with concentrated electrolytes (McKinnon and Dahn 1985). McOwen et al. (2014) used highly concentrated electrolytes containing carbonate solvents with LiTFSI to determine the inﬂuence of eliminating bulk solvent (i.e., uncoordinated to a Li+ cation) on electrolyte properties. The phase behavior of LiTFSI-EC mixtures indicates that two crystalline solvates form—LiTFSI-(EC)3 and LiTFSI-(EC)1. A Raman spectroscopic analysis of the EC solvent bands for the 3-1 and 2-1 LiTFSI- EC liquid electrolytes indicates that *86 and 95 %, respectively, of the solvent is coordinated to the Li+ cations. This extensive coordination results in signiﬁcantly improved anodic oxidation and thermal stabilities as compared with more dilute (i.e., 1 M) electrolytes. Further, while dilute LiTFSI-EC electrolytes extensively corrode the Al current collector at high potential, the concentrated electrolytes do not. Although the ionic conductivity of concentrated LiTFSI-EC electrolytes is somewhat low relative to the current state-of-the-art electrolyte formulations used in commercial Li-ion batteries, using an EC-DEC mixed solvent instead of pure EC markedly improves the conductivity.

76

3 High Coulombic Efﬁciency of Lithium Plating/Stripping …

Recently, Yamada et al. (2010, 2013, 2014a, b) have done extensive work on use
of various concentrated electrolytes to improve the stability of graphite anode under
different conditions. They found that a superconcentrated ether electrolyte can lead to ultrafast Li+ intercalation into graphite, even exceeding that in a currently used
commercial electrolyte. This discovery is important for fast-charging Li-ion bat-
teries far beyond present technologies (Yamada et al. 2013). They also investigated
the behavior of electrochemical lithium intercalation into graphite in DMSO-based
electrolytes, including lithium salt-concentrated solutions and binary solutions with
DMC. Raman spectra of these solutions showed that the solvation number of DMSO molecules toward Li+ cations (NDMSO) decreased from 4.2 in a conventional solution to around 2 in the salt-concentrated solution and the binary solution. A comparison between the behavior of graphite and the NDMSO values has clariﬁed that the NDMSO value of 3 is a criterion for determining whether the intercalation of Li+ ions or solvated Li+ ions occurs. A series of results suggests that the decrease in the solvation number of the relevant solvents toward Li+ ion can suppress the
co-intercalation of solvents into graphite (Yamada et al. 2010). They also found that
a dilute electrolyte (e.g., 1 M) of sulfoxide, ether, and sulfone results in solvent
co-intercalation and/or severe electrolyte decomposition at a graphite electrode,
whereas their superconcentrated electrolyte (e.g., > 3 M) allows for highly rever-
sible Li intercalation into graphite. A unique coordination structure in the superconcentrated solution and an anion-based inorganic SEI ﬁlm on the cycled graphite electrode have been identiﬁed which would be the origin of the reversible graphite negative electrode reaction without EC (Yamada et al. 2014a).
Yamada and Tateyama (2014) also investigated the fundamental mechanism
behind the enhanced stability of highly concentrated electrolyte toward graphite
anode. They report enhanced reductive stability of a superconcentrated acetonitrile
(AN) solution (>4 M). Applying it to a battery electrolyte, they demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, reversible Li intercalation into a graphite electrode in a reduction-vulnerable AN solvent. First-principle calculations combined with
spectroscopic analyses reveal that the peculiar reductive stability arises from modiﬁed frontier orbital characters unique to such superconcentrated solutions, in which all solvents and anions coordinate to Li+ cations to form a ﬂuid polymeric network of anions and Li+ cations. To identify the solution structure providing the unusual reductive stability with a surface ﬁlm derived from bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TFSA or TFSI), Raman spectra were obtained for LiTFSI/AN
solutions at various Li salt concentrations (Fig. 3.16a, b). In dilute solutions, a stable solvation structure around Li+ is reported to be 3- or 4-fold coordination
(Fig. 3.16c). Further increasing the Li salt concentration decreases free AN molecules and instead increases the Li+-solvating AN molecules. At 4.2 M (super-high
concentration), where unusual reductive stability was observed, there is only a peak for Li+-solvating AN molecules, indicating that all the AN molecules coordinate to Li+. A series of spectroscopic analyses show that the structure of the salt-superconcentrated solution is characterized by a ﬂuid polymeric network of mutually interacting TFSI− anions and Li+ cations in the presence of two AN molecules solvating each Li+. This peculiar structural feature is unique to such a

superconcentrated solution, and should be a clue to its modiﬁed ﬁlm-forming ability that provides unusual reductive stability.
Yamada et al. further used quantum mechanical density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulation to further elucidate the origin of the unusual reductive stability with a TFSI-derived surface ﬁlm, DFT-MD was applied to the dilute (1-LiTFSI/43-AN, 0.4 M) and superconcentrated (10-LiTFSI/20-AN, 4.2 M) LiTFSI/AN systems. Panels a and b of Fig. 3.17 show snapshots and projected density of states (PDOS) of equilibrium trajectories of the dilute solution with a fully dissociated salt and contact ion pairs (CIPs), respectively. In the dilute system with a fully dissociated salt (Fig. 3.17a), the energy levels of Li+-solvating or free AN molecules are lower than those of TFSI− anions at the lowest end of conduction bands; the LUMO is located at AN molecules. This indicates that AN molecules are predominantly reduced in a dilute LiTFSI/AN solution, which is consistent with the experimental result of continuous reductive decompositions of AN solvents in contact with Li metal, a strong reduction reagent. The situation is the same when a simple ion pair (i.e., CIP) exists in the dilute solution (Fig. 3.17b).
As for the superconcentrated solution (Fig. 3.17c), the snapshot at an equilibrium trajectory shows a polymeric network of TFSI− anions and Li+ cations: each

TFSI− anion is interacting with multiple Li+ cations to form ion pairs, which is consistent with the results of Raman analyses and totally different from those in dilute solutions. In the PDOS proﬁle (see bottom of Fig. 3.17c), TFSI− anions provide new unoccupied states at the lowest energy in the conduction bands and the energy levels of TFSI− become lower than those of AN molecules; the LUMO is located at TFSI− anions in the superconcentrated solution. The new unoccupied states are unique to such a superconcentrated solution with characteristic structural features of mutually networking TFSI− anions and Li+ cations with a small amount of solvents. The localized LUMOs at the TFSI− anions suggest that TFSI− anions, rather than AN solvents, are predominantly reduced to form a TFSI-derived surface ﬁlm on a graphite electrode in the superconcentrated electrolyte. These quantum mechanical simulations with a realistic experimental salt concentration elucidate the peculiar frontier orbital characters in a salt-superconcentrated solution and account for the formation of a TFSI-derived surface ﬁlm, which is the origin of the enhanced reductive stability that allows for reversible lithium intercalation into a graphite negative electrode.
With the successful use of highly concentrated electrolyte to enhance the stability of the electrolyte toward graphite electrode in the absence of EC, the idea of concentrated electrolyte has been used to enhance the stability of Li metal anodes

recently. Tobishima et al. (1984) studied the inﬂuence of salt concentration for LiClO4-PC/DME electrolytes up to a concentration of 3 M. The Li cycling CE plateaued at a high value of 92–93 % for 1 M and 2 M electrolytes, but decreased to 87 % for a 3 M concentration. Suo et al. (2013) reported that the use of LiTFSI-DME electrolytes up to a concentration of 7 M gave very promising Li-S
cell performance due, in part, to the suppression of Li dendrite formation. These “solvent-in-salt” electrolytes exhibit a high Li+-ion transference number (0.73), in which salt holds a dominant position in the Li+-ion transport system. It remarkably
enhances the cyclic and safety performance of next-generation high-energy
rechargeable Li batteries via an effective suppression of Li dendrite growth and
shape change in the Li metal anode. Moreover, when used in a Li-S battery, the advantage of this electrolyte is further demonstrated in that lithium polysulﬁde dissolution is inhibited, thus overcoming one of today’s most challenging technological hurdles, the “polysulﬁde shuttle phenomenon.” Consequently, a CE nearing 100 % and long cycling stability are achieved.
Recently, Qian et al., found that replacing LiTFSI with LiFSI can greatly
increase the stability of Li metal. The use of highly concentrated electrolytes
composed of DME solvents and the LiFSI salt enables the high-rate cycling of a Li
metal anode at high CE (up to 99.1 %) without dendrite growth. With 4 M LiFSI in DME as the electrolyte, a Li||Li cell can be cycled at high rate (10 mA cm−2) for more than 6000 cycles with no increase in the cell impedance, and a Li||Cu cell can be cycled at 4 mA cm−2 for more than 1000 cycles with an average CE of 98.4 %,
as shown in (Fig. 3.18). These excellent high-rate performances can be attributed to the increased solvent coordination and increased availability of Li+ concentration in
the electrolyte. The small amount of degradation that occurred during each cycle led
to the slow buildup of a black interphasial layer, but this did not lead to a change in
the polarization for the plating/stripping, suggesting that this layer did not impede the cycling to any signiﬁcant extent. Further development of this electrolyte may lead to practical applications for Li metal anodes in rechargeable batteries. The
fundamental mechanisms behind the high-rate ion exchange and stability of the
electrolytes also shed light on the stability of other electrochemical systems.

3.2.6 Self-healing Electrostatic Shield Mechanism
As we discussed in the previous sections, various approaches have been used to suppress Li dendrite formation and growth. However, most of these approaches rely on the formation of a strong layer to mechanically block the Li dendrite growth. Recently, Ding et al. developed a novel mechanism that could inﬂuence Li deposition preference to obtain a dendrite-free Li anode, which is called the self-healing electrostatic shield (SHES) mechanism (Ding et al. 2013b). This mechanism does not rely on the mechanical strength of a protection layer. Instead, it relies on an electrostatic shield formed by electrolyte additives. This layer is positively charged and ﬂoating on the tip area of potential dendrites on the surface of deposited Li ﬁlm,

but does not physically attach to the dendrite and Li ﬁlm. During the Li deposition process, this electrostatic shield will repel the incoming Li+ ions and force them to be deposited in the valley area instead of peak area of the Li ﬁlm. Once applied electric voltage is turned off, this charged cloud will dissipate and does not form a permanent ﬁlm on the Li surface.
Figure 3.19 illustrates the SHES mechanism to prevent Li dendrite formation. According to the Nernst equation, it is possible to ﬁnd certain metal cations (M+) that have an effective reduction potential lower than that of Li+ if the M+ has a standard redox potential close to those of Li+ and a chemical activity much lower than that of Li+ (Ding et al. 2013b). For example, cesium ion (Cs+) at a low concentration of 0.01 M has an effective reduction potential of −3.144 V, which is lower than that of Li+ at 1.0 M concentration (−3.040 V). As a result, in a mixed electrolyte where the additive Cs+ concentration is much lower than the Li+

concentration, Cs+ additives will not be deposited at the Li deposition potential and do not form thin layers of Li alloys at the electrode surface.
As shown in Fig. 3.19, at the initial stage of deposition, both Li+ ions and the Cs+ additive cations are adsorbed on the surface of the substrate (e.g., Li). When the applied voltage (Va) is slightly lower than the reduction potential of a Li ion (ELi/Li+) but higher than the reduction potential of the Cs+ (ECs/Cs+), i.e. ELi/Li+ > Va > ECs/Cs+, then Li deposits on the substrate surface (Fig. 3.19a). Due to the unevenness of the substrate surface or other ﬂuctuations in the system, some Li protuberant tips will unavoidably be formed at the substrate surface (Fig. 3.19b).

82

Then a higher electron-charge density appears at the newly formed Li protuberance
that attracts more Li ions from the electrolyte and deposits more on the tip than on
other sites, thus forming the Li dendrite as would happen in the conventional electrolyte. However, in the SHES mechanism, more non-Li Cs+ cations will also
be adsorbed on the tip by electrostatic attraction force at the same time (Fig. 3.19c).
When the adsorbed Li ions deposit on this tip continuously, the number of Li ions around the tip decreases signiﬁcantly but more and more non-Li cations that do not electrochemically reduce at this potential will accumulate and surround the tip
surface. Then a positively charged electrostatic shield is automatically formed by
adsorbed non-Li cations on the Li tip (Fig. 3.19d). Due to the charge repelling and steric hindrance effect of the non-Li cation shield, it is more difﬁcult for Li ions to adsorb and deposit on such a tip. Li ions have to deposit at other sites with lower
non-Li cation adsorption ratios. As a result, the continuous Li growth on this tip
(dendrite root) is stopped. It is reasonable to believe that there should be a lot of tips
forming on the Li surface, but no tips would grow exceptionally as shown in
Fig. 3.19e. Eventually, a smooth Li surface could be formed as illustrated in
Fig. 3.19f; then this self-healing process will repeat itself. In fact, Fig. 3.19 is a simpliﬁed illustration of a Li deposition process with SHES additives. In practice, an SEI layer will always form on the surface of Li metal once it is in contact with electrolyte. Therefore, Cs+ ions will accumulate on the outside of the SEI layer and quickly form an electrostatic shield and prevent ampliﬁcation of Li dendrite growth.
The SHES additive approach is different from those of inorganic additives (including Mg2+, Al3+, Zn2+, Ga3+, In3+, and Sn2+) used in previous studies (Matsuda
et al. 1991); (Matsuda 1993). These additive metal ions are consumed during each
Li deposition and their effectiveness will soon fade with increasing cycles.
However, in the proposed SHES mechanism, the additive cations will not be consumed and can last for long-term cycling. This prediction has been veriﬁed by chemical analysis of the deposited ﬁlms.
Figure 3.20 shows SEM images of the deposited Li ﬁlms on copper substrates with different Cs+ concentrations. In the control electrolyte without the CsPF6 additive, Li dendrite formation is clearly observed in the deposited Li ﬁlm (see Fig. 3.20a). Even at very low Cs+ concentrations (0.005 M), Li dendrite formation is signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 3.20b). When the Cs+ concentration is increased to 0.05 M, the dendrite formation is completely eliminated, resulting in a very distinct
improvement (Fig. 3.20c). Further investigation indicated that even if a dendritic Li ﬁlm was initially formed during Li deposition, it could be smoothened if further deposition was conducted in the electrolyte containing Cs+ additive. In addition to Cs+, Rb+ also exhibits a lower effective reduction potential when its concentration is much lower than that of Li+. Not surprisingly, RbPF6 was also able to suppress Li dendrite growth although it is not as effective as CsPF6. Unlike other cations, reported in the previous work, that will form part of the SEI layer (Matsuda et al. 1991) (Matsuda 1993), SHES additives (Cs+, Rb+, etc.) do not form part of the SEI layer as veriﬁed by several trace analysis techniques (Ding et al. 2013b).

Finally, it is necessary to indicate that although the SHES mechanism has addressed the dendritic morphology problem encountered during Li deposition, the CE of Li deposition in the electrolytes used in the above work is still relatively low (*76 % in case of 1 M LiPF6/PC). Further optimization of electrolyte solvent, salt, and additives have increased CE of Li deposition/stripping to more than 98 % and still retained dendrite-free morphology of the deposited Li ﬁlms, which is required for long-term cycling operation of Li metal anodes.

3.3 Ex Situ Formed Surface Coating
Rather than using the electrolyte components to dictate the composition of in situ formed SEI layers on the Li, a wide variety of ex situ surface treatments and polymer coatings have been applied to the Li anode prior to cell assembly. Examples include: N2 gas (generating Li3N as noted above) (Wu et al. 2011), cyclopentadienyldicarbonyl iron (II) silanes (Fp-silanes) (Neuhold et al. 2014), Al2O3 (Kazyak et al. 2015), carbon thin ﬁlms (amorphous, nanostructured, and diamond-like) (Zhang et al. 2014c; Bouchet 2014; Zheng et al. 2014; Arie and Lee 2011), Naﬁon (Song et al. 2015), polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF)-Li2CO3 (Chung et al. 2003), PVDF-HFP (Jang et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2006; Osaka et al. 1999), PVDF-HFP-Al2O3 (Lee et al. 2015), polyacetylene (Belov et al. 2006), poly (vinylene carbonate-co-acrylonitrile) (P(VC-co-AN)) layer (Choi et al. 2013), plasma-polymerized 1,1-diﬂuoroethene (Takehara et al. 1993), and crosslinked Kynar 2801-1,6-hexanediol diacrylate semi-IPN (interpenetrating polymer network) (Choi et al. 2003, 2004a, b). This last coating transformed the Li from a needle-like deposit to a nodular morphology (Fig. 3.21)—despite the use of the same electrolyte [i.e., 1 M LiClO4-EC/PC (1/1)]—as the amount of the crosslinking agent (i.e., 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate) was increased.
Recently, Zheng et al. designed an interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres for stable Li metal anodes (Zheng et al. 2014). They developed a template synthesis

method for fabricating the hollow carbon nanopheres, using vertical deposition of polystyrene nanoparticles (Fig. 3.22a). A colloidal multilayer opal structure is formed on Cu foil by slowly evaporating a 4 % aqueous solution of carboxylated polystyrene particles. The highly monodisperse polystyrene nanoparticles form a close-packed thin ﬁlm with long range order (Fig. 3.22b). The polystyrene nanoparticles are coated with a thin ﬁlm of amorphous carbon using ﬂash-evaporation of carbon ﬁbers (Fig. 3.22c). The samples are then heated in a tube furnace to 400 °C under an inert atmosphere, forming hollow carbon nanopheres on the Cu substrate (Fig. 3.22e). TEM characterization shows that the carbon wall has a thickness of $ 20 nm (Fig. 3.22f). The hemispherical carbon nanospheres are interconnected to form a thin ﬁlm, which can be peeled off the Cu surface easily. Mechanical ﬂexibility is important in accommodating the volumetric

change of Li deposition and dissipating the stress exerted on the Li protection layer during cycling. A digital camera image (Fig. 3.22d) and SEM image (Fig. 3.22g) show that the carbon nanosphere thin ﬁlm can achieve a bending radius of $ 20 m. They demonstrate that coating the lithium metal anode with such a monolayer of interconnected amorphous hollow carbon nanospheres helps isolate the Li metal depositions and facilitates the formation of a stable SEI. The CE of Li cycling with such an ex situ formed surface layer is $ 99 % for more than 150 cycles. This result indicates that nanoscale interfacial engineering could be a promising strategy to tackle the intrinsic problems of lithium metal anodes.

3.4 Mechanical Blocking and Solid Electrolytes

Commercial separators for Li-ion batteries tend to be thin (<30 µm), microporous polyoleﬁn membranes made from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene, or laminates of PE/polypropylene (Arora and Zhang 2004). Such separators are frequently also used when testing cells with Li anodes. It has been proposed, however, that dendrite formation can be inhibited by incorporating a solid separator/electrolyte, especially one with an acceptable ionic conductivity and a high shear modulus of approximately twice that of Li (i.e., 9 GPa) (Monroe and Newman 2005; Ferrese and Newman 2014).

3.4.1 Solid Polymer Electrolytes
Early work with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and Li metal anodes focused on Li salt-PEO salt and related electrolytes (Gauthier et al. 1985b; Xue et al. 2015). The relatively low conductivity of such electrolytes and their tendency to crystallize generally required the cells to be plasticized via the inclusion of a liquid electrolyte or instead operated at elevated temperature (e.g., 75–90 °C) (Appetecchi et al. 1998). Using a polyether copolymer with an added 1–3 M LiClO4-EC/PC (1/1) electrolyte, Matsui and Takeyama used a visual study of the Li-plasticized polymer electrolyte interface to examine the effects of the electrolyte composition on the Li deposition morphology (Matsui and Takeyama 1995). The solid electrolytes that most effectively suppressed Li dendrites were those with a lower liquid electrolyte content ( 70 %) and that were stiff and elastic (e.g., with a molecular weight > 16,000 before crosslinking).
Unplasticized polyether electrolytes are generally found to exhibit a low Li/SPE interfacial resistance that remains relatively stable over time, even upon storage at elevated temperature (Appetecchi et al. 1998; Appetecchi and Passerini 2002; Fauteux 1993). Importantly, upon discharging the Li anode, the passivation layer formed at this interface is disrupted as indicated by the Li plating/stripping overvoltage dropping to a low value (Appetecchi and Passerini 2002). The ionic resistance of this layer, however, increased substantially with decreasing temperature ( 65 °C) due to the crystallization of some of the PEO (Tm * 65 °C) (Appetecchi and Passerini 2002). This prevents self-discharge and other parasitic reactions during prolonged storage at ambient temperature, while the rapid disruption of the layer after a few initial cycles at elevated temperature enables the cells to perform well even after prolonged storage periods. The cell assembly procedure (including hot lamination) used for the Li/SPE interface was found to be critical for determining the stability of the interface over time (Appetecchi et al. 2000). In situ attenuated total reﬂectance FTIR measurements have indicated that

electrodeposited Li reacts with the PEO in a LiClO4-PEO electrolyte to form alkoxides (ROLi) (Ichino et al. 1991), similar to the reaction of Li with glymes (Aurbach and Granot 1997) and THF:
ÀÀCH2OCH2ÀÀ þ Li ! ÀÀCH2OLi þ other products
After an initial fast reaction period, further reaction with polyethers is relatively slow (Lisowska-Oleksiak 1999). For SPEs containing LiBETI, the interfacial resistance was found to proportionally depend upon the salt concentration (at open circuit) (Appetecchi and Passerini 2002). This indicates that the salt may have a key role in the electrode passivation (either by reacting directly with the Li metal or inﬂuencing the reaction of the PEO with the Li). Evaluations of Li surfaces exposed to polyether network polymers (NPs) containing either LiTFSI or LiBF4 indicated that the Li-polymer electrolyte interfacial resistance decreased and then became relatively stable for the electrolyte with LiTFSI, but the resistance grew continuously and became very large for the LiBF4-containing electrolyte (Ismail et al. 2001). XPS indicated that the SEI layers formed in the LiTFSI electrolyte were relatively thin with TFSI− components present at the solution interface (either due to adsorbed or degraded anions), while the layers formed with the LiBF4 electrolyte were thicker and contained much more LiF (Fig. 3.23) (Ismail et al. 2001). These results are analogous to what is obtained for liquid ether electrolytes in which the high stability of the ether solvent results in SEI compositions that are governed by the anion reactions.
Contrary to what was initially believed, Li dendrites do form in polymer electrolytes (Fig. 3.24a–c) (Brissot et al. 1998, 1999c, d; Dollé et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2010a, b, 2011b; Wang et al. 2012). To improve the ionic conductivity and restrict

Li dendrite growth in polymer electrolytes, the polymers have been crosslinked (Khurana et al. 2014; Ueno et al. 2011), inorganic particle ﬁllers have been added (Appetecchi et al. 1998, 1999; Zhang et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2010a; Kim et al. 2013c) and ILs have been incorporated (Shin et al. 2003, 2005a, b, 2006; Cheng et al. 2007; Choi et al. 2007b, 2011; Kim et al. 2007a, 2010a Zhu et al. 2008; Appetecchi et al. 2010, 2011; Balducci et al. 2011; Yun et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Wetjen et al. 2013; Swiderska-Mocek and Naparstek 2014; de Vries et al. 2015). Li cycling CE values >95 % were reported for cells with SPEs with and without ﬁllers, and the cells could be cycled for many hundreds of cycles at elevated temperature (e.g., 90 °C) (Appetecchi et al. 1998, 1999, 2000; Appetecchi and Passerini 2002; Gauthier et al. 1985a). The addition of ILs to SPEs enabled the operating temperature to be lowered to 30–40 °C and reduced the tendency for Li dendrites to form and penetrate the SPE (Fig. 3.24d–i) (Shin et al. 2003, 2005b; Liu et al. 2010b). The inclusion of both an inorganic ﬁller and IL did enable repeated Li plating/stripping cycles without dendrite formation (Liu et al. 2011b).
