However, such a long-standing result does not hold for entanglement decay. This was discovered (16) by examining entanglement evolution of a set of X-form mixed-state matrices (Eq. S3) with d = 0, where d is the probability that both qubits are in their ground states. Straightforward calculations for the entire class are shown by the diagrams in Fig. 3, illustrating two qubits exposed together to amplitude noise as well as phase noise. The top two time-dependent curves show that the application of either noise separately allows long-running entanglement decay of the half-life type (no ESD). By contrast, the bottom curve reaches zero in a finite time. That is, the combined effect of the two noises causes ESD. The caption explains the colored squares. This illustrates the “supervulnerability” of paired-qubit entanglement when attacked by different independent noises. This result is universal in the sense that it continues to hold (16) even if the two noises attack one of the qubits but not the other, and also if each of the two qubits is remotely attacked by just one of the noises.

from disentangled states. By imposing the right interactions almost anything can be made to happen, but we are concerned with evolution of joint information in a pure sense and focus on two-party entanglement that evolves without mutual interaction or communication.
The same two-atom situation shown in Fig. 1 can be made relevant to anti-ESD. In solving for the surface of solutions plotted in Fig. 2, the cavities were taken as fully overdamped, so that any photon emitted by either atom was irreversibly absorbed by the walls, but they could also be treated as undamped mirror-like cavities, such as used in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model for lightatom interactions (32). This situation produces a periodic sequence of perfect rebirths of atom AB entanglement (33, 34). An early mathematical model of two-qubit evolution (11) can be interpreted as treating an underdamped cavity and also shows rebirths.
The panels in the top row of Fig. 4 show rebirth scenarios. They occur for states that are initially of the cat type, such that both atoms are excited and both are un-excited at the same time. The cat-type bracket for them is
Fa ¼ ½ðþþÞcos a ⇔ ð−−Þsin a ð2Þ
where different values of sine and cosine produce the different curves in the figure (35).
Starting from the photon vacuum state in each cavity, the JC-type evolution will permit only zero or one photon to reside in each cavity at any later time, so each of the two modes is a two-state system (a qubit), and counting the two atoms there are now four qubits on hand. This provides six concurrences that can be computed: CAB, Cab, CAb, CaB, CAa, and CBb, where the capital letters identify atoms and the small letters identify the photons in cavity modes a or b. Concurrence is defined only for pairs of qubits, not quartets of them, so the label CAB implies that the a and b degrees of freedom are not available to observation and have been ignored (technically, have been traced out), and for photon concurrence Cab the atomic A and B properties are traced out, and so on.
This idealized model provides a convenient framework to analyze entanglement in a simplified but still multi-qubit framework. As shown in the top half of Fig. 4, ESD takes place for atom concurrence (in the left panel, almost all CAB curves reach zero and remain zero for finite times). However, in the right panel, the photon concurrence Cab behaves in a manner opposite to that of CAB, showing anti-ESD. That is, initially Cab is zero, but it immediately begins to grow. The photons jointly experience entanglement “sudden birth,” but this is followed by ESD a half cycle later. All of this occurs via pure “informatics,” i.e., without energy exchange or other interaction between the sites.
The reason for the rebirths is obvious—the photons emitted cannot really get lost among the few joint states available. If a larger number of cavity modes would be provided, a longer time would be needed for a rebirth to be complete, and

as a limiting case, the cavities producing the curves in Fig. 2 have an infinite number of modes, so the lost quantum correlation cannot be reborn in any finite time. If there are enough states available in one mode, as is the case for coherent-state mode preparation, then ESD and true long-time revivals are also predicted (36).
What Are the Future Prospects?
Quantum memory banks. Clearly, ESD can be largely ignored, to a first approximation, when desirable quantum operations can be manipulated

issues also include the use of external fields to manipulate qubit states (37) as in gate operations, to create transient decoherence-free subspaces, as mentioned already. A qualitatively different route to combat decoherence specifically of the ESD type is illustrated in Fig. 2. Two evolution tracks are highlighted to show that for qubits prepared with the same value of initial entanglement, their concurrences may evolve very differently. In that illustration, the right track is subject to ESD, while the left one is not. Decoherence per se is not avoided, because the non-ESD track shows steady

Fig. 4. Entanglement birth, death, and rebirth. [Adapted from (35)] In the bottom pair of panels the rise and fall of AB entanglement is exactly compensated by the fall and rise of ab entanglement. This is not the case in the top pair of panels, but a more subtle form of compensation still occurs, as reported in (35). It involves not concurrence but the auxiliary variable Q(t) defined in Eqs. 1 and S4.

at sufficiently high speed. The key goal of memory is opposite to that of speed, i.e., to preserve quantum state features semi-indefinitely. Quantum memory networks will be sensitive to the consequences if ESD occurs. ESD will probably have to be taken into account if practical versions of quantum memories are built to operate in mixed-state configurations.
Disentanglement control. Over a given noisy channel, it appears that some entangled states may be more robust against the influence of noise than others. To control decoherence optimally, it will be useful to learn how to identify the robust states separately from the fragile ones. Control

dissipation, but it always remains finite. Other examples of this are known, and in some cases a purely local operation (i.e., a manipulation of only one of the two entangled qubits) can be undertaken to change the state matrix r without changing its degree of entanglement, but in a way that switches the evolution trajectory from ESD to non-ESD (38), effectively putting it on a half-life track as in the figure. Similar studies (39) have examined the effect of local operations at intermediate stages of evolution. Use of this method requires detailed knowledge of the state matrix r, which may not be practical, particularly at times late in the evolution.

Entanglement invariants. Entanglement flow in small reservoirs has led to the recent discovery of entanglement “invariants” (35) by inspection of the curves in the bottom row of Fig. 4, which repeats the top row except that a slightly different cat state is used for the atoms initially:
Ya ¼ ½ðþ−Þcos a ⇔ ð−þÞsin a ð3Þ
In the bottom left panel of Fig. 4, it appears that each AB atomic concurrence curve is compensated at all times by the corresponding ab photonic concurrence curve in the right panel, one going up as the other falls.
In fact, exact compensation can be confirmed analytically (35), but one notes that the same behavior does not appear in the top-row curves in Fig. 4, where there is no perfect compensation of ab for AB. For example, it is easy to see that the AB and ab red curves can be zero at the same time. A natural question is, where does the missing information go in that case? Because the two-site JC model is unitary, preservation of all four-qubit information is guaranteed, so it should be located “somewhere.” Careful examination shows that concurrence is not conserved, but rather Q(t) is conserved, spread among all six different types in that case (35).
This identification of four-particle memory flow channels is unusual and clearly deserves future examination (40, 41). One can say about these invariants that they emerge only from a kind of analytic continuation of the bipartite concurrence function C(t) to un-physically negative values, which is permitted via Q(t). The entanglement flow issue (42) is also related to, and appears to expand considerably, the theory associated with entanglement swapping, which is under active exploration, and has been realized with particle pairs from independent sources (43).
Non-Markovian noises. Dissipative entanglement evolution is critically dependent on the types of the noises acting on the system. Markov environments are those for which a noise signal has no self-correlation over any time interval, and under Markov conditions noise typically results in a quantum irreversible process. Non-Markovian noise arising from a structured environment or from strong coupling appears to be more fundamental (44, 45). Recent studies have suggested that correlated noises may cause new difficulties in using quantum error correction codes (46) and dynamic decoupling (47). Although some progress has been made, extending the current research on ESD into physically relevant non-Markovian situations remains a challenge. High-Q cavity QED and quantum dot systems are two possible experimental venues.
Qutrits and beyond. Many-qubit entanglement and entanglement of quantum systems that are not qubits (i.e., those having more than two states) is largely an open question, and one that is embarrassing in a sense, because the question has been open since quantum mechanics was invented in the 1920s. There is still no known finite algo-

rithm for answering the simple-seeming question of whether a given mixed state is entangled or not, if it refers to more than two systems, and it is answerable for two mixed-state systems only in the case of pairs of qubits (as we have been discussing) and the case of one qubit and one qutrit (a three-state system such as spin-1). Investigation into ESD of qubit-qutrit systems has begun (48, 49), but generalizations to many-qubit systems are daunting tasks due to both technical and conceptual difficulties (7–9).
Topological approach. N-party entanglement dynamics will presumably become simpler to predict if a computable entanglement measure for a mixed state of more than two qubits can be discovered. However, an alternative approach is to avoid dynamics through topological analysis (50). One now knows (51, 52) that ESD is necessary (i.e., must occur) in arbitrary N-party systems of noninteracting qubits if they are exposed to thermal noise at any finite T > 0 temperature. The steady state of any noninteracting N-qubit system has a neighborhood in which every state is separable. In this case, any prearranged subsystem entanglement will inevitably be destroyed in a finite time. This is a universal result showing how entanglement evolves in the absence of external noise control.
Clearly, the holy grail for research on entanglement dynamics is to find an efficient real-time technique for tracking and controlling the entanglement evolution of a generic many-qubit system. Another important open question is to determine a generic method for direct experimental registration of entanglement, for which there is no current answer. We believe that many surprising results are awaiting discovery.

the ability to encode oppositeness that goes further than the awake-asleep dichotomy of the cats or the heads-tails dichotomy of coins. One extension is the anti-alignment of the hands of a clock, not uniquely found at 6:00, but realized also at different angles of the hands, at approximately 7:05, 8:10, etc. Orthogonal photon polarizations, which may be oriented to any direction, extend the concept to continuous “opposites,” exploited by Clauser and Freedman in their famous experiment showing quantum violation of a Bell Inequality (54). 22. Matrix encoding of the entanglement is more complicated than the bracket notation used for the cats, but it is important because we want to allow for more possibilities, which can be visualized by thinking that any of the four joint state labels ++, +−, −+, or −− can be correlated with itself or any other, making 16 basic correlation labels, and these are conventionally arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. This is the density matrix r referred to in the text. See the Supporting Online Material for an example, and a sketch of the theory of time evolution of the density matrix in a noisy environment. 23.
