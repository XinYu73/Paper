SPIN ENTANGLEMENT IN AN -ELECTRON…

Abstract

We investigate spin entanglement in many-electron systems within the framework of density functional theory. We show that the entanglement length, which is extracted from the spatial dependence of the local concurrence, is a sensitive indicator of atomic shells and reveals the character, covalent or metallic, of chemical bonds. These findings shed light on the remarkable success of modern density functionals, which tacitly employ the entanglement length as a variable. This opens the way to further research on entanglement-based functionals.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.

    Solid lines represent the concurrence of the Fermi gas for different values (represented with different colors) of the Wigner-Seitz radius a.u.). Dashed lines and bullets represent the approximate expressions of the concurrence given in Eqs. () and (), respectively.
