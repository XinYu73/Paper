Abstract

A quantum system consisting of two subsystems is separable if its density matrix can be written as ρ = Σ A w A ρ ′ A ⊗ ρ ' ' A , where ρ ′ A and ρ ' ' A are density matrices for the two subsystems, and the positive weights w A satisfy Σ w A = 1 . In this Letter, it is proved that a necessary condition for separability is that a matrix, obtained by partial transposition of ρ, has only non-negative eigenvalues. Some examples show that this criterion is more sensitive than Bell's inequality for detecting quantum inseparability.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.
