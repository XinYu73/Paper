Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya-like interaction in
ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics
Hong Jian Zhao   1, Peng Chen   1 ✉, Sergey Prosandeev1, Sergey Artyukhin2 and Laurent Bellaiche   1 ✉
The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) between two magnetic moments mi and mj is of the form Dij  ðmi ´ mjÞ. It originates from spin–orbit coupling, and is at the heart of fascinating phenomena involving non-collinear magnI etism, such as magnetic topological defects (for example, skyrmions) as well as spin–orbit torques and magnetically driven ferroelectricity, that are of significant fundamental and technological interest. In sharp contrast, its electric counterpart, which is an electric DMI characterized by its D0ij strength and describing an interaction between two polar displacements ui and uj, has rarely been considered, despite the sItriking possibility that it could also generate new features associated with non-collinear patterns of electric dipoles. Here we report first-principles simulations combined with group theoretical symmetry analysis which not only demonstrate that electric DMI does exist and has a one-to-one correspondence with its magnetic analogue, but also reveals a physical source for it. These findings can be used to explain and/or design phenomena of possible technological importance in ferroelectrics and multiferroics.

The magnetic Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI)— arising from spin–orbit coupling between mi and mj pairs of dipole moments via HDM = Dij ⋅ (mi × mj) (refs. 1,2)—is a key factor driving various fascinating phenomena, including non-collinear magnetism (for example, magnetic topological defects such as skyrmions3–5, vortices6,7, merons5,8,9, as well as spin–orbit torques10) and magnetically driven ferroelectricity11,12, that are of great fundamental and technological interest. However, the electric DMI (D0ij) coupling the polar displacements ui and uj, which is the counI terpart of magnetic DMI, has rarely been evoked, even though it can also generate new features associated with non-collinear electric dipolar patterns and thus may, for example, also lead to a revisitation or generalization of the laws of electricity and magnetism13–27. It is not even clear whether or not an electric DMI exists, although, based solely on symmetry arguments, its existence has been recently hinted28. In fact, the electric DMI is usually thought to have no physical grounds, unlike spin–orbit coupling for the magnetic DMI19. Here we use first-principles simulations and group theoretical symmetry analysis to investigate whether or not the electric DMI exists. In particular, we not only provide evidence that the electric DMI does exist but also reveal a physical source for it. By investigating the well-known class of materials formed by ABO3 perovskites, we obtained invariants giving rise to non-collinear (anti)ferroelectricity that suggest a one-to-one correspondence between Dij and D0ij. We also identified the underlying factors governing such non-coIllinear alignment of electric dipoles.
Non-collinear magnetism in perovskites driven by magnetic DMI
Let us focus on ABO3 perovskites and start by recalling that recent works have suggested that a specific magnetic DMI can occur there, involving the tilting of oxygen octahedra (Supplementary Discussion I)29,30. Technically, such a DMI can, for example, result in an energy given by ΔE ∝ ωR ⋅ (G × F), where ωR is the anti-phase tilting of the BO6 octahedra and F and G are the ferromagnetic (Γ point) and G-type antiferromagnetic (R point) vectors,

respectively29,30. Note that the K vectors and the corresponding modulations are defined in Supplementary Table I. This proposed spin–orbit-driven energy explains in a simple and straightforward way the spin-canting-driven weak ferromagnetism superimposed on the dominating G-type antiferromagnetism in various types of materials including rare-earth orthoferrites31 and other transition-metal-based perovskites32, such as chromites, manganates, titanates and halides.

Mechanisms for non-collinear dipole patterns

Our basic starting idea is to search for electric DMIs in ABO3 perovskites that are also mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. We

first employ group theory to obtain trilinear coupled invariants of

the form ∑αβγϵαβγωαQ1,βQ2,γ, involving ωα (in-phase ωM or anti-phase ωR tiltings along the α-Cartesian direction) as well as Q1,β and Q2,γ, which are two kinds of ferroelectric or antiferroelectric motions for

A or B ions along the β and γ directions, respectively. ϵαβγ is the Levi– Civita symbol. As summarized in Table 1 and sketched in Fig. 1, we

have discovered eight such possible couplings with α, β and γ being

different from each other, which we denote by Ei (i = 1–8). We also

foundPfour form αβγ

additional ϵαβγ ωαQ1;δ

couplings (denoted Q2;δ0 but with ðδ; δ0

by Ei with i = 9–12) of the Þ being (β,α), (α,β), (γ,α)

or (α,γI)—that is, for which one subscIript of a Q mode is identical

to that of the pseudo-vector characterizing the tilting of the oxygen

octahedra. These 12 mechanisms can be linked with electric DMIs,

and thus can generate non-collinear patterns of electric dipoles. Six

other couplings (denoted as Ei with i = 13–18) were discovered as byproducts (Supplementary Table II) and have the analytical form

∑αβγϵαβγωαQ1,βQ2,β—that is, the index of the two Q modes is identical. Note that in Table 1, as well throughout the manuscript and the Supplementary Information, the quantity dKα is defined and widely used to denote the symmetrized displacemI ents (along the α

direction) within the d (d = A or B) sublattice and associated with a

within the B sublattice; similarly, AMy z indicates displacements of

A ions along the y direction, whichI reverse signs between nearest

neighbours within the A sublattice inside any xy plane and remain

unchanged when moving along the z direction. To further check the

validity of these energies, we take BiAlO3 as our platform and perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to extract ionic

forces. For instance, let us start from the cubic phase, and impose a fixed anti-phase tilting of ∼8° about the z axis (ωRz ) for the AlO6 octahedra and create and then vary the strength Iand sign of the

BRx antiferroelectric motions (associated with Al sublattice). These DIFT calculations give rise to symmetrized homogeneous (that is,

associated with the Γ point) forces along the y axis, acting on Al

and Such

Bi (denoted by types of forces

FΓy;A) sublattices, and linear arIe precisely those expected

from tIhe first and seventh energies shown in Table 1, respectively.

Incidentally, this first energy thus indicates that a non-zero and

homogeneous y component of the displacement of the B ions can

be superimposed on x displacements of the B ions within a G-type

antiferroelectricity, and therefore resemble the spin-canted weak

ferromagnetism known to coexist with a predominant G-type anti-

ferromagnetism in, for example, rare-earth orthoferrites30–33; in this

way we can thus begin to demonstrate that there is an electric DMI

that is analogous to the magnetic one. Furthermore, we conducted

various types of DFT simulations to confirm that all the interaction

terms indicated in Table 1 are indeed valid. For instance, Fig. 2b

shows that the fifth and eighth terms are applicable, while the rele-

vance of the other energies is revealed in Supplementary Discussion

II. We also check our energies based on DFT by fixing the in-phase

or anti-phase tiltings to, for example, ∼11.3° or ∼4.6°. The corre-

sponding DFT results further confirm these energies. Note that the

tiltings of ∼4.6°, ∼8° or ∼11.3° are arbitrary choices and have no

deeper meaning.

We now check if some of these energies can explain the non-

collinear dipole patterns that have been previously documented.

The detailed analysis for some examples is shown in Supplementary

Discussion III. We noticed that several perovskite oxides (for

example, SrTiO3 (ref. 34), BaMnO3 (ref. 34), YMnO3 (ref. 34), BiFeO3 (refs. 34–36), PbTiO3 (ref. 36), BiFeO3–PbTiO3 superlattices36 and rare-earth ferrites37) were predicted, via DFT simulations, to exhibit

an unusual Pmc21 phase under tensile strain. This Pmc21 phase is ferroelectric with a polarization pointing along the pseudo-cubic

[110] direction, and also has Mz-point modulated antiferroelectric A and B site ionic motions along the pseudo-cubic [−110] direc-

tion, thereby generating an overall zig-zag pattern of cation dis-

placements35. It also possesses in-phase tiltings along the z direction

(ωMz z)35, as detailed in Supplementary Discussion III. One can eas-

ilyI demonstrate that our E5, E8 and E14 energies naturally reproduce

and thus explain the dipolar patten of the Pmc21 phase, as shown in

Fig. 3a,b. Another example is the experimentally synthesized BiInO3

(ref. 38) which presents a Pna21 phase with in pseudo-cubic notation: polarization (for

the following example, AΓz),

distortions anti-phase

tiltings (ωRx and ωRy ) and other distortions such as inI-phase tilting

and y directions automatically induce a non-collinear ferroelectricity, which naturally originates from E7 (see Fig. 3c,d).

The existence of electric DMI
In fact, one can easily show that E1, E5, E7 and E8 lead to non-collinear ferroelectrics, while the remaining energies in Table 1 result in non-collinear antiferroelectricity. In fact, it is straightforward to demonstrate that the ‘non-collinear ferroelectric or antiferroelectric’ Ei energies, with i = 1–8, essentially have the same form as those recently proposed for non-collinear magnetism (for example, refs. 29,30), that is:

responsible for some non-collinear magnetism via the dependency of Dij on oxygen octahedral tiltings proposed in refs. , 29,30 can thus naturally be extended to ferroelectrics and related systems. In
other words, an electric DMI coupling the i- and j-site displacement pairs by D0ij  ðui ´ ujÞ, for which D0ij is dependent on oxygen octahedral tiltinIgs as well, indeed exists.IMoreover, and as detailed in Supplementary Discussion IV, it is straightforward to use the Ei energies, with i = 1–12, to determine the explicit dependence of the DMI coefficients, D0ij, on anti-phase and in-phase tiltings for B−B and A−B pairs in peIrovskites.

One-to-one correspondence between magnetic and electric DMIs
Let us now solely consider symmetry. A detailed analysis in Supplementary Discussion V shows that the Si × Sj and ui × uj transform identically under all symmetry elements of three-dimensional Euclidean space and of course the symmetry elements of space groups of crystals, because the latter is a subset of the former. Consequently, Dij ⋅ (Si × Sj) and D0ij  ðui ´ ujÞ are both allowed by symmetry; one-to-one correspIondence between magnetic and electric DMIs can be established (Supplementary Discussion V). As a result, any DMI-based phenomenological theory that is valid for magnetism should also be transferrable to electric systems and vice versa. Note that this conclusion is also technically valid even if Dij and D0ij do not explicitly depend on oxygen octahedral tiltings, which are hyIpothetical cases not considered above. Indeed, our DFT results and the symmetry analysis detailed above for perovskites show that electric DMI can originate from the existence of oxygen octahedral tiltings and their trilinear interactions with different possible cationic modes, but symmetry arguments do not prevent other quantities from also generating electric DMI. For example, we have examined one possible mechanism for electric DMI without involving tiltings but involving electric polarization (Supplementary Discussion VI), and discovered a polarization-driven electric DMI that is the counterpart of the magnetic DMI based on a spin–current model39. On the other hand, the microscopic origin for magnetic and electric DMIs are, of course, completely different. Indeed, the former stems from

spin–orbit coupling whereas the latter does not. A definite proof is

that we obtained non-collinear (anti)ferroelectricity by performing

first-principles simulations without having to include spin–orbit

coupling. It is noteworthy that both the electric and magnetic DMIs

structurally stem from the distortions (for example, tiltings and

polarization) in the same manner as seen from our above analysis.

It is interesting to extract the strengths of the electric and magnetic

DMIs from their effects (for example, dipole and spin cantings).

We thus employ LaFeO3 and BiAlO3 to make such a comparison. Starting from the cubic phases (of LaFeO3 and BiAlO3), we impose a sequence of z-oriented anti-phase tiltings with various magnitudes,

and create the R-point modulated predominant antiferroelectric or antiferromagnetic vectors along the x direction (denoted by BRx ); then we perform structural relaxations or non-collinear magnetiIsm

calculations, and obtain the weak ferroelectric motion or weak mag-

netism along the y direction (denoted by BΓy) for each configuration

with specified anti-phase tilting. The electrIic and magnetic versions

example, of ωRz are

sIhown in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the dipole cantings can be much lIarger

than spin cantings in magnitude, reflecting that the electric D0=J0

(D0 and J0 being the electric DMI and the exchange interaction)Ican

beI much Istronger than its magnetic counterpart. See Supplementary

Discussion VII for detailed discussion.

Other mechanisms for non-collinear dipole patterns
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the electric DMI is not the only mechanism creating non-collinear dipole patterns. For instance, there are six additional couplings in the form of ∑αβγϵαβγωαQ1,βQ2,β
(α, β = x, y, z, α ≠ β), shown in Supplementary Table II and Supplementary Discussion III and IV, with none of them implying a DMI because the Q1 and Q2 modes are along the same direction (Supplementary Table II)—while they can host non-collinear ferroelectricity or antiferroelectricity in some special cases.

Moreover, in Pbnm ABO3 perovskites with both in-phase and anti-phase BO6 tiltings (for example, ωMz z, ωRxy), there are two kinds of A-site anti-polar motions (that is, AXxIyz andI ARxy) sourced from ωRxyωMz z AXxyz and ωRxyωMz z ωMz z ARxy, respectivIely40. ThiIs leads to anotherIkind of non-coIllinear antifer-
roelectricity which does not depend on the electric DMI either.
Similarly, if we create polarization by forming hybrid improper ferroelectricity in, for example, A′BO3/A″BO3 superlattices41–45, we then obtain non-collinear ferroelectricity that is not related to an
electric DMI. In fact, non-collinear electric dipole patterns can also
appear in nanostructures due to effects that are different from DMI. One example is the Bloch components in the 180° domain wall of PbTiO3, as predicted by second- and first-principles simulations46,47. In fact, these Bloch components, arising from a symmetry-breaking phase transition at the domain wall, do not rely on the electric DMI but are rather due to the spatial deviation of polarization (for example, (∇P)2, from the viewpoint of phenomenological theory)48 or Pb–O hybridization at the domain wall (from the viewpoint of chemical bonding)47. Similarly, the recently proposed electric skyrmion/bubbles in PbTiO3 are partly formed as a result of these Bloch components49. Meanwhile, the mixed Bloch/Néel-type electric bubble domains (seen as the precursor of electric skyrmions) found in ref. 24 mostly rely on the depolarizing field and not at all on electric DMI.

Perspective Our findings clearly support the existence of an electric DMI and reveal the one-to-one correspondence between it and its magnetic

counterpart. As a result, the present work enables the generalization between magnetic and electric theories as long as these theories are rooted in the DMI. Furthermore, we anticipate that various magnetic-DMI-related phenomena will probably find their equivalent parts for electric systems. We thus hope that this article opens or deepens the field of DMIs in systems possessing dipoles. In particular, by comparing with magnetic cases, ref. 28 proposed the existence of electric Bloch skyrmions due to u ⋅ (∇ × u) (where u is the displacement). Similarly, symmetry arguments also imply the occurrence of uz(∇ ⋅ u) − (u ⋅ ∇)uz, which can create, in principle, electric Néel skyrmions (Supplementary Discussion V). It will be interesting to determine if electric skyrmions based on these two mechanisms of the electric DMI can be discovered in real materials.

Methods

We employ the VASP code50,51 to perform first-principles simulations with the

PBEsol functional52 based on the projector augmented wave53, taking BiAlO3 as a model system. In particular, we work with a 40-atom supercell (2 × 2 × 2),

solving (5d, 6s, 6p) electrons for Bi, (3s, 3p) for Al and (2s, 2p) for O, with

Ecut = 500 eV BiAlO3 with

and a k-point mesh of 6 × 6 × 6. We start from the cubic perovskite Pm3m symmetry (lattice parameter a = 2apc = 7.64 Å, where apc is the

pseudo-cubicIlattice constant), impose anti-phase or in-phase tiltings for AlO6

octahedra, displace the Bi or Al ions in some distortion modes, and then compute

and analyse the forces on the Bi and Al ions. The energetic coupling terms are

derived by group-theoretical-based symmetry analysis54 with the help of the Bilbao

Crystallographic Server (https://www.cryst.ehu.es); such couplings are reproduced

by the L-INVARIANT code (https://github.com/PaulChern/LINVARIANT/) based

on Mathematica software (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica) with the help

of ISOTROPY Software Suite (https://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isotropy.php). Some

of the figures are prepared by using VESTA55, Matplotlib56 and Mathematica as

well. Regarding Supplementary Discussion VII, we solve the following electronic

configurations by VASP: (5p, 5d, 6s) for La, (3p, 3d, 4s) for Fe and (2s, 2p) for O

within the framework of the local density approximation functional57. In particular,

we use the local density approximation functional to achieve a good convergence

for the calculations of non-collinear magnetism. Also, a Hubbard U correction58

with an effective U value of 4.0 eV is carried out for the 3d electrons of Fe. To

further save computational time, in non-collinear magnetism calculations, a

relatively coarse but still sufficiently dense k-point mesh of 4 × 4 × 4 was used.

Data availability
All the data (for example, raw data and Matplotlib-based scripts for analysing and visualizing the data) supporting the present work are available from the corresponding author upon request. Please note that our data figures were prepared with the use of some Matplotlib-based scripts (for example, with some mathematical processes such as post-processing of the data or fitting inside the scripts). Consequently, we prefer to share our raw data as well as the scripts to interested readers on request, so that we can help them in case of need. We do not upload our data and scripts because the latter may depend on the version of Python.
