We show that entanglement is a useful resource to
enhance the mutual information of the depolarizing
channel when the noise on consecutive uses of the
channel has some partial correlations. We obtain a
threshold in the degree of memory, depending on the
shrinking factor of the channel, above which a higher
amount of classical information is transmitted with
entangled signals.
The classical capacity of quantum channels, i.e. the amount of classical information which can be reliably transmitted by quantum states in the presence of a noisy environment has received renewed interest in recent years [1]. One of the main focuses of such interest is the study of entanglement as a useful resource to enhance the classical channel capacity. Although the theory does not rule this possibility out, the search for superaddivity of quantum channels has led sofar to the evidence that no such property is present in memoryless channels. This has been ﬁrst proved analytically for the case of two entangled uses of the depolarizing channel [2] and then extended to a broader class of memoryless channels [3]. In this paper we will turn our attention to a diﬀerent class of channels, namely to channels with partial memory. For such channels our results show that a higher mutual information can indeed be achieved above a certain memory threshold by entangling two consecutive uses of the channel. In the following each use of the channel will be a qubit, i.e will be a quantum state belonging to a twodimensional Hilbert space. The action of transmission channels is described by Kraus operators
[4] Ai, satisfying i A†i Ai = 1l, such that if we send through the channel a qubit in a state described by the density operator π the corresponding output state is given by the map

π −→ Φ(π) = AiπA†i

An interesting class of Kraus operators acting on in-

dividual qubits can be expressed in terms of the Pauli

operators σx,y,z

Ai = √piσi ,

(2)

with i pi = 1 , i = 0, x, y, z and σ0 = 1l. A noise model for these actions is for instance the application of a random rotation of the angle π around axis xˆ, yˆ, ˆz with probability px, py, pz and the identity with probability p0.
In the simplest scenario the transmitter can send one qubit at a time along the channel. In this case the codewords will be restricted to be the tensor products of the states of the individual qubits. Quantum mechanics however allows also the possibility to entangle multiple uses of the channel. For this more general strategy it has been shown that the amount of reliable information which can be transmitted per use of the channel is given by [1]

where E = {Pi, πi} with Pi ≥ 0, Pi = 1 is the input ensemble of states πi, transmitted with a priori probabilities Pi, of n – generally entangled – qubits and In(E) is the mutual information

is the von Neumann entropy, ρi = Φ(πi) are the density matrices describing the output states and ρ = i Piρi. Logarithms are taken to base 2. The advantage of the expression 4) is that it includes an optimization over all possible POVMs at the output, including collective ones. Therefore no explicit maximization procedure for the decoding at the output of the channel is needed.
The interest for the possibility of using entangled states as channel inputs is motivated by the fact that it cannot generally be excluded that In(E) is superadditive in the presence of entanglement, i.e. we might have In+m > In + Im and therefore Cn > C1.
In this scenario the classical capacity C of the channel is deﬁned as

Sofar the main objects of investigation have been memoryless channels. By deﬁnition a channel is memoryless when its action on arbitrary signals πs, consisting of n qubits (including entangled ones), is given by

Φ(πs) =

(Ain ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ai1 )πs(A†i1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ A†in ) (7)

i1 ···in

In the case of Pauli channels a more general situation is described by action operators of the following form

Ak1...kn = √pk1...kn σk1 . . . σkn ,

(8)

with p k1...kn k1...kn = 1. The quantity pk1...kn can be interpreted as the probability that a given random se-
quence of rotations of an angle π along axis k1 . . . kn is applied to the sequence of n qubits sent through the chan-
nel. For a memoryless channel pk1...kn = pk1 pk2 . . . pkn . An interesting generalization is described by a Markov chain deﬁned as

pk1...kn = pk1 pk2|k1 . . . pkn|kn−1

(9)

where pkn|kn−1 can be interpreted as the conditional probability that a π rotation around axis kn is applied to the n-th qubit given that a π rotation around axis kn−1 was applied on the n − 1-th qubit. Here we will consider the case of two consecutive uses of a channel with partial
memory, i.e. we will assume pkn|kn−1 = (1 − µ)pkn + µδkn|kn−1. This means that with probability µ the same rotation is applied to both qubits while with probability
1 − µ the two rotations are uncorrelated. In our noise model the degree of memory µ could de-
pend on the time lap between the two channel uses. If
the two qubits are sent at a very short time interval the properties of the channel, which determine the direction
of the random rotations, will be unchanged, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that the action on both
qubits will take the form

Ack = √pkσkσk .

(10)

If on the other hand, the time interval between the channel uses is such that the channel properties have changed then the actions will be

Auk1,k2 = √pk1 √pk2 σk1 σk2 .

(11)

An intermediate case, as mentioned above, is described by actions of the form

Aik1,k2 = (1 − µ)pkn + µδkn|kn−1 σk2 σk2 .

(12)

It is straightforward to verify that the Bell states, deﬁned in the basis |0 , |1 of the eigenstates of the σz operators as

|Φ±

= √1 {|00 ± |11 } 2

|Ψ±

= √1 {|01 ± |10 } 2

(13)

are eigenstates of the operators Ack and therefore will pass undisturbed through the channel. If used as
equiprobable signal states they maximise I2, as we will have I2 = 2. Furthermore it is immediate to verify that the value I2 = 2 cannot be achieved by any ensemble of tensor product input states. This situation is reminiscent of the so called noiseless codes, where collective states are
used to encode and protect quantum information against collective noise [7].
In the following we will concentrate our attention to
the depolarizing channel, for which p0 = 1 − p and pi = p/3, i = x, y, z. We will consider an ensemble of orthogonal input states parametrised as follows

|π1 = cos ϑ|00 + sin ϑ|11

|π2 = sin ϑ|00 − cos ϑ|11

|π3 = cos ϑ|01 + sin ϑ|10

|π4 = sin ϑ|01 − cos ϑ|10 .

(14)

Although it is not a priori certain that this is the opti-

mal choice for all values of µ we know that it maximizes

C2 with ϑ = 0 for µ = 0 (uncorrelated noise), and with

ϑ=

π 4

for

µ=1

(fully

correlated noise).

We will there-

fore optimize the ansatz (14) by looking for the value

ϑ(µ) which maximizes I2 as a function of µ.

We will now show that there is a threshold value µt for

where the Bloch vectors and tensor are deﬁned respectively as βi = tr(πσi), χij = tr(πσiσj). We will express the action of the channel in terms of the so called shrinking factor η = 1 − 4p/3.
It is straightforward to verify that for µ = 0

(17)

It is interesting to note that both for µ = 0 and for µ = 1 the components of the Bloch vectors βk(i) of the input states are shrunk isotropically by the shrinking factor η.
The diﬀerence between the two cases is the action on the Bloch tensor χ. The input state |π1 is transformed by the action of the depolarizing cannel with partial memory
deﬁned in equation (12) into the output state ρ1

λ3,4 =

±2 η2 cos2 2ϑ + [η2(1 − µ) + µ]2 sin2 2ϑ (20)

Notice that the ﬁrst two eigenvalues are degenerate and
do not depend on ϑ. The same eigenvalues are obtained
for the output states ρ2, ρ3, ρ4. The Von Neumann entropy S(ρi) is minimized as a function of ϑ when the term under square root in the expression for λ3,4 is maximum. The mutual information is then maximized for equiprob-
able states πi corresponding to the minimum Von Neumann entropy. Therefore for η2 > [η2(1 − µ) + µ]2 the
mutual information is maximal for uncorrelated states ϑ = 0, while for η2 < [η2(1 − µ) + µ]2 it is maximal for
the Bell states. The threshold value µt is a function of the shrinking factor and takes the form

(21)

Therefore, for channels with µ < µt the most convenient choice within the ansatz (14) corresponds to uncorrelated states, while for µ > µt to maximally entangled states. At the threshold value any set of states of the form (14) leads to the same value for the mutual information. As an example, the behaviour of the mutual information is plotted in Fig. ??.
It is interesting to notice that, within the ansatz (14), for any value of µ the mutual information is optimized by either maximally entangled or completely unentangled states . We have used sofar the z axis as the axis of

quantisation for the system; notice that, due to the symmetry of the channel, the same results hold also using x or y as the axis of quantisation.
Notice that sofar we have restricted our attention to input states of the form (14). We will now show that the product states that are less deteriorated when transmitted through the channel are the eigenstates of σz1σz2 or σy1σy2 or σx1σx2. This suggests that no diﬀerent choice of product signal states can achieve a higher I2 than our ansatz (14). From Eqs. (16) and (17) it follows that the output density operator corresponding to an arbitrary input product state takes the form

(22)

A measure of the degree of purity of the state at the output of the channel is given by Tr[ρ2]. It is straight-
forward to show that for the above state we have

Tr[Φ(π)2]=

(23)

The above expression is maximised when both Bloch vectors point in the same x, y or z direction. It is straightforward to verify that these states maximise also the ﬁdelity, deﬁned as Tr[πΦ(π)]. Moreover, we have numerical evidence that for any value of µ and η the input product states that maximise the mutual information are still of this form. Therefore, no better choice of product

states leads to a higher mutual information than the one achieved by the ansatz (14).
Finally we would like to point out that for input product states the mutual information I2(µ = 1, ϑ = 0) > I2(µ = 0, ϑ = 0):

I2(µ = 0, ϑ = 0) = {(1 + η) log(1 + η) + (1 − η) log(1 − η)}

This is due to the fact that the correlation tensor is multiplied by a larger shrinking factor hen the noise is collective. In other words, in the presence of perfect memory with two uses of the channel it is possible to achieve a higher mutual information than in the case of memoryless channels even if we restrict to product states.
In conclusion, we have shown that the transmission of classical information over a quantum depolarising channel with collective noise can be enhanced by employing maximally entangled states as carriers of information rather than product states. We believe that this result opens new perspectives for the use of entanglement in communications and information processing.
