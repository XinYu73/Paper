Insights into exactly 15 how lithium is arranged within those are, however, challenging to obtain in operando. 16 Using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM)3-5 to probe light elements (especially 17 Li) 6,7 is severely hampered by their low scattering cross section for impinging electrons 18 and their susceptibility to knock-on damage8. Here, we study the reversible Li intercalation 19 of bilayer graphene by in situ spherical and chromatic aberration-corrected low-voltage 20 TEM9, supported by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and density functional 21 theory (DFT) calculations. Upon their remote insertion from an electrochemical gate, we 22 observe Li atoms to assume multi-layered close-packed order between the two carbon

23 sheets. The associated Li storage capacity by far exceeds the one of LiC6‚Äîthe densest 24 configuration known under normal conditions for bulk graphitic carbon10. Our findings 25 thus point to the possible existence of distinct storage arrangements of ions in 2D layered 26 materials as compared to their bulk parent compounds.

27 Figure 1a shows a schematic of our devices, all of which are supported by Si3N4-covered Si 28 substrates. The Si3N4 forms a 40¬¥40 ¬µm2 membrane at the centre of the Si-chip. The bilayer 29 graphene flake is exfoliated from natural graphite and etched into a Hall bar shape. One end of 30 the flake is connected to a counter electrode via a Li-ion conducting solid polymer electrolyte. 31 This setup allows for the controlled electrochemical reduction/oxidation of bilayer graphene 32 according to1

34 Similar to Refs. [11, 12], we trigger lithiation (delithiation) by applying a positive voltage UG = 35 5 V (UG = 0 V) to the counter electrode with respect to bilayer graphene. A grounded current 36 lead to the latter serves as a source/sink for electrons required to facilitate the reversible 37 intercalation of Li-ions at the electrolyte-covered end of bilayer graphene. Intercalated Li 38 exhibits rapid lateral diffusion that tends to establish and maintain an even distribution of Li 39 throughout the bilayer.13 Hence, one may study its ordering in a region well separated from the 40 electrolyte by in situ TEM (Figs. 1a‚Äìb), thereby also preventing exposure of the electrolyte to 41 the electron beam. In the region probed by TEM, bilayer graphene is suspended over a hole in 42 the Si3N4 membrane. Metallic contacts to the bilayer allow monitoring its resistivity ùúå++ = 43 ùëà++/ùêº in the electrolyte-uncovered region (Fig. 1a). During subsequent lithiation/delithiation 44 cycles, we typically observe reversible changes in ùúå++ (Fig. 1c). These relate to changes in the 45 local Li concentration via finite electronic charge transfer.12,13 The drop in ùúå++ during lithiation 46 reflects an increase in electron density, characteristic for ambipolar diffusion of electron-ion

2

47 pairs into the probed area.13 During delithiation, Li-ions and electrons leave the bilayer, thereby 48 restoring its initial resistivity value. The exact time evolution of ùúå++ depends on the kinetics of 49 several (uncontrolled) processes, related to e.g. ionic transport within the electrolyte and across 50 the solid electrolyte interphase. Yet, Fig. 1c is a qualitative characteristic of reversible Li 51 intercalation in bilayer graphene.13 In the following, we present in situ TEM data obtained in the 52 SALVE (Sub-√Öngstr√∂m Low-Voltage Electron microscopy) microscope9. We work at an 53 electron acceleration voltage of 80 kV, just below the threshold for knock-on damage of C atoms 54 in graphene.14 Despite these conditions, the instrument still delivers sub-√Öngstr√∂m resolution in 55 the images. Further details can be found in Methods (also Extended Data Figs. 1‚Äì2).

57 Figure 2a shows a TEM image of pristine bilayer graphene. The inset depicts its Fourier 58 transform (FT) and confirms the known value of the in-plane lattice constant aC = 2.46 √Ö. The 59 image marks the beginning of a series acquired during lithiation of a bilayer graphene device 60 (Figs. 2a‚Äìc and Supplementary Video 1), but it is representative of the sample state prior to 61 application of the bias voltage ùëºùëÆ = ùüì ùëΩ. In Fig. 2b, acquired after 170 s, a second crystal lattice 62 has appeared in the lower half of the probed area. White dashed lines demarcate its boundary on 63 the left and right of the image. The image in Fig. 2c is recorded at t = 288 s. The additional 64 crystal structure now extends throughout almost the whole field of view. Fig. 2d is the Fourier 65 transform of Fig. 2b. Compared with the Fourier transform of pristine bilayer graphene (inset to 66 Fig. 2a), we identify three sets of additional signals, highlighted in red, green, and blue. These 67 attest to hexagonal crystalline order (as for graphene), but with an in-plane lattice constant of 68 3.1 √Ö. In Fig. 2e, their spatial distribution is mapped. This allows discerning three grains none 69 of which are aligned to the encapsulating graphene lattice. In Fig. 2f the same Fourier transform 70 is shown but with a von Hann filter applied to minimize the streaks. The highlighted signals 71 stem from both bilayer graphene (cyan) and the additional crystalline phase (green) as well as
3

72 Moir√© artefacts (magenta) and their origin (bold arrows). Fig. 2g is a Fourier-filtered (Methods 73 and Extended Data Fig. 3) version of panel b, where the graphene lattice, as well as the Moir√© 74 effects, have been removed (see panels h and i for a magnification before and after filtering). 75 These images offer a direct view on the encapsulated crystal. The observed contrast in the images 76 also suggests regions of different thickness even within a single grain. This is worked out in 77 detail in Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4.
78
79 To narrow down the chemical composition of the additional crystal structure, EELS data has 80 been acquired on bilayer graphene before and during lithiation (Fig. 2j). Before lithiation, we 81 exclusively observe the C K-edge at 284 eV. During lithiation the Li K-edge at 55 eV on regions 82 characterized by a Fourier transform as in Fig. 2d is additionally detected. Based on the absence 83 of other signals in the explored energy range of 0‚Äì800 eV, Si (L2,3-edge starting at 99 eV), S 84 (L2,3-edge starting at 165 eV), N (K-edge starting at 400 eV), O (K-edge starting at 532 eV and 85 F (K-edge starting at 685 eV) are discarded as significant constituents of the new crystalline 86 phase. Likewise, Ti and Pt (electrode material) can be ruled out based on the observed light 87 atomic contrast in Fig. 2 for the case of Pt and on the absence of the distinct Ti L2,3-edge at 456 88 eV in the EELS data. Although it is inherently impossible to exclude H or C, the crystalline 89 phase formed during lithiation likely consists of pure Li. The low onset in energy of the Li K90 edge supports this assertion.15,16 Also, a Li plasmon mode appears near 9 eV17,18 (Extended Data 91 Fig. 5a). Though the shape of the Li-K edge resembles the one of Li2O/LiOH,15,16 stoichiometric 92 Li2O/LiOH can be disqualified, since we would then expect both a more pronounced O-K edge 93 as well as an imaging contrast comparable in strength to the encapsulating graphene.19 Good 94 agreement with experiment is attained when calculating the Li-K edge shape of graphene95 encapsulated Li multilayers (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 5b). We do not rule out the 96 presence of trace oxygen, also suggested by the occasional observation of a weak shoulder near
4

97 30 eV (Extended Data Fig. 5a), previously attributed to oxidized lithium.17,18 Yet, the extracted 98 in-plane lattice constant of 3.1 √Ö matches close-packed Li.20 This coincidence is surprising, 99 since normally very low temperatures and/or extreme pressures are required for Li to assume 100 this ordering.21
101
102 To test whether indeed the formation of a dense, multi-layered Li crystal in bilayer graphene is 103 conceivable, first-principles calculations were carried out (Methods). The chemical potential of 104 Li atoms in bulk close-packed phases was evaluated. All energies below are given with respect 105 to the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase, which had the lowest energy in the calculations. 106 Several layers of Li atoms inside bilayer graphene are considered (Fig. 3 and Extended Data 107 Figs. 6‚Äì8). Since the in situ TEM studies do not reveal evidence for a change in registry of the 108 graphene sheets (Extended Data Fig. 9), AB stacking is assumed as in the pristine device. Our 109 main conclusions, however, hold irrespective of the stacking order. The relaxation of atomic 110 coordinates of a single layer of Li atoms yields an energetically favoured C6LiC6 configuration, 111 with Li arranged in a commensurate (‚àö3√ó‚àö3)R30¬∞ superstructure with a lattice constant of aLiC6 112 = 4.26 √Ö (Figs. 3a‚Äìb). Except for the graphene registry, this finding is similar to the bulk LiC6 113 phase10 and the AA-stacked C6LiC6 phase22. The situation changes for a larger number of Li 114 layers. Finite clusters and infinite (periodic) hcp structures with different orientation with respect 115 to the graphene lattice were considered (Figs. 3c‚Äìf, Extended Data Figs. 7‚Äì8). The energies of 116 these systems are very close to that of the C6LiC6 configuration (higher by only 0.01‚Äì0.05 eV/ 117 Li atom). The in-plane lattice constant aLi of the Li hcp bilayer and trilayer (average distances, 118 as the positions of Li atoms are affected by nearby C atoms) is in the range of 3.05‚Äì3.15 √Ö, 119 matching the experimental value of 3.1 √Ö as well as the identical literature value.20 These results 120 suggest that the formation of a multilayer close-packed Li phase between graphene sheets is 121 conceivable. Its precise stacking order may however differ from hcp as other configurations are
5

122 energetically similar (Extended Data Fig. 8d‚Äìe). These are hard to distinguish in these TEM 123 experiments, because we may only observe the projection along one crystal direction. Moreover, 124 some bulk diffraction selection rules do not hold in the given case of an atomically thin 125 specimen. TEM image simulations reveal comparable contrast and diffraction patterns for the 126 two extreme cases: cubic close-packed (ccp) and hexagonal close packed (Extended Data Fig. 127 2f‚Äìg).
128
129 By analysing the electronic structure and charge distribution, the charge transfer between Li and 130 graphene can be estimated. Fig. 3b,d and f display colour renditions of the charge probability 131 distribution as compared to isolated graphene and Li crystals consisting of a single, double or 132 triple layer. As can be seen from Fig. 3f in the triple layer case, charge transfer is significant 133 only for the outer Li layers directly neighbouring a graphene sheet. Inner Li layers retain their 134 metallic character as electronic charge is distributed between the Li+ lattice sites. Extended Data 135 Fig. 8c depicts the average charge transfer per Li atom, which drops as the close-packed Li phase 136 gets thicker. Renormalizing by the number of atoms in the outermost Li layers only, we find a 137 constant charge transfer of approximately 0.33 e‚àí/outer Li atom, irrespective of how many 138 (metallic) Li layers (with nearly zero charge transfer) are packed in between. This is consistent 139 with the observation that the resistivity ùúå++ measured during lithiation tends to saturate rather 140 than to decrease progressively as more Li enters bilayer graphene (Fig. 1c). Note that although 141 for C6LiC6 (Figs. 3a‚Äìb) a higher value of 0.85 e‚àí/Li atom for the charge transfer applies resulting 142 in an estimated density of transferred electrons of 2.7¬∑1014 cm-2 per graphene sheet, the much 143 denser arrangement of Li atoms in the close-packed structure yields a higher electron density 144 per graphene sheet of 4¬∑1014 cm-2 despite the smaller charge transfer value.

146 During lithiation, the close-packed Li phase grows laterally between the graphene sheets (Fig. 147 4a and Supplementary Video 1). In Fig. 4a, The graphene signals have been Fourier filtered in 148 order to reveal the Li crystal structure. Three grains of varying in-plane orientation have been 149 coloured for the sake of illustration. While the grain boundary between the central grain (green) 150 and the lower right grain (blue) is rather sharp and stable, the one with the left grain (red) appears 151 more fuzzy and mobile as their orientation nearly matches. Regions of different thickness can 152 be identified even within a single grain (Extended Data Fig. 4). The specimen is too thin to 153 reliably extract its exact thickness ùë° from EELS (we typically obtain ùë°‚ÅÑùúÜ < 0.1, where ùúÜ is the 154 inelastic mean free path of our 80 keV electrons). One may nonetheless determine relative 155 variations (see Methods). When imaging an extremely thin slab of weakly scattering elements 156 in a microscope with sufficient resolving power, the imaging contrast does increase with 157 increasing specimen thickness. This is quantified in the Extended Data Figs. 4e‚Äìf, revealing that 158 thinner parts of the close-packed Li phase tend to be located closer to its perimeter. At the leading 159 edge, single atoms can be identified (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1). From the image time 160 series, a lateral growth rate of the order of 1 √Ö/s can be extracted. During delithiation the close161 packed Li phase disassembles and gradually disappears (Fig. 4b). Eventually, the pure bilayer 162 graphene lattice remains behind. The degree of reversibility of this process is limited by the 163 number of defects in the graphene lattice and their irreversible formation during prolonged 164 imaging (electron irradiation). Given the combined slow image acquisition (on the order of 1 s) 165 and low sensitivity to light atoms, Li diffusing at speed in less ordered configuration remains 166 concealed to the TEM observer. Such processes are nonetheless present in parallel with the close 167 packing as well as beyond the boundaries of this phase and are likely responsible for the initial 168 abrupt change in resistivity ùúå++ during lithiation (Fig. 1c).

170 We note that the observed crystalline phase of Li proves stable between intact graphene planes 171 only. With the incident electron energy exceeding the threshold for displacement damage of Li 172 (~20 keV), conditions are such that Li readily ‚Äúboils‚Äù under the electron beam16,18. The close173 packed phase is volatile when imaged near bilayer edges or in the presence of a high density of 174 defects in the graphene lattice. Constituents may escape from between graphene sheets via such 175 edges or defects upon electron-beam induced melting of the crystalline phase. Likewise, we find 176 material having escaped from within and agglomerated on the outer bilayer surfaces near such 177 defects to quickly evaporate under electron beam irradiation. The protective encapsulation by 178 two impermeable atomic sheets may thus be regarded a prerequisite to safe probing by TEM of 179 the crystal formation therein, akin to the situation in graphene liquid cells23.
180
181 Close-packing of Li intercalated between graphene sheets, as demonstrated here, results in a 182 structure with Li-content in great excess of LiC6. Although enhanced Li storage has been 183 proposed to occur on the outside of graphene planes24,25 previously, suggested atomistic 184 configurations were contradictory among the different works and could neither be addressed nor 185 verified by microscopic means. The same holds for the scarce reports claiming the formation of 186 nanocrystallites of close-packed Li during the lithiation of different carbon allotropes.26,27 At 187 elevated temperatures, a similar configuration of Li, as we report here, may, as a matter of fact, 188 have been left unidentified in bulk graphite.28 Since the energy cost for close-packing of Li in 189 the van der Waals gap of bilayer graphene as compared to forming C6LiC6 is very similar (Fig. 190 3), close-packing may be the answer of the system for having to accommodate a larger amount 191 of Li supplied within a short time. The activation energy for Li diffusion in bilayer graphene has 192 been calculated (Methods). It points toward facile diffusion of Li between graphene sheets, even 193 in the presence of a close-packed Li phase. Even though, a bilayer can be regarded as the 194 fundamental unit of bulk graphite, it may still feature considerably distinct properties and in
8

195 particular its layers may spread more easily to accommodate for dense intercalate ordering. It 196 should also be noted that Li-graphite intercalation compounds only occupy a small region in the 197 C-Li binary alloy phase diagram.29 In the miscibility gap beyond LiC6, alternative configurations 198 may be available for storing larger amounts of lithium in layered carbons.30

The cross-shaped 305 streaks are edge artefacts from the Fourier transform. e, Spatial distribution of the Li grains in 306 (b) with the colour coding from (d). f, von Hann-filtered Fourier transform of (b). Fourier 307 transforms are point symmetric, therefore, marks on the left side do not mask information. 308 Signals from bilayer graphene (Li) are highlighted in cyan (green); (the origin of) Moir√© artefacts 309 are highlighted in (bold) magenta. The anisotropic smearing of the Li signals is due to the sharp 310 propagation front. Signals originating from the grains coloured red and blue in e are dampened 311 away by the applied von Hann filter. Half circles represent the fundamental periodicities of 0.213 312 nm for graphene (cyan) and 0.276 nm for Li (green). g, Fourier-filtered version of (b) where the 313 graphene lattice, as well as the Moir√© effects, are filtered out and only the Li crystal structure is 314 left. The contrast at the edge of the figure is an artefact from the Fourier filter. h, i, Magnified 315 detail from the demarcated areas in b and g respectively, showing the Li crystal edge. Scale bars 316 of equal size are coloured identically but labelled only once in (a‚Äìg). j, EELS data with 317 logarithmic intensity scale before (blue) and during (yellow) lithiation acquired on an area as in 318 (a) and (c), respectively. Highlighted are the energies of the relevant major edges. Insets show 319 the near-edge structure of the Li and C K-edges on a linear intensity scale and after individual 320 subtraction of an inverse-power law background. Note that EELS data get noisy at high energies 321 because of the exponential decay of the signal.

323 Figure 3 | Atomistic models of Li crystals between AB-stacked graphene sheets obtained 324 from DFT calculations. a, b, The ‚Äòconventional‚Äô C6LiC6 configuration with Li arranged in a 325 commensurate (‚àö3√ó‚àö3)R30¬∞ superstructure between graphene sheets. c, d, Fully optimized 326 bilayer Li crystal. e, f, Fully optimized trilayer Li crystal (one of two energetically close stacking 327 configurations, compare with Extended Data Fig. 8d). The projection of the latter two structures 328 matches well the experimental observations. (a, c, e) are top views and (b, d, f) are side views 329 along the dashed line given in the respective top view. C atoms and sp2-bonds are grey, Li atoms 330 are magenta. The insets in (a, c, e) schematically show diffraction patterns associated with the 331 respective structure (scale bar is 2 nm-1), with first order diffraction spots from the Li (C) lattice 332 indicated in magenta (grey). The close-packed Li phase in (c, e) may assume any relative rotation 333 angle with respect to the bilayer graphene lattice at virtually no additional energy cost (see 334 Extended Data Fig. 7b). A faint magenta circle indicates that the Li diffraction spots may 335 therefore be rotated with respect to those of graphene. Ef is the energy required to take a Li atom 336 from a bulk Li crystal and insert it between graphene sheets in the corresponding configuration. 337 Contour plots in (b, d, f) represent the charge transfer between Li and graphene as compared to 338 the isolated graphene and Li crystals. An increase in the electron density (negative charge) is 339 blue, and a decrease in the electron density (positive charge) is red. Note the smaller average 340 charge transfer to graphene for the multilayer Li crystals.

342 Figure 4 | Li crystal growth between two graphene sheets. a, b, Time series of TEM images 343 after Fourier filtering of the bilayer graphene signal acquired during (a) lithiation and (b) 344 delithiation. Crystal grains of different in-plane orientation are coloured in red, green, and blue. 345 An increased amount of amorphous, immobilized residues (grey areas, essentially composed of 346 carbon) are present within the field of view in (b), an unavoidable consequence of extended 347 electron beam illumination. In both (a, b) the interface with the electrolyte (not contained in the 348 images) is oriented towards the bottom of the page.
