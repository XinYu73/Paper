Two mechanisms of melting are known, heterogeneous, where melting starts at surfaces, and homogeneous,
where the liquid nucleates in the bulk crystal. If melting occurs homogeneously, a crystal can be superheated signiﬁcantly above its melting temperature ͑Tm͒. At present, the physical meaning of the limit of superheating ͑TLS͒ is unknown. We demonstrate, by molecular dynamics simulations, that the total energy of a solid at TLS is equal to the total energy of its liquid at Tm at the same volume. In the high pressure limit TLS and Tm are connected by the constant kAB = ln 2 / 3 via the relation kAB = TLS/ Tm − 1.

Melting is the most common structural transition, yet the nature of melting is not completely understood.1,2 The melt-
ing, as we usually observe it, is the so-called heterogeneous melting,3 where melting is initiated due to inhomogeneities.
Under special conditions, it is possible to melt a solid in a homogeneous way.4–6 It has been observed, that if a crystal
melts homogeneously, it can be overheated substantially
above its Tm. However, there is a critical TLS, above which one cannot heat a solid without transforming it into a liquid
structure. For the case of heterogeneous melting we have a
number of criteria which tell us the physical content of Tm, for example, the equality of the Gibbs or Helmholtz free
energies of the solid and liquid phases at Tm. A number of criteria has been suggested7–12 for TLS. For example, Born9 suggested that the solid loses its shear strength at TLS. Recently, it has been demonstrated that all of these criteria,
including the Born criterion, are preceded by the nucleation of liquid at TLS.11,13–16 This nucleation, once initiated, leads to a complete melting. Therefore, at present the physical
meaning of TLS is not clear. While explaining in detail the microscopic mechanism of the solid-liquid transition at TLS, recent studies13–16 tell us little about the meaning of TLS other than this is the temperature ͑T͒ at which the solid-liquid
transition occurs, which is merely the deﬁnition of TLS. Superheating is a comparably rare phenomenon in nature, still
it is routinely simulated by researchers who attempt to deter-
mine the Tm of a substance. This is because a perfect crystal with periodic boundary conditions ͑PBC͒ is simulated in a typical molecular dynamics ͑MD͒ run. A perfect crystal with PBC has no surfaces which are required to avoid superheat-
ing. Therefore, atomistic simulations without an interface are
perfectly suited to study homogeneous melting.
In this study, we establish a connection between TLS and Tm. We simulate a perfect crystal using the MD method. As a model for describing the interactions between atoms we have chosen the Lennard-Jones ͑LJ͒ potential. This model has also been employed in a similar study.15 The LJ model is excep-
tionally well studied, and a number of its properties is established.15,17
When studying superheating, it is important how the
simulated crystal is heated. Usually, two methods are ap-

plied. The velocities are either scaled to the desired T, while
in the second one the crystal is coupled to a thermal bath. In
our study, the major question is: What happens to a super-
heated crystal when T reaches TLS? An obvious answer is that it melts, however, it is not obvious how this would
change the T of the system. To be able to answer this ques-
tion, we must not interfere with the evolution of the crystal
in our simulations. Apparently, neither the scaling nor the
thermal bath method is suitable for that purpose. In our simu-
lations, we have instead chosen a third approach. Namely, a
certain amount of kinetic energy is provided to the facecentered cubic ͑fcc͒ crystal in the very beginning of the MD simulations. After that, the system is allowed to evolve on its
own, equilibrating to some T.
We have performed MD simulations of the initialy perfect
fcc LJ crystal. The parameters of the LJ potential were ⑀ / kB = 119.8 K ͑kB—Boltzmann constant͒ and ␴ = 3.41 Å, which are the physical parameters of argon. The number of particles was 4000 ͑10ϫ 10ϫ 10 cells͒ and 32 000 ͑20ϫ 20 ϫ 20 cells͒ on to check the size effect PBC were applied. The timestep was set equal to 0.25ϫ 10−15 s to ensure a very good conservation of energy. Normally, 250 thousands timesteps were sufﬁcient to get statistically reliable results. We calculated three isochores for the unit cells with a = 4.2 Å, a = 4.4 Å, and a = 5.37 Å ͑a—the fcc unit cell parameter͒ to ensure that our observations are not volume speciﬁc. The results are shown in Figs. 1͑a͒ and 1͑b͒. We observe the identical phenomenon ͓Fig. 1͑c͔͒ in exactly the same way, but for a different, embedded-atom potential model for copper.18
When we heat a crystal at a constant volume ͑V͒, the pressure ͑P͒ increases with T. This is what we see for all isochores ͑Fig. 1͒. When T approaches TLS, a very small increase in the initial kinetic energy leads to melting ͑Fig. 1͒. Remarkably, at all volumes T, to which the system evolves, drops down to Tm ͑Fig. 1͒. Because of our way of heating the crystal, we know that the total energies at TLS and at Tm, at the same volume, are equal. This allows us to uncover the physical meaning of the TLS, which can be written as follows:

FIG. 1. The relation between the limit of superheating ͑TLS͒ and the melting temperature ͑Tm͒ of LJ solid at high ͑a͒ and low ͑b͒ pressures and embedded-atom model ͑EAM͒ of Cu ͑Ref. 18͒ ͑c͒. The melting curve of a LJ fcc crystal ͑Ref. 17͒ is shown by a solid line with open circles ͑a͒ and ͑b͒. The calculated isochores of the LJ are shown by solid curves with ﬁlled circles. Since the LJ melting
curve was calculated in Ref. 17 with a large step in P, we performed two-phase simulations ͑Refs. 19, 21, and 22͒ to determine more precisely the Tm at the pressures of 32.5 and 70 GPa. ͑The upper and lower bounds of Tm are shown by inverted and right ﬁlled triangles, respectively; their numerical values at the P = 32.5 GPa
are 2871 and 2921 K and at the P = 70.0 GPa they are 5133 and
5251 K; after TLS is reached the emerging, PT conditions are 32.56 GPa and 2918 K and at higher pressure 69.7 GPa and 5208 K.͒ One can see in ͑a͒ and ͑b͒ that the lower ends of the liquid parts of the isochores indeed correspond to the melting temperatures of the LJ solid. The same phenomenon holds for EAM Cu ͑c͒. After reaching the limit of superheating, the temperature of the system spontaneously drops to exactly ͑within the size of the symbols, which roughly represents the numerical error͒ the temperature of melting.

USolid͑V,TLS͒ = ULiquid͑V,Tm͒,

͑1͒

where U͑V , T͒ is the total energy of the system at volume V
and temperature T. After reaching TLS the T decreases because of the latent heat. We want to emphasize that Eq. ͑1͒ in no way follows from our simulation procedure. The drop of T to exactly Tm after reaching TLS is quite unexpected. We also note that in the MD runs, where we observed melting in the close vicinity of TLS, the T remained constant for about 60 000 timesteps. This is an indication that the initial assignment of velocities to the atoms does not initiate a melting. The melting is initiated at a later stage of evolution by the creation and accumulation of defects, possibly according to the mechanism described in previous works.15,16
The identity in Eq. ͑1͒ has an obvious physical meaning: the homogeneous melting occurs when the internal energy of the atoms in the solid state is sufﬁcient to explore the potential energy landscape of the liquid state. When this happens, the crystal melts to minimize the Helmholtz free energy. In heterogeneous melting a liquid gets stabilized by entropy. In a solid at T Ͻ TLS this mechanism is suppressed until, at TLS, the internal energy of the crystal becomes high enough to allow the atoms to leave their crystalline positions and diffuse within the sample. Equation ͑1͒ also tells us that one cannot provide a solid with an energy which is higher than that of a liquid without melting the solid. We have been able to derive this relation because we indeed reached the limit of superheating. We have noticed that scaling of velocities or connecting the system to a thermostat leads to homogeneous melting temperatures well below the TLS. Therefore, it is possible that some of the previous studies have not reached TLS.
To demonstrate that the absence of the states with high entropy is the reason for superheating, we performed twophase MD simulations.19–22 Normally, in a two-phase NPT MD simulation the solid is placed in contact with a liquid of the same composition, ensuring the equality of the Gibbs free energies of the solid and liquid at Tm.19,21,22 We also performed a two-phase MD simulation, however, the LJ parameters for the liquid were chosen quite differently from those for the solid. Therefore, the Gibbs free energies of the solid and liquid were different. Nevertheless, the solid in these two-phase MD simulations melted without superheating. This conﬁrms that the heterogeneity itself ͑i.e., the solidliquid interface, in this case͒ is sufﬁcient to ensure the equilibrium melting of the solid. In the context of our present study this means that if states with higher entropy were accessible, atoms would readily enter those states. Nowadays, it is assumed that in two-phase simulations19,20 one has to place a solid in contact with a liquid of the same composition. Our simulation demonstrates that an arbitrary liquid in contact with a solid also allows one to simulate melting without superheating. This also explains why the knowledge of the properties of a solid, without reference to the properties of the corresponding liquid phase, is sufﬁcient to predict its melting curve.23
In computer simulations of melting it was noticed that TLS is higher than Tm by about 20–30%. So far this observation did not have a quantitative explanation. Equation ͑1͒ provides the basis for the quantitative evaluation of the super-

FIG. 2. The relation between TLS and Tm for Al ͑Ref. 25͒ as a function of P ͑open squares͒. The triangles represent the error bars for each point.

heating limit. In the high pressure limit most of the melting curves of simple solids become rather ﬂat because of the small difference between the volumes of the liquid and solid due to the high pressure ͑see inset in Fig. 2͒. If we consider points 1, 2, and 3 ͑Fig. 2, inset͒, then from Eq. ͑1͒ it follows that
U2͑TLS,V͒ − U1͑Tm,V͒ = U3͑Tm,V͒ − U1͑Tm,V͒, ͑2͒
where Ui is the internal energy at the conditions ͑V and T͒ at the point i. Let us assume that the heat capacity of the solid at volume V and the temperature between TLS and Tm is equal to 3kB, and the energy change at melting is equal to TmkB ln 2 ͑⌬S = kB ln 2 is the asymptotic value of the entropy of

melting.24 Then, Eq. ͑2͒ can be written in the following form:

3kB͑TLS − Tm͒ = TmkB ln 2

the asymptotic value for the superheating limit. If one com-

pares this value with what was previously observed ͑e.g.,

Table VI in Ref. 25; see also Fig. 2͒, one comes to the con-

clusion that our consideration allows us to explain the par-

ticular value of superheating repeatedly observed in com-

puter simulations for as long as attempts to simulate melting

have been undertaken.

Since our simulations cover a wide range of pressures and include such different models of interaction as the LennardJones and embedded-atom method, we conjecture that Eq. ͑1͒ is a general law. This law ͓Eq. ͑1͔͒ allows us to introduce a simple method to determine Tm of a solid. However, in this method both a rather large number of atoms and long runs

are needed; therefore, it might be impractical to use it for ab
initio simulations. On the other hand, our method is simple,
quite general, and can be used to determine Tm of any substance.
The constant kAB = ln 2 / 3 ͓Eq. ͑4͔͒ relates TLS and Tm in the high pressure limit. The relation ͑4͒ allows us to explain

the magnitude of critical superheating routinely observed in simulations of melting.
