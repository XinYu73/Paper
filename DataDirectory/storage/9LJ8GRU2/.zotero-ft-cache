We study the robustness of multiparty entanglement under local decoherence, modeled by partially depo-
larizing channels acting independently on each subsystem. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the robustness of ͑GHZ͒ entanglement increases with the number of qubits. An n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ͑GHZ͒ state can stand more than 55% local depolarization in the limit n→ϱ. GHZ states are more robust than other generic states of three and four qubits. We also study spin-squeezed states in the limit n→ϱ and ﬁnd that they too can
stand considerable local depolarization.

Entanglement is certainly one of the most dramatically

nonclassical features of quantum physics. There are states of

composite quantum systems that cannot be decomposed into

probabilistic combinations of product states: there is no way

of writing the density matrix of such a state ␳ in the form

subsystem and the piϾ0 are probabilities. Such states ␳ are

called inseparable or entangled. One could say that for en-

tangled systems the whole is indeed more than the sum of its

parts. Only entangled states can exhibit quantum nonlocality

͓1͔. In this case, there is no way of reproducing the predic-

tions of quantum physics with classical systems, unless there

is instantaneous communication over arbitrary distances.

Entanglement has recently been studied extensively in the

context of quantum computation and quantum communica-

tion ͓2͔. Quantum computation would require the creation

and maintenance of highly complex entangled states of many

subsystems. This is a difﬁcult task because of decoherence

͓3͔. A system interacts with its surroundings, which creates

entanglement between system and environment, at the same

time reducing the entanglement within the system itself.

Such considerations lead to a natural physical question:

how common is complex entanglement—entanglement be-

tween many subsystems—in nature? Are there natural sys-

tems that contain substantial large-scale entanglement be-

tween their constituents? There seem to be two conﬂicting

intuitions in response to this question. On the one hand, en-

tanglement seems to be very fragile under decoherence,

which is emphasized by the difﬁculty of building a quantum

computer. On the other hand, measure-theoretic consider-

ations suggest that the set of inseparable states is much larger

than the set of separable ones ͓4͔, which seems to imply that

entanglement should be relatively common.

One might hope to gain some insight into the above ques-

tion by analyzing the behavior of complex entangled states

under decoherence, in particular, by studying how fast the

entanglement disappears. This is not an easy task, because it

requires practical criteria for inseparability. However, for

*Email address: christoph.simon@qubit.org †Email address: kempe@math.berkeley.edu

some special sets of states such criteria have been found

͓5,6͔, which we will use in the following.

We will consider the evolution of certain multiqubit states

under the action of partially depolarizing channels, to be de-

ﬁned below, acting independently on every qubit. The mul-

tiqubit states are our models for complex entanglement, and

the depolarizing channel is our toy model for decoherence,

corresponding to local and homogeneous noise. We ask how

much local depolarization is possible such that the states are

still entangled, in this way quantifying their robustness under

decoherence.

We are particularly interested in how the robustness of the

entanglement changes with the size of the system. One might

expect that for n, the number of subsystems, going to inﬁnity,

the entanglement should become more and more fragile. We

will show that for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger ͑GHZ͒-type

entanglement the exact opposite is the case. The states be-

come more robust under local depolarization when the num-

ber of qubits is increased.

Our notion of robustness is different from the one of ͓7͔,

who considered global mixing of entangled states with lo-

cally prepared noise. Admixing locally prepared noise is dif-

ferent from local decoherence; it corresponds to a scenario

where the local ‘‘decohering agents’’ communicate when to

add noise, and when to leave the system undisturbed.

It also differs from the notion of entanglement persistency

proposed in ͓8͔, which is deﬁned as the minimum number of

local measurements needed in order to deﬁnitely disentangle

a given state. This deﬁnition involves an optimization over

all possible local measurements. It thus corresponds to intel-

ligent and informed adversaries who optimize coordinated

decohering measurements in order to most efﬁciently destroy

the entanglement of a state. The depolarizing channels which

we consider here, applied to each subsystem, correspond to

independent measurements in random bases on each local

component of the entangled state.

We will consider qubits with basis states ͉0͘ and ͉1͘. The

completely depolarizing channel is deﬁned by the transfor-

mation

If the density matrix of the system is written in the basis of

Pauli matrices, one can easily convince oneself that Eq. ͑1͒

corresponds to multiplying all ␴i by the scaling factor s ϭ1Ϫd, while the unit matrix 1 remains unaffected.

An interesting physical realization of a partially depolar-

izing channel is by random measurements. One can show

that if a qubit is subjected to a Von Neumann measurement in

a basis chosen uniformly at random, the effect on the density

matrix corresponds to a partially depolarizing channel with

d ϭ 2/3.

We will refer to d as the amount of local depolarization.

or—in the absence of a necessary and sufﬁcient condition—

ceases to fulﬁll certain sufﬁcient conditions for entanglement

͓6,9͔. In both cases, dcrit(␳) will be a quantitative signature of the robustness of the entanglement in that state.

Our main interest is the behavior of the critical depolar-

ization for large systems. There are two families of states

where we have been able to obtain explicit results in the limit

of n, the number of subsystems, going to inﬁnity, namely,

GHZ states and spin-squeezed states ͓10͔ of n qubits. Our

main result is that, surprisingly, in both cases a very substan-

tial amount of local depolarization does not destroy the mul-

tiparty entanglement. For GHZ states, the critical depolariza-

tion even increases with n. We have also compared GHZ

states to other generic entangled states for nϭ3 and nϭ4

qubits, with ͑to us͒ counter-intuitive results.

For the following discussion, we ﬁnd it convenient to de-

ﬁne P0ϭ͉0͗͘0͉, P1ϭ͉1͗͘1͉, ␴ϩϭ͉0͗͘1͉, and ␴Ϫϭ͉1͗͘0͉. In this basis the partially depolarizing channel ͑1͒ corre-

In order to analyze the entanglement of states of the above

form it is sufﬁcient to study the entanglement for bipartite

cuts ͓5͔, where some qubits constitute one subsystem and all

the other qubits the other subsystem. For each such cut one

considers the partial transposition ͓9͔. As long as the partial

transpose of a state has negative eigenvalues, the state is

deﬁnitely entangled.

Take partial transposition of the ﬁrst k qubits as an ex-

ample.

The

states ͉1͘  k͉0͘  (nϪk) and ͉0͘  k͉1͘  (nϪk). It is then easy to

see that the state will have nonpositive partial transpose for

some bipartite cut, and thus will deﬁnitely be entangled, as

long as

for some k. In ͓5͔ it was moreover shown that if the state has positive partial transpose with respect to all bipartite cuts,

then it is separable, so that the above condition for insepara-
bility is both sufﬁcient and necessary.
The smallest eigenvalue ␭k is the one for kϭn/2, if n is even, or kϭm, for nϭ2mϩ1. Therefore, we can immedi-

ately make a statement about entanglement after local depolarization for general n ͑consider even n for simplicity͒. The state is deﬁnitely entangled as long as

A natural question to ask is how the robustness of the

GHZ state compares to other multiparty entangled states.

One might expect GHZ states to be particularly fragile, since

for example the loss of a single qubit from an n-qubit GHZ

state destroys the entanglement completely. It turns out that

under local depolarization GHZ entanglement is compara-

tively robust.

We do not know of any other family of multiqubit states

for which there is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for

entanglement. As a ﬁrst step, we have therefore chosen to

apply the partial transposition criterion ͓9͔ to some charac-

teristic states of three and four qubits. In the four-qubit case

ROBUSTNESS OF MULTIPARTY ENTANGLEMENT

TABLE I. Critical values of local depolarization d for which

several generic entangled states of three and four qubits become

PPT ͑with positive partial transpose͒. For the four-qubit states the

values for both the 1-3 and the 2-2 bipartite cuts are given. One sees

that G4, the four-qubit GHZ state, stays NPT ͑with negative partial transpose, and thus entangled͒ up to the largest value of depolariza-

tion, dcritϭ0.489. For the GHZ case PPT-ness and separability

are equivalent. The states considered were the following: ͉G3͘

we have studied both the 1-3 and the 2-2 bipartite cuts. These

results can be directly compared to the results in the GHZ

case, where the partial transposition criterion happens to be

necessary and sufﬁcient. Our results are collected in Table I.

The main—again surprising—conclusion is that GHZ states

are comparatively robust.

The states considered were the following. For nϭ3, the
state ͉W3͘ϭ1/ͱ3(͉001͘ϩ͉010͘ϩ͉100͘). For a symmetric
state of three qubits, there is just one possible bipartite cut

͑1-2͒. The state ͉W3͘ becomes PPT ͑with positive partial transpose͒ across this cut for a lower value of depolarization

than the three-qubit GHZ state, i.e., at least according to the

partial transposition criterion, it is less robust under local

depolarization.

For nϭ4, we have studied three different states,

namely,

repre-

senting different kinds of four-qubit entanglement. There is

only a single instance where one of them is more robust than

the four-qubit GHZ state: the 1-3 cut for ͉B4͘ remains NPT ͑with negative partial transpose͒ for higher values of depo-

larization. However, if the 2-2 cut is also taken into account,

again the GHZ state remains NPT for higher d values.

It is worth noting that the state ͉X4͘, which can also be
written as ͉X4͘ϭ1/ͱ6(͉00͉͘11͘ϩ2͉␺ϩ͉͘␺ϩ͘ϩ͉11͉͘00͘)
originally has more entanglement across the 2-2 cut than the

GHZ state: the Von Neumann entropy of the reduced state is

1.252 compared to 1 for the GHZ state ͑for pure states, the

Von Neumann entropy is a good measure of entanglement,

cf. ͓2͔͒. Nevertheless, it reaches the boundary of PPT states

before the GHZ state. A more trivial example for the fact that

the amount of entanglement and its robustness do not have a

simple relation is provided by any number of independent

shared two-qubit singlet states. Then the collective state is

exactly as robust ͑or fragile͒ as an individual singlet, which

has dcritϭ1Ϫscrit(2)ϭ0.423. Remarkably, there is also no positive correlation between

the Schmidt rank of the states with respect to the 2-2 cut ͑i.e.

the number of terms in the corresponding Schmidt decompo-

sition͒ and their robustness under local depolarization, cf.

͓11͔. The state ͉X4͘ has Schmidt rank 3, nevertheless it is less robust than the GHZ state, which has Schmidt rank 2.

Again, an even simpler example is provided by a state of two

independent

shared

singlets,

robust than the GHZ state of four qubits.

Let us note that the robustness of a state under local de-

polarization can be increased by local operations. To see this,

let us consider the states ͉G4͘ and ͉B4͘, where we will focus on the bipartite entanglement between qubits one and two on

the one hand and qubits three and four on the other hand.

a GHZ state by acting only on qubits three and four. Table I

shows that the critical depolarization with respect to the 2-2

bipartite cut is larger for the GHZ state than for the state

͉B4͘. There is one more class of states for which we were able

to study the entanglement robustness for a general number of

qubits n, in particular n tending towards inﬁnity, namely,

states exhibiting spin squeezing ͓10͔. An n-qubit state ͉␺͘ is

called spin squeezed, if it satisﬁes

but not a necessary, condition for entanglement, so the states

may well be entangled for even larger values of depolariza-

tion.

In the present paper, we have used local partially depolar-

izing channels as our model for decoherence, corresponding

to local and homogeneous noise. Our results emphasize that

the robustness of multiparty entangled states will in general

depend on the nature of the decoherence process. In particu-

lar, GHZ states have turned out to be surprisingly robust

under local depolarization. On the other hand, GHZ en-

tanglement is of course fragile under some other operations,

such as the loss of a single qubit, or the measurement of a

single qubit in the ͕͉0͘,͉1͖͘ basis. For the latter scenario it is

however worth noting that the measurement has to be per-

formed with certainty in order to destroy the entanglement.

To show this consider the state generated from the n-qubit

GHZ state ͉Gn͘ by performing local measurements in the ͕͉0͘,͉1͖͘ basis on every qubit with a probability p. Certain

measurement corresponds to pϭ1. This state is given by

It is entangled for all pϽ1, as can be seen from its partial transpose. Of course, the coefﬁcient of the inseparable term decreases exponentially.
One should certainly be careful in drawing general conclusions from a single simple model. Nevertheless, our results show that multiparty entanglement can be surprisingly robust under decoherence, and that the robustness can even increase with the number of parties. This suggests that largescale entanglement could be more frequent in natural systems than one might have expected. Persistent entanglement would deﬁnitely require the presence of an entanglementgenerating process—interactions between the subsystems, possibly in combination with external excitation—that competes with the decoherence. The competition between entanglement generation and decoherence in multiparty systems is a promising and fascinating topic for future research.
