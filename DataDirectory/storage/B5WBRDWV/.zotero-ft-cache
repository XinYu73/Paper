Abstract

The basic principle of entanglement processing says that entanglement cannot increase under local operations and classical communication. Based on this principle, we show that any entanglement measure E suitable for the regime of a high number of identically prepared entangled pairs satisfies E D ≤ E ≤ E F , where E D and E F are the entanglement of distillation and formation, respectively. Moreover, we exhibit a theorem establishing a very general form of bounds for distillable entanglement.

APS and the Physical Review Editorial Office Continue to Support Researchers

COVID-19 has impacted many institutions and organizations around the world, disrupting the progress of research. Through this difficult time APS and the Physical Review editorial office are fully equipped and actively working to support researchers by continuing to carry out all editorial and peer-review functions and publish research in the journals as well as minimizing disruption to journal access.

We appreciate your continued effort and commitment to helping advance science, and allowing us to publish the best physics journals in the world. And we hope you, and your loved ones, are staying safe and healthy.
Ways to Access APS Journal Articles Off-Campus

Many researchers now find themselves working away from their institutions and, thus, may have trouble accessing the Physical Review journals. To address this, we have been improving access via several different mechanisms. See Off-Campus Access to Physical Review for further instructions.
